# cs525-nlp-yelp
Final project for CS525: Natural Language Processing

Authors: Jack Ayvazian, Roopsa Ghosh, Dillon McCarthy

1. Proposed question
How can we generate reviews for a business given a rating and a business category?

2. Proposed method/algorithm/model (in general)
Neural Network, LSTM, GANs

3. Evaluation method
Testing a classifier (real/fake and trained on real, test on fake), analyzing cosine similarities

4. Any preliminary findings?
Loading and cleaning data
- Yelp data set is very large (> 4 mil)
- Load subset of data into a new file for use
