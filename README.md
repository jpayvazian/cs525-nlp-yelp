# cs525-nlp-yelp
Final project for CS525: Natural Language Processing

Authors: Jack Ayvazian, Roopsa Ghosh, Dillon McCarthy

### Motivation
How can we generate realistic reviews for restaurants given a rating (1-5 stars), text seed (to begin the review), and word/char limit?

### Models
* Word and Character based keras LSTM
* Fine tuned GPT2

### Evaluation
* Testing the accuracy of a classifier (e.g Logistic Regression, SVM) with real and generated reviews
* LSA Analysis on real/fake reviews to visualize how linearly separable the features are
* POS Tagging on Real vs. Fake

#### TODO
* Evaluation
* Presentation
