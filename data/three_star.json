usually pleasant periodtoken we have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting periodtoken we usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends commatoken in order to be done quicker periodtoken","4":"upland is a brewery based out of bloomington commatoken indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central indiana periodtoken  all of their beers are very good commatoken and i am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins periodtoken  therefore commatoken i was excited to try their pizza commatoken but i dont think it ended up being on par with these other items periodtoken  my margherita pizza had a crackerlike crust and was pretty light overall periodtoken  the cheese was good commatoken but none of the other toppings added much flavor periodtoken  there was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza periodtoken  my opinion is that uplands pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group commatoken but ill be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits periodtoken","17":"my food only merited maybe two stars but i will give an extra star because i like the menu and will try more of it and their design and concept periodtoken  sadly though commatoken my tomatobasil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp commatoken offputting flavor periodtoken  it was citrusy commatoken for sure commatoken and i love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering  i think next time i will focus on the dishes with cured italian meats commatoken mortadella and prosciutto periodtoken  and also the baked goods commatoken those sounded pretty good commatoken especially the nutella bruschetta","18":"a couple friends and i stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at more than just ice cream periodtoken well commatoken we just got ice cream periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot fully taking advantage of what the name implies commatoken but maybe next time periodtoken  3 milkshakes 1 coffee commatoken 1 chocolate commatoken and 1 blackwhite malt periodtoken   all were pretty good periodtoken definitely satisfied the ice cream craving periodtoken i thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker commatoken same goes for the chocolate periodtoken the blackwhite was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three periodtoken unfortunately commatoken i did not order that one so i settled for my not so creamy coffee periodtoken  i did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake periodtoken i tried the pumpkin pie which was amazing periodtoken i dont know why i didnt just get this periodtoken maybe a milkshake isnt the way to go here periodtoken","32":"this is a pretty good pancake place commatoken but its a little disorganized in the way its run when its really busy periodtoken the pancakes are pretty good but super sweet commatoken so you have to be in there periodtoken good price point periodtoken serves breakfast all day so thats definitely a plus commatoken but not anything particularly special that you couldnt get anywhere else periodtoken","41":"average or slightly above commatoken despite the hype periodtoken  on the expensive side periodtoken  for 10

commatoken 1 iced tea commatoken 1 burger commatoken 1 bison burger and split a large fry commatoken for about 37 periodtoken  rather ridiculous periodtoken and they try to hard to be different or interesting commatoken but ruin a good meal periodtoken  the bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and bbq on it to call it a carolina bison burger periodtoken  not worth 12 on its own periodtoken  been there periodtoken  done that periodtoken  no reason to go back periodtoken  next periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","47":"so much to like about this placethe beautiful mercer building location commatoken the spaciousness commatoken the lovely commatoken friendly baristas periodtoken but there are a couple of important cons for me periodtoken biggest being commatoken the music is constant and too loud commatoken ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do read commatoken work commatoken reflect commatoken or enjoy a good conversation periodtoken when i asked for it to be turned down commatoken they told me they cantit just plays at one level all the time commatoken and the speakers  are everywhere so you cant get away from it periodtoken it sucks periodtoken  secondly commatoken if youre a tea drinker commatoken youre out of luck periodtoken they dont serve the tea in pots commatoken but huge commatoken sloppy individual filtersit makes your beverage totally ungainly commatoken hard to drink and is really off putting periodtoken  pros gluten free goodies and yummy italian sodas periodtoken id love to spend more time here commatoken but the music usually drives me out after 10 minutes periodtoken","57":"went on a sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there periodtoken  we sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items periodtoken  no worries commatoken we just wanted a couple of beers periodtoken  we sampled several varieties commatoken all of which were average periodtoken  nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late periodtoken  i get it commatoken but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear periodtoken  kind of put a damper on things periodtoken  cool location and cool place commatoken but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by periodtoken","58":"its my first time here and the service is slow periodtoken the employees dont have good attitude

commatoken the sweet potato pancakes and the san antonio periodtoken i got the sugar and spice pancakes periodtoken all were well and fine commatoken a bit dry periodtoken i dont understand the hype commatoken but if the line isnt too long its not bad for normal breakfast food periodtoken if the line is longer i would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to fido  insanely good coffee and great breakfast food periodtoken","75":"awesome location commatoken good service is why i have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on periodtoken mostly the excuses about the steak is why i have to write the review periodtoken i am happy to pay more for good quality steak but dont blame the poor guy that sold it to you ","86":"food is good commatoken but the cafe itself is extremely dirty periodtoken i will probably not return unless they clean the place up periodtoken","93":"we have big group of 12 for the office outing lunch periodtoken i would said for the number of people we have commatoken the service is not the best but good enough periodtoken only one of our members get the food late periodtoken the close out may need to work on it periodtoken tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy periodtoken   i have order the lamb kebab shish kebab plate periodtoken it come with two choices of side periodtoken i got

oily periodtoken but overall they are good periodtoken we liked the shrimp spring rolls a lot periodtoken it is one of the best we have tried periodtoken   the place could have earned higher points

5  7 margaritas periodtoken  i also believe wings are 12 off periodtoken  my friends seemed to enjoy their orders of burritos commatoken gaucamole and enchiladas periodtoken    the food is average and

ordered and the food took a fair amount of time commatoken understandable because of such a large party periodtoken problem was commatoken when the food came out commatoken no server knew what wed

periodtoken i also ordered the spicy beef pho commatoken which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes periodtoken  the wait for the check and processing payment was long and arduous commatoken a problem again because we had a lyft driver waiting outside for us periodtoken  all in all commatoken go for the food commatoken not for the service

nonexistent commatoken side of onion rings too greasy  would not order again  the overall experience is okay commatoken better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean commatoken inside is very small periodtoken service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated periodtoken  is it worth a visit yes commatoken but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a

throw in a couple of olives commatoken some artichoke hearts commatoken some sliced pepperoncinis periodtoken maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasnt very flavorful either

periodtoken  my first visit was a kinda a let down periodtoken  i had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in indianapolis commatoken but i only found 2 that i liked and only 1 was memorable periodtoken  however commatoken bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps commatoken i like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer periodtoken   the tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area periodtoken  i only gave them 3stars this time but i look forward to improving their score after future visits periodtoken","228":"the food is delicious but the service has

for my health and safety periodtoken darn shame too as i really did like this place commatoken but i must admit that i still am not confident they have their act in order periodtoken my suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165\u00b0f temp commatoken serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead commatoken and only source their greens and veggies from usa only sources periodtoken avoid mexico as they have big issues with water pollution crosscontamination periodtoken","291":"place for latest night eats around and drive through is a

sure i received the best possible service periodtoken i ordered two slices of cake commatoken one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake periodtoken both were delicious commatoken but it seemed like

told me id better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in periodtoken not sure why id paid such a high price to practically make my own halfcoffee halfmild beverage commatoken i simply smiled and walked away periodtoken i ended up throwing out the drink as i could hardly even taste the coffee and im not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee periodtoken nonetheless commatoken the cakes were delicious

to go if you live in north philly periodtoken i take this joint any day over fresh grocer periodtoken   the only complaints i have is with the produce which is expected considering it is cousins after

its too cold or youre feeling to cheap to go to trader joes commatoken cousins is the place to head to periodtoken","404":"this is actually a 3 12 star review for me periodtoken only because everything that i wanted they did not have or werent willing to do periodtoken firstly commatoken i came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when i told the lady taking my order commatoken she said they dont do that  periodtoken then i wanted that buttermilk bites and they werent available commatoken however commatoken my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that oh yes commatoken and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry periodtoken i liked the sliders i had though fried chicken commatoken beef belly and catfishokay periodtoken and the sundae is pretty tasty periodtoken good for a first try but not to continue coming periodtoken","407":"atmosphere is adorable 5 stars

periodtoken  i had biked passed 16th street seafood a ton of times commatoken always wondering what was going on inside periodtoken  now i know the answer commatoken and the answer is not much periodtoken at least in terms of decor periodtoken there is a gumball machine commatoken 2 empty candy machines commatoken plus a counter to order at and thats pretty much it periodtoken also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood periodtoken there were some frozen crab cakes commatoken breaded fish fillets commatoken clams commatoken and crabs but not else periodtoken still commatoken i threw caution to the winds of tasker street and put in an order periodtoken  i didnt want to go for fried seafood commatoken so the sandwiches and platters were out periodtoken  i got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce 9 periodtoken50 periodtoken mussels are one of those things i like making at home commatoken but it is way too hot for that right now periodtoken  periodtoken my main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells  9   it was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy commatoken broth periodtoken as the place is togo only they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders commatoken nothing was spilled periodtoken  remember when i said i didnt want anything fried commatoken well thats not ever actually true periodtoken so i ended up sneaking in 2 fried shrimps periodtoken not bad commatoken but not worth 1 periodtoken25 each

commatoken and an item was missing every time periodtoken a disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restaurant periodtoken","467":"i like to make a stop at this walmart since its located in meadowlark where my doctors office is periodtoken  its smaller than  the supercentre but i find it has a decent selection of items in the food section where the prices are cheaper than the nearby stores periodtoken  the produce section can have limited items though with just the basics in stock periodtoken  i find the snacks and canned food section are fine with good prices periodtoken  as for the rest of the store and items commatoken well its hit or miss periodtoken  i was looking for lightbulbs and they only had one brand of the type i was looking for and it was a energy efficient so pricier than others if they had in stock periodtoken  however commatoken the price i paid for the item was probably cheaper than other stores periodtoken    dont expect much help if you need help finding an item periodtoken  associates seem to be difficult to find unless you count some of the younger staff who like racing shopping carts in the store as they were on my last visit periodtoken    the check outs can have at most 5 cashiers working but i find the time in the line ups is never too long so thats good periodtoken","479":"johnny rockets is on the pricey side commatoken you arent getting outta here with a burger and fries for any less than 10 bucks and thats without a drink periodtoken the burgers are 67 bucks and definitely solid for the price though periodtoken i had the route 66 commatoken 13 pound commatoken nice soft potato roll commatoken meat good and lean commatoken pretty damn tasty and satisfying periodtoken wish i could say the same about the friesrings i tried the mix but theyre the standard freezer bag affair commatoken and the fries are actually subpar dry and not much flavor commatoken worse than most fast food fries periodtoken the onion rings were better commatoken but of course they cost almost twice as much periodtoken  ill be back to try more burgers but would suggest just sticking to the burger or cheesesteak with no sides maybe grab a shake for dessert instead  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the basic hot dog at 3 also costs about the same as an order of fries periodtoken","490":"ok beer periodtoken ok food periodtoken we like breweries because we have a kid and like beer periodtoken so we go to a lot of breweries periodtoken the service was excellent periodtoken food commatoken beer commatoken good","496":"chicken was awesome loved the char and the garlic marinade periodtoken i cant say the same for the rest of the meal rice was cold but flavorful and probably would have tasted better if it was warm and dryer periodtoken the hummus was average and the falafel was just awful periodtoken im arab so i know my fair share of felafel periodtoken this was not even acceptable in my standards for america everything was fresh though which is why i gave it a 3  epic chicken periodtoken not worth the wait and the possible risk of being yelled at periodtoken too much hype for just the experience periodtoken  ps if you want real falafel and epic hummus commatoken walk down the street to mamas periodtoken","501":"this place is solid periodtoken  the fleur de liis omelette makes my day periodtoken  i can also get

12 a mediterranean salad periodtoken  the soup was really yummy with a sprinkle of cilantro and avocado on top periodtoken    the salad was more eh commatoken i think the dressing that comes with it is too salty periodtoken    but i am looking to go back for the pizza  hopefully they can make a cheeseless one","505":"its a crazy place with surprisingly good service commatoken decent food commatoken and the weirdo clientele you would expect in this area periodtoken im really enjoying this little family reunion with the deadbeat drunk father oj and the crazy white guy in the corner and his random outbursts periodtoken","506":"didnt care for this place periodtoken we shared the big easy breakfast and it was okay periodtoken the food was barely warm commatoken and the whole meal was eh except for the pancakes periodtoken the pancakes were good commatoken wouldve tasted better if they were warmer periodtoken  the hot chocolate was good commatoken thick chocolate commatoken and it came in a togo cup which was convenient periodtoken the service was also good periodtoken we arrived on a friday morning around 815 am and there was no wait commatoken but it was starting to fill up periodtoken by the time we left there were a few people waiting outside periodtoken","524":"although the chicken is always very good commatoken there was a sulky male employee on sunday commatoken jan 1 with a pussface putting my package together 16 pc grilled chicken meal periodtoken  out in the open he was complaining about work periodtoken  honestly commatoken if he doesnt like working there or the pay commatoken the manager should allow him to make a decision commatoken change his attitude or leave periodtoken  this doesnt leave customers with a positive feeling about the place commatoken especially when he didnt load all that was supposed to be in my order periodtoken  wheres the rollsbiscuits  pay attention commatoken it doesnt cost anything periodtoken","526":"starbucks periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenso arent they all just clones  a review would be futile if youve already visited one before periodtoken  coffee is  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenok periodtoken  its more like coffee flavored water to me commatoken but does the trick when called upon periodtoken  i much prefer some home brewed new orleans style coffee  chicory periodtoken  chicory makes the coffee periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken starbuckathons have no clue what real coffee is like periodtoken","531":"their pizza was ok commatoken i think they need to cook the pizzas alittle more and have more tastier cheese periodtoken they do have a large delivery area in southern tampa commatoken as well as ybor periodtoken","533":"great atmosphere commatoken above average burgers commatoken but super cool drink selection  both alcoholic and non alcoholic periodtoken  they have pretty much every kind of soda style you can think of and some really tasty spiked shakes periodtoken  definitely a fun place to be at no matter what youre feeling periodtoken","535":"visited last night with a group of six periodtoken ambiance and service was excellent commatoken theyve done a great job with the space periodtoken the salsa and table side guacamole are very good periodtoken however the three stars are attributed to less than spectacular entrees that are slightly over priced for mexican food and everyone in our group had drinks that were all consistently weak i periodtokene periodtoken tasted like less than an ounce of alcohol periodtoken i would give 3 periodtoken5 stars if possible commatoken but i see this as a second or third option in the tampa area for mexican cuisine periodtoken","570":"good downtown breakfast stop periodtoken great service commatoken food wasnt exactly perfect commatoken but i tend to be hard to please in these regards periodtoken i hear lunch is really good also periodtoken","580":"ok this is an aberration from my city foodie reviews but i figured ill take the time and review some of the local establishments that i order from on a consistent base while working in bensalem commatoken p periodtokena periodtoken  without further adieu periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken georges chix is good periodtoken  im always satisfied with the food and value each and every time periodtoken  i havent branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me im not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu usually i get the nuggetfriessoda deal commatoken the chix fingersfriessoda deal commatoken or ceasar wrapfriessoda deal 8 or 9 after a nice tip but the food is alright periodtoken give georges a try if youre in town and looking to get down on some fried grub","587":"this is a great place to visit if you enjoy large crowds and overspending periodtoken  they have plenty of delicious deli and bakery items available but you generally cant see either case over crowds while you wait commatoken and if you dont know your order immediately when your numbers called you are s periodtokeno periodtokenl they will very quickly call the next person in line so my advice would be to arrive the second they open so that you actually stand a chance of seeing the cases periodtoken  its a great place for extroverts commatoken but its very small and very very full of people commatoken so if youre the type of person who is not into that sort of thing commatoken i would probably try to go in the most nonpeak hours you can periodtoken","592":"we went on a friday evening around 530 and were seated outside on the covered patio right away periodtoken we ordered 2 apps and a flight periodtoken the chorizo nachos were huge and decent but the trout dip with pita bread chips is what stood out the dip came out with 6 pieces of bread placed in a circle around the dip periodtoken i asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it was free score  since both items were appetizers they came out in a matter of 5 minutes periodtoken all around it was a wonderful experience with good weather commatoken great service commatoken good food and a flight with information about each beer","601":"if youre a fan of sweets commatoken this spot is worth visiting periodtoken  theyre wellknown for their pralines commatoken but there are plenty of other desserts to choose from here periodtoken  they even have guys in the front or back of the store making pralines that you can watch periodtoken","618":"wawa is what it is periodtoken a convenient store that has an array of options periodtoken  the prices are reasonable periodtoken their food is only okay though periodtoken ive had their sandwiches a few times periodtoken my biggest gripe is i do not like their tomatoes periodtoken i think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard periodtoken i could be wrong about the reason commatoken but they are hard nonetheless periodtoken  they also have a few premade hot items periodtoken the hot dogs are okay periodtoken but its hard to mess up a hot dog periodtoken they hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average periodtoken cheap and quick but so not worth it periodtoken  go hear for a candy bar commatoken drink commatoken or other package snack item periodtoken dont go here for anything thats actually prepared by them periodtoken its just not that good periodtoken","621":"good beer periodtoken much better than most beer made in stl periodtoken sweet periodtoken if you love sweet periodtoken   ambiance is sterile periodtoken no vibe periodtoken looks like an office building periodtoken destination spot periodtoken","632":"great food and drinks commatoken albeit overpriced i had the salt of the earth cocktail and it had great flavor periodtoken the angry chicken chicken taco was good commatoken but one wasnt very filling periodtoken we had the shiitake commatoken lemon and cauliflower pizza as an appetizer and it had good flavor as well periodtoken","635":"the service was great and everything definitely tasted very fresh periodtoken i especially liked the guacamole  i tried the mole and mango chicken tacos and i felt they lacked just a little bit of flavor periodtoken ill definitely go back though and try some different varieties periodtoken","636":"panda express is like going to a jiffy lube  you know there are much better places commatoken and your leery about going to either but you still do because its so quick and easy  panda express is ok and i love how they have the little stickers on the serving line swearing they use no msg  but you wonder why you bloat up after eating there   believe it not i dont have any complaints about panda express commatoken i think its great commatoken its just one of those places where if you choose to go here and its not good all you can do is slap yourself and ask yourself what did you really expect and go about your day   one thing for sure  its is really quick and thats perfect when your in a hurry","644":"i have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night periodtoken simply commatoken the beer is just ok periodtoken i love good beer but i will drink it whether i think it is amazing or awful periodtoken i got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler batch 100 commatoken winter warmer commatoken undead black ipa and paramount periodtoken they were decent commatoken nothing to write home about or come back the next day for periodtoken the reason they lose points from last night was because of the food commatoken not the beer periodtoken  got a black and blue burger periodtoken it had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries periodtoken the price is steep for their higher end food but i think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time periodtoken  p periodtokens periodtoken for anyone looking to avoid big parties commatoken babies and young kids 112 years old i have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them periodtoken kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant periodtoken not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar periodtoken","654":"ill go back periodtoken got a lb of brisket and a lb of pulled pork periodtoken both were very very yummy periodtoken im shorting them stars for the sides commatoken though periodtoken at the risk of sounding full of myself my mac and cheese is better periodtoken also their burnt end beans were too heavy on the mustard for me periodtoken my kids dug their shoe string fries periodtoken ill definitely go back for the meat periodtoken maybe ill give the coleslaw a try periodtoken","657":"im from stl and sadly commatoken i never had ted drewes until recently periodtoken i always see long lines so i figured id give it a try periodtoken i went to the location on south grand and the ice was good but the service was terrible periodtoken the staff was rude and impatient while i tried to figure out what i wanted periodtoken maybe ill try the one on hampton next time periodtoken","669":"second time to visit mazarin in three years periodtoken  three years ago it was great commatoken including the breakfast periodtoken    but this last visit commatoken dec 2016 commatoken not too good periodtoken  i never got an answer to three phone calls previous to the visit periodtoken  three different days and three different times of day so commatoken i emailed to request courtyard view periodtoken  my superior bedroom was facing the courtyard but it did not view the courtyard periodtoken  i was put on the third floor which viewed  the top of a tarp that covered the courtyard during inclement weather periodtoken  only the weather was not inclement  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i suppose they were too tired to remove tarp periodtoken  they are very busy periodtoken never got answer to email either  we booked the room for two people and had to request two wash clothes each day since there were none periodtoken  the concierge never looked up from her pc to welcome guests and it would look better if she would smile periodtoken she probably wasnt feeling well  doorman was great and the desk service was prompt periodtoken  the breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this price point periodtoken  it seemed cooked hours previously commatoken then placed on steam trays periodtoken  similar to what is served in la quinta periodtoken  eggs were scrambled and stiff commatoken bacon was limp and chewy and all the breads were stale and cold periodtoken  juice and coffee were fine periodtoken  we stayed three days but only ate breakfast there the first periodtoken  even though breakfast cost was included in the room cost periodtoken  hint to cooks if you keep scrambled eggs on steam trays they continue to cook and become over done periodtoken  also breads commatoken bagels and croissants are baked fresh daily in the quarter periodtoken  it would be good to serve it periodtoken  on the better side the rooms were very clean and when the drain in the shower was slow commatoken leaving us standing in an inch of water commatoken they sent maintenance man right away and repaired it periodtoken  slept well every night  i am sorry but we will not be staying a third time and cannot recommend this hotel as a 4 or 5 star hotel periodtoken","670":"small menu commatoken seems like a neighborhood diner atmosphere periodtoken we had the biscuits and gravy and the slinger commatoken which comes with sausage instead of hamburger periodtoken iced coffee is truly just black coffee served over large chunks of ice periodtoken food was good commatoken but nothing was great periodtoken very small dining room with family style communal seating periodtoken first time trying commatoken but probably wont be back periodtoken","684":"im going to make the bold statement and say that im kind of an ice cream fanatic periodtoken whenever i get ready for a trip commatoken researching ice cream shops is at the top of my todo list periodtoken i dont care if its the dead of winter periodtoken you take coffee breaks i take ice cream breaks periodtoken i realize that i take this obsessionaddiction to an unhealthy extreme commatoken as ive been known to eat it for dinner periodtoken   with that said commatoken you can imagine that i was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp periodtoken when reading the reviews commatoken i was convinced that creole creamery was going to be the birite of the south best ice cream ive ever had periodtoken i had some pretty high expectations periodtoken unfortunately commatoken it did not deliver quite like i thought it would but it certainly wasnt bad periodtoken   my main problem is that out of the 3 flavors i had commatoken they all tasted identical periodtoken i got the basil coconut  lavender and my sister got the rose periodtoken these were some of the most unique flavors they offered and youd think theyd be pretty distinguishable from one another periodtoken alas commatoken neither of us could taste much difference periodtoken the flavors were extremely subtle periodtoken  what i did love however was the creaminess and texture periodtoken this is where it gets close to the birite status periodtoken the ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency periodtoken you simply cant buy something like this in the store periodtoken had the flavors wowed me commatoken i would have given this 5 stars commatoken hands down and it truly would have become the birite of the south in my book periodtoken  all in all commatoken i will definitely go back periodtoken i mean commatoken its still great ice cream periodtoken and im sure if i tried a more traditional flavor commatoken the taste would be stronger periodtoken i just really love the weird stuff ","685":"its a local deli periodtoken prices are high commatoken but that is the normal deal for places like this periodtoken they dont always put prices on their stuff which is sometimes annoying periodtoken  i go here often because it is close commatoken all the employees are very friendly and they always pet my dog periodtoken","687":"totally agree with the other lone and 1st review commatoken the staffing at this store is dysfunctional and the merchandising is poor at best periodtoken   and commatoken to make matters worse many of the centerstore packaged product prices are not competitive to other merchants in the area periodtoken  there are some perks commatoken if you live nearby its of course convenience periodtoken  the other nice perk is that lancaster brand steaks are very good and at this acme theyre always fresh commatoken good grill cuts commatoken and they are very reasonably priced periodtoken","692":"a great place for breakfast  the parking situation is a little difficult with them only having a small area for cars periodtoken i dont live nearby so its always a task to get a good space periodtoken the times ive gone early in the morning it has been a little hectic and crowded periodtoken i will say  the food is delicious periodtoken the coffee is better than most i periodtokene periodtoken starbucks commatoken duncan donuts  its a cut above the rest","695":"love this place with the vibrant colors on a sunday morning after a night out we loved the bloody mary bar commatoken however they were out of almost everything and they didnt replace periodtoken our waitress was not with it periodtoken we have 8 people and it was about a 2 hour trip commatoken 30 min of that was her just trying to figure out the bills commatoken credit cards and payments periodtoken it was bad periodtoken","699":"decent place for lunch periodtoken overall service is good with friendly employees periodtoken","702":"was in town looking for breakfast places and this place had a super high rating periodtoken  im pretty picky when it comes to ordering biscuits and gravy because i like the way i make them periodtoken  lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper periodtoken  i gave it a try periodtoken  the sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice periodtoken  i didnt enjoy the biscuits periodtoken  they were very hard and smothering them in gravy didnt help much periodtoken  i also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign periodtoken  it was a bit pricy periodtoken  all in all commatoken pretty good periodtoken","710":"love their juice double burgers with bacon and cheese periodtoken their new location at la cumbre plaza offer even better burgers periodtoken","722":"customer service is where its at periodtoken look at this place periodtoken decent lunch and breakfast food periodtoken i mean it all tastes great but its just basic stuff commatoken nothing different from the trucks on campus periodtoken except one thing periodtoken periodtoken richie hes the man commatoken hes made himself a local celebrity on campus with his great attitude and awesome service periodtoken im telling you hes a genius because why do i choose to come here over any other place on campus richie of course periodtoken","732":"experienced this restaurant 8042013 with friends periodtoken we decided to sit in the courtyard commatoken which had a lovely ambiance periodtoken however the the square table for four was much more suited to a table for two commatoken really felt cramped periodtoken  the wines we chose were really good we had the cabernet sauvignon and our friend had the malbec which she really enjoyed periodtoken  for dinner i chose the salmone campagnolo commatoken the mash potatoes were great however the salmon was definately overcooked and very dry and lacked flavor periodtoken everyone else chose the saltimbocca commatoken which was also nothing special commatoken have had better on the hill periodtoken   visited august 2013","735":"if you want to get in and out quick commatoken this kfctaco bell is ok for a fast food place periodtoken    i went with my brother early evening commatoken and got two hot wing boxes periodtoken  the chicken wings were a little over cooked and overpriced periodtoken  i wouldnt say you get a great value for portion sizes periodtoken  the hours are not late at this location periodtoken  the few times i have been here commatoken the food hasnt so been great either periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken overall commatoken customer service is pretty good periodtoken    go here if youre having a craving for either taco bell or kfc periodtoken    xoxo","739":"this is the best pizza by far in reno periodtoken crisp crust and loaded with toppings periodtoken it was amazing","740":"maybe ill write an updated review bc i really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place commatoken i wasnt that impressed periodtoken i got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries which didnt even taste in season periodtoken i should have tried some of their other flavors periodtoken maybe next time periodtoken","753":"i miss mexically commatoken but if you cant make the trekwait in line for don memos then this is a decent option periodtoken  most recently i had the chicken tostada periodtoken  it was a ton of food commatoken but it didnt wow me periodtoken  the flavors are kind of bland periodtoken  i wish they didnt charge for guacamole periodtoken  its cheap commatoken quick mexican style food periodtoken","765":"i ordered the combo vermicelli and was pretty disappointed periodtoken the meat portion was very small compared to the huge portion of rice noodle they gave me make it look like theres a lot of food periodtoken the combo cake with 2 bland shrimp commatoken 1 eggroll and a few pieces of marinated beef periodtoken i also ordered an iced viet coffee which was pretty decent periodtoken it wasnt as strong as the ones you would get from 626 or oc area periodtoken however commatoken its pretty good coming from sb periodtoken i think they diluted the flavor a bit as well periodtoken overall commatoken i would come back for their viet coffee but not for their main course periodtoken","770":"super cute place came during lunch and i had the fig salad and it was really good although id probably ask for the dressing on the side next time since it was a bit much for me periodtoken would definitely go again for another day date","775":"fast food style greek food periodtoken  i would bet most of the 4 or 5 stars are from late night college students after a few drinks periodtoken  i would not be afraid to return for lunch as it is quick commatoken clean commatoken priced right commatoken and the food was solid periodtoken  however commatoken i have had much better gyros and fries periodtoken  everyone talked about the wings and the staff said they were great commatoken so maybe next time i will go that route and update the review periodtoken","781":"we are still fans of taco bus over casita periodtoken it was evening when we arrived commatoken and casita taqueria had a few customers periodtoken we were met with smiles and a very cheerful commatoken charming staff periodtoken  they explained the menu to us and we were left to order periodtoken  my wife ordered a shrimp casitas bowl and i had the carne asada taco and the barbacoa taco periodtoken  the meal came out fast and periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken well we werent blown away at all periodtoken  i had been waiting for months to come here to the best taco place in st periodtoken pete commatoken but i was disappointed periodtoken  my tacos flavors were muddled and colorless commatoken while the hot sauce was missing that wow factor as well periodtoken  the shrimp casitas bowl was just ok per my wifes review and it too was just missing that something periodtoken   so for service commatoken you guys are awesome  but for the flavor commatoken we just needed that over the top commatoken nextlevel commatoken umami type of mexican that we have been exposed to lately periodtoken","797":"this was my first time commatoken but my dining companion has been before and pointed out a few changes periodtoken i had the portobello stuffed pretzel and he had the black bean burger periodtoken both were fine periodtoken our complaint was with the sides periodtoken the options were ruffles or store bought pasta salad periodtoken my companion said they used to have sweet potato fries so he was really disappointed since thats why we came periodtoken i think well stick to stopping in for a drink and skip eating there periodtoken","798":"only good thing about this place are the fries periodtoken the burgers are not that special or great periodtoken ordered the double mushroom and got more mushrooms than burger patty periodtoken almost reminds me of a mcdonalds burger patty periodtoken even with 2 patties the burger felt mediocre at best periodtoken greasy mushrooms and a soggy bun periodtoken came out to 12 with drink and fries and still felt hungry afterwards periodtoken if you want a real burger and fries commatoken try a true authentic local place periodtoken","800":"acme in flourtown is good for a small local grocery store periodtoken its clean commatoken has a fairly decent layout and selection and the staff is pretty good periodtoken if youre looking to grab something quick its the best option close by periodtoken the genuardis in flourtown and acme in ft washington both kinda suck  however commatoken if youre looking to do some heavy commatoken stocking up commatoken grocery shopping youre probably better off heading somewhere else periodtoken","801":"not bad commatoken not bad periodtoken  went there for lunch and liked the variety of spice levels periodtoken  also liked that the lunch buffet did not have too many mediocre things commatoken but rather had a dozen well made dishes in smaller batches periodtoken  service was above average and cleanliness is next to excellent periodtoken","807":"my husband and i have been here a number of times and the food is typical beach eatery  i always enjoyed the food periodtoken today  commatoken however  commatokenthe  platter i ordered was pretty bad periodtoken crab cake  commatoken not much crab was lukewarm and mushy commatoken scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry periodtoken nothing was hot periodtoken  not going back anytime soon server was very nice though periodtoken","810":"the good plush beds commatoken huge flat screen tv commatoken nice toiletries and great location periodtoken very nice staff periodtoken  the bad the hotel was under renovation commatoken so there was construction outside and tarps making a nice courtyard look like a junkyard periodtoken we got stuck in the 3rd world country wing  i think bc we got a cheap rate where the air system was loud and obnoxious commatoken and the wifi was broken periodtoken we had to take an elevator then a stair case to our room periodtoken the breakfast everyone raves about is quite mediocre compared to a spread places like the intercontinental and other upscale hotels put together periodtoken","835":"3 periodtoken5 stars  hubs and i decided to stop in this place after driving past it on several occasions periodtoken  i am very glad we did because we find all kinds of deals here periodtoken  granted commatoken we sometimes overshop because of low prices commatoken but with the savings we are actually breaking even periodtoken  how do i know prices are good  well i am one of those people that commatoken for whatever reason commatoken tends to memorize prices from my other grocery retailers whether i want to or not periodtoken  for example commatoken a 20 ounce red bull here is 2 periodtoken40 while the exact same thing at another store is in the 4 periodtoken50 range periodtoken    just this past weekend we bought a keurig k300 for 80 periodtoken80 periodtoken  the same item retailed for over 100 at several other places nearby periodtoken  so why just 3 periodtoken5 stars if i am saving money and am now flush with cash  well the downside is that unlike a typical grocery chain you cannot necessarily find all the brands you are looking for when shopping periodtoken  that makes it inevitable that i have to make a trip to a separate store if i have specific needs which cannot be met at iga periodtoken  but i do start my shopping here to get what i can before i go to round two periodtoken  the employees are helpful commatoken the place is neat and clean and the prices rock periodtoken  sarcasm  im never flush with cash periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","838":"we may have visited on an off day periodtoken tacos and gauc were good but no comparison to funky taco periodtoken 15 for a cold glass of the only cab sauv on the menu was disappointing periodtoken seriously commatoken that much for a glass of wine  mushroom taco that said was a mix of many mushrooms was all portobellos with one shiitake mushroom not ok periodtoken great setting but need to refine quality periodtoken blackened fish taco had no blackening periodtoken might try again commatoken maybe periodtoken","842":"one of the best places on washington avenue to sit outside and relax periodtoken  a very relaxing atmosphere both inside and out commatoken with service to match periodtoken  we enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions periodtoken   one of the best features of blondies is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous commatoken blondies is a nice oasis away from all of this periodtoken   food and drink blondies offers an above average list of wines by the glass commatoken and some very nice beer selections periodtoken  i enjoyed several red wines commatoken a cava commatoken and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits periodtoken  they also offer a limited menu of smaller plates commatoken charcuterie and the likes commatoken from which i have not ordered periodtoken  given their offerings commatoken im sure these are quite nice periodtoken  also a very nice feature is their 4 wine nights on wednesdays commatoken which is always a plus periodtoken  we will definitely be back in the future periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","849":"3 stars means i like it and ill be back for more periodtoken i love cuban food periodtoken  i lived in tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of cuban food periodtoken

commatoken pork and cafe con leche periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenjust to name a few periodtoken  today commatoken we got the cuban sandwich and the plantains periodtoken they were both really good periodtoken the portion size of the sandwich was huge periodtoken it could easily be shared periodtoken the pork and ham were good periodtoken  there were two big misses periodtoken the biggest miss is the bread periodtoken its just not right periodtoken it was almost the consistency of a cracker periodtoken it wasnt bad commatoken but all of the cuban bread ive ever eaten was much better periodtoken even if its pressed commatoken ive never had crackerlike cuban bread periodtoken  cuban bread is something that i would order as a side commatoken i love it so much periodtoken this bread missed the mark periodtoken  maybe i missed it commatoken but there was no yucca on the menu periodtoken i really love good cuban yucca periodtoken that was the other miss periodtoken","850":"met a friend for dinner there about 5pm commatoken based on his recommendation periodtoken  we tried some of the craft beer  the porter was very good periodtoken  ordered dinner commatoken ribs and brisket combination periodtoken  the brisket was moist and held together well commatoken but not too fatty periodtoken  the ribs were flavorful as well periodtoken  what was disappointing though commatoken was the portion size periodtoken  my friend and i both commatoken almost simultaneously commatoken mentioned how small the serving size was for the price periodtoken our server was prompt commatoken attentive and friendly periodtoken will i go back next time im in town  probably periodtoken  but next time ill try lunch and a sandwich periodtoken","860":"drexelpenn student joint periodtoken good

space periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengood mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops periodtoken plenty of outdoor seating on nice days periodtoken  the prices are periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensteep periodtoken but i always feel good about supporting a local small business commatoken so whatever periodtoken my real problem is the tude and just general lack of professionalism that ive seen from the baristas periodtoken they clearly know their coffee commatoken and thats great commatoken but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month  purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar periodtoken my mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a heads up periodtoken his answer yeah commatoken were actually out of half and half periodtoken everyone stared blankly at him commatoken including the other people in line periodtoken

literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us periodtoken ummmmmm periodtoken as my mom said commatoken when you charge people 8 for two coffees one of which was just a drip coffee commatoken i dont think its too much to ask that you provide half and half at your coffee shop periodtoken   another time i was there commatoken a friend asked for her coffee extra hot commatoken and then when it arrived just warm commatoken she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute periodtoken she was very nice about it periodtoken the girl behind the counter commatoken on the

then reluctantly offered to add some hot water periodtoken uhhhh periodtoken homegirl periodtoken could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem put it in a to go cup and microwave it this doesnt seem like that hard of a problem to solve commatoken nor can i imagine its the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot periodtoken again commatoken everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened periodtoken   this is a small thing commatoken but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board commatoken but then half of them apparently only come in one size i know its a small issue commatoken but youd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they dont have to keep telling people last time i was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me periodtoken   jersey java owners commatoken please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service periodtoken again commatoken they know their coffee commatoken and theyre generally nice until theres any sort of minor hiccup commatoken and then all basic common sense goes right out the window periodtoken your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time i go there periodtoken oh commatoken and buy more half and half periodtoken","915":"it was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendid like the homemade potato chips periodtoken

barbecue this will not be a place that i return to periodtoken its pricey for what it is and its just not that great periodtoken the service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome periodtoken but if youre looking for authentic barbecue at averagemarket price commatoken this isnt it periodtoken this is more of a barbecue style of their own and its pricey periodtoken it has a cool location commatoken and the service is friendly and prompt periodtoken","941":"slow periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot as amazing the last few times i have been periodtoken  the tomatoes are still excellent commatoken the fruit still the same commatoken and the ideas still fresh periodtoken  but sometimes there are a stale lettuce pieces in the salad commatoken and it can be like sitdownandreadabook times periodtoken still a great choice commatoken but i think the sheer traffic from the groupon or whatever with one or two staff only can lead me to not be quite as delighted as before periodtoken  still good as a local coffee place periodtoken","955":"look commatoken i like the place and featured donuts did not disappoint periodtoken  but lets be honest with a line like that commatoken how does a selfie happen  huh  st periodtoken louis  huh  strange donuts  i find that a little unusual and now my near perfect selfiefoursquare check in ratio has been irreconcilably tarnished so im taking a star off because selfie in the age of mark zuckerberg commatoken in the age of obama youre gonna have a shop too crowded to take a decent selfie  paleese periodtoken  also they have no paleogluten free options so another star off commatoken i mean what the hell am i supposed to feed my four and six year old","972":"if you want anything fresh commatoken you gotta come here early commatoken or else youre going to find yourself waiting for the pastries to bake or just have none at all periodtoken  im very bad with the names of pastries commatoken but i can say that i definitely like the guava turnover commatoken bearclaw commatoken almond croissant commatoken and ham and cheese croissant periodtoken  i wish they had more savoury pastries commatoken actually i wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit periodtoken   i had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning commatoken grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work periodtoken later on in the day i would grab a loaf of bread that i would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast periodtoken i wish the bakery was open later commatoken but unfortunately commatoken none of the bakeries in new orleans are open late commatoken and by late commatoken i mean past 1 or 2 pm periodtoken   that being said commatoken the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and i would give this place more stars if it wasnt for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers periodtoken i have been frequenting maple street patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions i have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient commatoken even when theres no one else in the store commatoken or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate periodtoken  at other times commatoken the workers are actually pretty nice periodtoken  so please commatoken if youre having a bad day commatoken dont take it out on the customers periodtoken  if you want coffee commatoken i would go across the street to starbucks or down the road to pjs commatoken but if you dont mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery periodtoken","978":"not bad periodtoken prices are very reasonable commatoken service is friendly periodtoken this place works like a subway you go in commatoken pick a size and start adding ingredients which you can see periodtoken sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than youd think commatoken based on just looking at them periodtoken that being said commatoken a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person commatoken and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl commatoken or seeking munchies elsewhere periodtoken","981":"the selection is pretty good periodtoken the prices are outrageous as one would expect periodtoken what i wasnt expecting was to see vegan jerky right at the entrance periodtoken how is that even possible better yet commatoken why would this place even try to sell that crap   they also have quite a few different fish options commatoken which also seems weird periodtoken salmon and swordfish are good soft periodtoken why dehydrate them  my biggest gripe is they dont offer samples periodtoken i get that jerky is expensive commatoken but theyd probably make it more enticing to buy if they let you try it periodtoken","990":"im really very impressed with the selection here periodtoken im not nearly as impressed with the price commatoken but where else can you get such a huge selection of foreign beer theres not just your usual belgians and germans either periodtoken i was happy to find japanese commatoken russian and even some lithuanian and polish bottles to choose from periodtoken there are even some quebec based brews you can find here du de ciel sticks out that i havent found elsewhere in the philly area periodtoken  ill be back just for the selection alone periodtoken you wont find anywhere with more inventory in the surrounding areas periodtoken ill cringe when i see the high price but try to remind myself its worth it periodtoken","998":"today i tried the red velvet and chocolate peppermint cupcakes periodtoken  frosting was very yummy however commatoken cake was rather

i loathe periodtoken the guy at the counter also looked super stressed out and annoyed even though there werent really a lot of people to deal with periodtoken id hate to see what hed be like during a

my three visits there commatoken i had the ten wings combo with fries and drink periodtoken the supposedly hot wings werent as spicy sorry guys ive had better periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the crinkle cut fries were alright as well periodtoken i did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate periodtoken which brings me to a point this is probably the first

was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster commatoken being quite pricey for what you get periodtoken  i have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b periodtokengood is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy commatoken depending on whos serving you though periodtoken and yes commatoken i know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as im concerned commatoken theres no reason why you should have to do online ordering for fast food periodtoken  as far as im concerned commatoken b periodtokengood is trying to market themselves as real fast food periodtoken the food is real commatoken but its definitely not fast commatoken and i dont know if

in good spirits while we waited forever to eat periodtoken when the food finally arrived everything was delicious periodtoken marcus recommended the johnny with fettuccine alfredo and it was excellent periodtoken my wife also enjoyed the johnny rocco salad periodtoken we would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is new

commatoken and somehow tasted better the day after periodtoken i liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant commatoken but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery periodtoken the ham and cheese croissant was delicious periodtoken the nutella croissant was okay good flavor but the croissant was hard and didnt have enough filling periodtoken the butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant periodtoken the almond croissant lacked flavor periodtoken  in the past commatoken ive ordered a green tea latte that i hated it just wasnt a flavor that fit my preferences and a mocha that was good periodtoken","1201":"there was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen commatoken eat some meatloaf and

periodtoken  the only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries periodtoken  it was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor commatoken just like char is supposed to taste periodtoken  their oysters are good if youre lucky enough to get there on a west coast day commatoken but even then commatoken they seem to get the small batches periodtoken   a real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters periodtoken  a real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that periodtoken   oh commatoken and who took the doughnuts  really  of all the dessert items commatoken you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce  for shame im hoping that as the winter rolls closer commatoken well see the meatloaf again commatoken with mushy peas commatoken and mashed potatoes like a good simple

minutes on the grill periodtoken  the truffle fries were very well flavored with truffle oil but were a little soggyunder cooked periodtoken  the place was very busy and they got the food out quickly but i would have waited another 5 minutes to correct the problems above periodtoken  also commatoken the floor was wet and very slippery periodtoken walk with caution periodtoken since it was the end of the night the place was a little dirty periodtoken the tables and floor could have been wiped down periodtoken","1473":"the donut selection today was not the best periodtoken after seeing all of their instagram posts commatoken i was looking for more a selection periodtoken they had 3 different ones that contained peanut butter and another 2 that had banana in it periodtoken i ended up getting the neapolitan commatoken which contained chocolate pudding inside and had strawberry powder on the outside periodtoken it was delicious commatoken but not worth the 4 in my opinion periodtoken","1478":"great concept commatoken decent healthy food commatoken but portions are off periodtoken i ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich minus the bun and had the veggies periodtoken while

could get a break periodtoken i do have to say the managers are great periodtoken the tall bearded wine guy is always helpful periodtoken and there is this one short guy thats always gathering grocery carts that will ask if you need help loading groceries periodtoken that is always nice","1513":"is it worth waiting in line for probably not periodtoken  lifechanging no periodtoken  but if theres no real wait commatoken and youve got nothing else planned that afternoon and can take the siesta necessary to digest all the carbs commatoken you should go periodtoken the sweet potato pancakes are really good commatoken but if youre looking for something less sweet commatoken more savory commatoken order the cornmeal cakes periodtoken if you want an omlet commatoken head next door to jacksons periodtoken","1514":"the salad was very good pizza was excellent the 805 keg blow during my pour and they didnt have a replacement but they were very accommodating and gave me a stella periodtoken

all commatoken i will say that ive only eaten from their hotfood island or whatever you call it once commatoken because it was so bland commatoken yet so expensive commatoken that i never wanted to try anything else they offer periodtoken having said that commatoken i must say that their seafood soups are quite tasty commatoken especially the lobster bisque commatoken but they are also so astronomically priced that i can rarely afford to indulge periodtoken the only time when i buy something at whole foods is when its on sale or from their bargain cheese bin which everyone should check out if they go here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken great deals periodtoken actually commatoken one star is just for the bargain cheese bin periodtoken without that commatoken it would definitely only get two periodtoken","1531":"i would love to give cyranos 4 stars but something really rubbed me the wrong way there on my last trip commatoken so i had to go for 3 periodtoken  more below

they dont cook it below medium well periodtoken wtf  seriously  i dont even remember the excuse but it was really lame periodtoken  he ordered it anyway and then wished he hadnt since it had no pink at all periodtoken  the fries were good commatoken but very mcdonaldslike periodtoken  the desserts were truly delicious periodtoken  my friend had a wonderful float made with abita root beer and i had the bread pudding commatoken which was so light and fluffy  really good     ill probably come back and update this review because the desserts can probably overcome the stupid burger policy periodtoken","1537":"yes commatoken remedy is home to my favourite chai commatoken has conveniently late hours commatoken and some mean vegan selections periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but thats about it periodtoken   this joint is crowded commatoken too loud to make conversation commatoken always has a dirty bathroom commatoken and theres nothing too particularly endearing and homie about it periodtoken  also a little overdone with people out on first dates commatoken which is indeed hilarious for peoplewatching periodtoken","1541":"reasons to go here 1 good location within other nearby stores 2 descent food compared to other inexpensive fast food restaurants in the area 3 staff seems friendly enough 4 seems clean  i have only been here once commatoken this experience may be an

had the best clam chowder in his life here periodtoken ohemgee he was right periodtoken best clam chowder ever periodtoken we also got the coconut shrimp and the shrimp ceviche periodtoken these plates were meh periodtoken the ceviche wasnt a true ceviche since the shrimp wasnt actually cooked in lime periodtoken it felt more like a salad periodtoken coconut shrimp was better but the accompanying fries and coleslaw was below average periodtoken","1569":"i like the ambiance and the decor of this coffee shop a lot but commatoken im not a big fan of their coffee drinks periodtoken the drinks themselves are very pretty commatoken they do some sort of art on top of the foam periodtoken but commatoken the taste is just alright periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i ordered a soy latte and it already came sweet periodtoken i dont like sugar or sweetness in my drinks and regularly a soy latte wouldnt come sweet unless i ask for syrup or add sugar periodtoken also commatoken their drinks arnt hot enough both mine and my boyfriends hot beverages were just slightly warm periodtoken im sure theyre fresh as i watched them make it but maybe they didnt steam the soy milk enough periodtoken","1587":"we went to baileys range to have dessert with friends we havent seen in years from different states periodtoken we came on a thurs night and there was plenty of space to sit commatoken but somewhat busy periodtoken we were a party of 11 with little ones periodtoken the hostess was super friendly at first and said she would get us a table right away but after we told her we were looking to have ice cream for dessert it took her close to 20 minutes and talking to the manager 2x to finally seat us at the empty very long community table periodtoken ice cream was average nothing special periodtoken the only saving grace of this experience was our waitress alexandra who was super attentive and friendly periodtoken if it wasnt for her i would give this place 1 star commatoken but because of her i would give this place another chance if im ever back in the area again periodtoken has potential if the hostess and manager can get customer service concept down or be forthright and tell us plainly they dont serve large parties just for dessert so we dont waste our time next time periodtoken","1588":"i recently came here again after i found out about the specials

sushi rolls did not taste good either but they didnt taste bad periodtoken  it was just enough to satisfy my sushi cravings as it had been a few quarters since i had it last periodtoken had the soft tofu soup but it did not taste like the kind my mom makes periodtoken    our server had a few questionable calls commatoken mainly when i asked for water and he came back with a refill for my brother periodtoken  the rest of us needed a refill but never got one periodtoken  its located about 50 mins from my house so chances are i will not return because of the distance and the fact i was not blown

high end ice cream periodtoken there is a yogurt shop and baskin robbins in the area also periodtoken","1598":"we went there for dinner on new years eve periodtoken  it was an early dinner 4pm because we walked down race street at 6pm to catch the early fireworks show periodtoken  we had a mixed generation family dinner and they were very accommodating as two family members were in wheelchairs

commatoken just a bit too much rice in it and the lamb souvlaki for lunch with a side of horta periodtoken  well executed food commatoken once it came out periodtoken however commatoken the service was horrid periodtoken i kept thinking gordon ramsey was in the back yelling oh come on because the entire commatoken full commatoken restaurant was getting no food from the kitchen periodtoken  its

coffee and took our orders right away periodtoken we waited over 30 mins for breakfast periodtoken i got the freebird and came out first before my husbands dish periodtoken while it tastes good commatoken it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce periodtoken there was barely any sausage periodtoken my husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami periodtoken lastly commatoken we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so i couldnt get our check periodtoken im not sure if we will return periodtoken","1653":"mediocre service at best commatoken pretty decent french food though periodtoken   upon arriving to the restaurant you are greeted by a large sign in the middle of the walkway that says please seat yourself periodtoken i typically have no issue with places that ask you to seat yourself commatoken in fact commatoken i rather enjoy picking my own seat periodtoken however commatoken i wasnt greeted by an actual person for 10 minutes after finding a seat periodtoken   when i was finally welcomed the person brought me water and took my order for coffee which she promptly returned with then told me someone would be along shortly to take my order periodtoken    periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken10 more minutes pass before a

to echo others concern for baileys slipping quality periodtoken i hope this goes beyond management to reach the attention of the ownership periodtoken ill preface by conveying that we did bring most of our concerns to the attention of management and were somewhat compensated periodtoken thats the only reason this isnt a 2 star review periodtoken  at 200ish on saturday afternoon with about 40 table occupancy commatoken it was about 1015 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server who got our drink order just 2 soft drinks periodtoken about 510 minutes later she came back and said she

i said i was glad my company was paying  i realized im getting a bit long winded so periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  skip the gluten free bun and go breadless commatoken its poor tasting and falls apart periodtoken  the pretzels are balls of sweet dough that taste like they were previously frozen and defrosted  the good news and bad news on the caesar salad croutons were that they good seemed housemade bad were badly overtoasted periodtoken  i thought the 5 fries we received were the 3 fries based on the quantity and the table consensus was they could have been a bit crispierfresher periodtoken  the manager only took off the 1 gluten free bun upgrade and the pretzels periodtoken he was apologetic and blamed it on being understaffed periodtoken   it didnt seem to be a staffing issue but that everyone from host team to servers were just a bit too laid back about their jobs to help their guests the way a 20 per guest restaurant should be periodtoken","1669":"oh how i want to like baileys range more  the good they have a community table dinner once a month where they have guest chefs come in and create a buffet different each month periodtoken  it costs 20 all you care to

brilliant combo of bourbon commatoken candied bacon commatoken and salted caramel ice cream periodtoken  mmmmm periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengood periodtoken  the not so good the gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired periodtoken  very dense commatoken heavy and super crumbly periodtoken  i admire the desire to make things in house but there are way

commatoken its okay periodtoken its a nice enough place with decent enough coffee periodtoken i went more than once during my trip periodtoken  if this is the best new orleans has to offer however i am afraid to see what the other places look like periodtoken inventive vegan and gluten free options on the shelf with the baked goods that said  no need to cross the street for the vegan empanada

the restaurant from my past experience periodtoken i have to say i was disappointed with my entree  on this visit periodtoken  i had the grilled mahi mahi commatoken usually my fave fish periodtoken the mahi had no flavor commatoken was very bland commatoken and a sort of fishy taste periodtoken the side of capellini pasta was equally disappointing periodtoken the marinara sauce tasted like pure tomato sauce out of the can periodtoken   the other entrees at the table were veal montalbano and chicken pontchartrain periodtoken the guests liked their entrees commatoken so maybe i chose the wrong dish commatoken but i dont think i will be back for awhile periodtoken","1757":"the smoothies and bowls there are good periodtoken i have already been back periodtoken it was just that i wanted a larger smoothie size periodtoken its just a suggestion to management periodtoken i dont get smoothies from any places that add sugar or artificial ingredients periodtoken so commatoken understand that

visiting family and wanted to take them out for dinner at a greek restaurant commatoken this was a different one than we had went prior when visiting in tarpon springs periodtoken  the place is what americans think greek is  alot of white and blue  we were seated against the window facing the street commatoken so i like our location of seating  out of the traffic area periodtoken  ordered dolmades and a greek salad for all to share commatoken both were good periodtoken  the gyro one had was a bit dry commatoken fried grouper sandwich was good commatoken the lamb shank wspagetti was different however the lamb didnt fall off the bone could be the method of cooking compared to other shanks that i have had commatoken and the stuffed grouper with crab was good periodtoken  cant say compared to other greek restaurants that it would be my pick to drive out of the way for however it was ok periodtoken  found some of the desserts that were picked up for later way over the top with sugar  havent had anything this sweet at anyother greek restaurants  bakery i have been too periodtoken","1762":"nice creamy product with unusual flavors but the prices are pretty high if you are

a generous portion of hashbrowns and toast periodtoken  throw in coffee and our bill total was only 15  food was good commatoken served piping hot and service was friendly periodtoken  i had the western omelet and my buddy had the farmers periodtoken  we came in 30 minutes before closing but they did not rush us out at all periodtoken  plenty of street parking nearby periodtoken  typical diner atmosphere with counter seating commatoken tables and booths periodtoken  seems like they can fit in a decent crowd on a busy weekend morning periodtoken  not exactly around the korner from me but worth another visit if we are in lansdale again periodtoken","1769":"this review is based off of one visit as i dont think i will be returning anytime soon periodtoken   i was attending a christmas get together at besito with a large group of about 16 periodtoken i ordered a frozen margarita periodtoken it was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate periodtoken it was okay commatoken but a little off for my tastes periodtoken it was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving periodtoken i only finished about half of it periodtoken we ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be 5 instead of the usual 9 periodtoken we had to ask for the happy hour price commatoken but more on that in a moment periodtoken   three of us decided to split a queso fundito periodtoken this is one of my favorite mexican appetizers and i order it regularly at traditional mexican restaurants periodtoken while the queso fundito was still good at besito commatoken it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version periodtoken it is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas periodtoken besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers periodtoken it was also served in a very shallow square skillet periodtoken when split three ways and with the 23 others in the room that tried it commatoken it left very little queso fundito periodtoken the flavor was good periodtoken however commatoken with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity commatoken i would not order again periodtoken   i was able to try the chips commatoken salsa and table side guacamole also periodtoken i will say that this is probably the best guacamole that i have ever tried periodtoken i loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado periodtoken the salsa and guac were my favorite things at besito periodtoken however commatoken i cant see myself paying 10 for guac on a return visit periodtoken that is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion periodtoken   for my meal commatoken i ordered the chile rellenos con hongos periodtoken i order rellenos anytime i see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things periodtoken most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side periodtoken lets face it periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenstuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world periodtoken my rellenos did not come with a side periodtoken the came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping 18 periodtoken i almost didnt order them when i saw the price commatoken but everything else on the menu was that price or higher periodtoken the rellenos had good flavor for the first bite periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenor maybe two periodtoken however commatoken a few bites in i was over it periodtoken they are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside periodtoken so much freaking goat cheese periodtoken i like the stuff commatoken but it was overboard periodtoken that wasnt the worst part though commatoken it was the pine nuts periodtoken there seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate periodtoken i would never order this again periodtoken   our service was great until it came time for the checks periodtoken our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up periodtoken she also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks periodtoken however commatoken the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope periodtoken when they returned commatoken my card was with my friends check and had been charged and my check was missing periodtoken wth it ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks commatoken get them corrected commatoken get them corrected again and get out of

place periodtoken i like to bring people from out of town because they get good food and get to try beer they wouldnt otherwise periodtoken parking is tricky though periodtoken  dont come on a sunday night though periodtoken i think its just because no one was around commatoken but the cheese in the cheeseburger was frozen solid periodtoken not pleasant periodtoken otherwise commatoken the beer was good and so was the food periodtoken  pros good beer commatoken good food commatoken interesting place to see cons parking can be annoying commatoken sunday night servicefood is the opposite of busier times periodtoken","1783":"located in the suburbs commatoken morning call serves beignets just like its rival cafe du monde periodtoken its more of a lower key place definitely less touristy periodtoken you will find more local patrons rather than tourists dwelling here periodtoken it is also opened 247 periodtoken i was told it has been opened almost as long as cafe du monde and that its original location use to be down the street from them periodtoken its a nice change of pace from the rush you get from the french quarters periodtoken  the beignets here contain a bit more dough and are definitely thicker periodtoken they dont automatically dump the powdered sugar for you periodtoken they have it on each table and you do it yourself periodtoken  the prices here are about the same as their competitors periodtoken its more of a chilled out spot periodtoken the people here are leisurely browsing their laptops commatoken newspaper commatoken and just conversing in their own world periodtoken  if you want to avoid the mayhem at the other beignet spot commatoken then come here or if youre in the area periodtoken its much more relaxed but youll notice a difference in taste and texture which also includes the cafe au lait periodtoken","1793":"i dont know why i had such high expectations of this farmers market commatoken but i did periodtoken  i guess i thought it would be similar to those i find at the beach cities of san diego periodtoken  i was a little shocked at how small it was periodtoken  it is one of the bigger farmers markets that i have been to commatoken but i guess i still had those expectations periodtoken  the location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing periodtoken  however commatoken i wasnt a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market periodtoken  in terms of the vendors commatoken they have the typical fruits and veggies commatoken eggs commatoken meat commatoken flowers commatoken etc periodtoken  i was a fan of this pie that i was given a sample of on my way out of the market periodtoken","1818":"so after coming here several times and after the thrill of the newness is over commatoken i can review this honestly periodtoken   this place is overrated periodtoken their food is overpriced compared to other healthy food places periodtoken even with the sales it is sometimes not even worth it periodtoken the produce also gets old quickly and i can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less periodtoken i do browse the sale options and i come sometimes for that after i compare them to other stores periodtoken   the salad bar prepared meals are meh periodtoken actually disappointing periodtoken i always end up driving to whole foods  every time i try to do my grocery shopping here i always end up having to go to other stores to find what i need for the week periodtoken i cant say that i have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like i got the best deal periodtoken   the only time i come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors periodtoken i dont hate it but its just not the first place i would come to or think to do my full grocery shopping periodtoken the staff is really nice though periodtoken  i wanted to like this place more but it just isnt doing it for me","1820":"came here to grab a couple of beers on a thursday night periodtoken  it was surprisingly busy commatoken given that the place just opened periodtoken  supposedly this is a side project from the folks at farmers cabinet and you can tell based on the lighting or lack thereof periodtoken  thank god the hostess led us up the stairs because i couldnt see a damn thing  but enough of my whining periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlets get back to the important stuff periodtoken    there are 24 taps downstairs and then they keep the 12 local taps at the upstairs bar periodtoken  i was pleased with the engine 1892 market stout from philadelphia brewing company commatoken which was a recommendation from the bartender commatoken rocco periodtoken  he clearly knew his beers commatoken but was also able to recommendsuccessfully make some cocktails for my friends periodtoken  he was also very personable periodtoken  the food menu looked really good commatoken but it was under the coming soon section commatoken so i was unsure if it was actually available last night periodtoken  i was intrigued by the turnip kimchi that apparently comes on their hot dogs periodtoken  ill definitely be back to try that and will update my yelp review accordingly periodtoken    to summarize commatoken a great place for beer aficionados periodtoken  and vampires periodtoken  im torn between giving 3 and 4 stars commatoken but i figure i can always go up once i try their food","1823":"if you are looking for the classic small cramp sushi place commatoken then this is the place for you periodtoken the service is lack luster commatoken but the food makes up for the poor table management and not so smart waiters periodtoken","1827":"not sure how to review this place fairly periodtoken the effort on the part of the owners is top notchlove how the order process follows you to the table so any follow up dishes you might want dont require waiting in the front line again periodtoken however commatoken the culinary execution failed somehow commatoken or at least it fell strangely flat periodtoken while all the food we had beef souvlaki commatoken lamb pita commatoken and grilled octopus was decent commatoken it definitely wasnt transcendent periodtoken it was just food periodtoken also commatoken the ubiquitous french fries were only semiaddictive as were a  little dry periodtoken   while this is maybe the best greek food in nashville commatoken that in itself doesnt warrant 5 stars periodtoken what we concluded after eating all the food was commatoken while greko was okay there was nothing that we had that would draw us back periodtoken","1835":"ate dinner at pinocchios periodtoken  it was ok periodtoken  service was good and they refunded us the price of the shrimp because we thought the shrimp tasted a little too fishy periodtoken  i had the lite plate periodtoken  it was ok

good he ate it all periodtoken   the drinks were ok periodtoken  we had a coronarita commatoken call it a turborita commatoken  and a top shelf bloody mary periodtoken prices are middle of the road

and the waitress was very forgetful and basically sucked periodtoken we brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and i am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it commatoken the bottle was returned with 16th left and we only had two pitchers and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left periodtoken good food commatoken poor service","1861":"as a big fan of baileys chocolate bar their tiramisu martini is my favorite drink ever commatoken i really really wanted to love this place too commatoken but i just didnt periodtoken  i had a cheeseburger commatoken fries with their cheese sauce commatoken and a peanut butter milkshake periodtoken  the burger was okay commatoken and i probably wouldve liked it better had i not put their homemade ketchup on it before tasting it periodtoken  im not sure what is up with their ketchup commatoken but i just didnt really care for it periodtoken  too sweet commatoken perhaps  it just didnt taste quite right to me periodtoken the fries were good commatoken as was their cheese sauce periodtoken  and the peanut butter shake was amazing periodtoken  i did try some of my husbands food and i guess thats partially why i only am giving baileys range 3 stars periodtoken he ordered honey mustard sauce with his fries commatoken and there was nothing honey flavored about it it just tasted like spicy mustard to me commatoken which neither of us particularly care for periodtoken  i wont even get started on the bacon milkshake he ordered and didnt care for commatoken because thats his own fault for ordering something so strange periodtoken  in short commatoken i wasnt all that impressed periodtoken  if i ever go again commatoken maybe ill stick with the dessert and skip the food  either that commatoken or bring my own condiments","1864":"tucked on 76 ave is a small cozy cafe commatoken usually filled with local students because there arent too many parking spots periodtoken the prices at this cafe are a bit higher than that of remedy commatoken and the seating arrangements are tight periodtoken there are large comfy seats and more table seating periodtoken it is convenient and quite accessible to the neighborhood commatoken although higher prices will incur periodtoken ambient noise would be higher due to the smaller space periodtoken  mosaic cafe is very similar commatoken however space and table seating are also an issue periodtoken","1876":"this is a decent mediterranean place periodtoken  the food was nothing special honestly your run of the mill mediterranean food periodtoken   the area is

of this place periodtoken they also have a good variety of drinks and food depending on what you are looking for periodtoken  however commatoken every time ive been here commatoken the service has left a lot to be desired and caused me to leave earlier than i would have periodtoken    i had a flight of wine and was planning on getting some food and another drink periodtoken but after the initial delivery of my flight commatoken no one checked in with me for the next 45 minutes periodtoken   i had even mentioned i was thinking about food periodtoken  this is the second time ive had this sort of experience here periodtoken  hopefully it improves periodtoken","1948":"i hit the drivethru at this white castle last night with my aunt on our way home from carmel periodtoken i was starving and it hit the spot periodtoken   our order was taken right away and in a friendly manner periodtoken the food seemed to take several minutes commatoken but was hot and fresh and worth the wait periodtoken it was my first time trying the new veggie sliders periodtoken they arent the best veggie burgers i have ever had commatoken and are quite high in calories from what i hear commatoken but were good periodtoken i appreciate that white castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat periodtoken  the only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce commatoken what kind of sauce i do not know commatoken i requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off periodtoken there also were no napkins or salt in the bag periodtoken it was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunts fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car periodtoken the large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein periodtoken  service was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean periodtoken it appears to be either a newer store or a very wellkept one periodtoken bonus was seeing one of the indy chicken limos down the road periodtoken  updating to say commatoken while good tasting commatoken the food i had did not sit quite right with me periodtoken  it was possibly that im not used to greasy combined with being out of sorts lately periodtoken tastes good commatoken but i may need antacid or something next time periodtoken","1952":"the right place for the best authentictasting ny bagels periodtoken the wrong place if youre looking for a smile periodtoken","1954":"this was a fun place with friendly and fun bartenders periodtoken  the food was pretty good too periodtoken","1956":"this is my usual commatoken but only because my neighborhood has no grocery store commatoken even though its been 5 12 years since katrina periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   anyway commatoken the parking lot is a freaking death trap periodtoken people park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking periodtoken a lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for a lot of people periodtoken the produce is unreliable commatoken except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce commatoken which i love commatoken and use to buy as locally as possible periodtoken all other rouses dont have this commatoken but they should periodtoken a few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are commatoken etc periodtoken   the bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day commatoken and most of it is really tasty periodtoken warning commatoken though commatoken they dont list the nutritional information on the packages commatoken so you might get something you dont want in your tummy periodtoken periodtoken  theyve recently added a natural section commatoken which has organic and all natural foodbeauty products periodtoken this makes me very happy commatoken but i usually buy the rouses brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper periodtoken    as i mentioned earlier commatoken this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people periodtoken what that means to you is that on busy times at like commatoken 6 pm commatoken or right before saints games periodtoken periodtoken commatoken it is so busy that you cant go in an aisle without smashing into someone commatoken and it gets really frustrating periodtoken i try to go on off times and pray for the day when they reopen the store on elysian fields periodtoken","1960":"decent food commatoken decent amounts periodtoken just order a few different plates and share with the others at the table periodtoken","1981":"ahh commatoken my not so secret  love affair with cupcakes deepens with my experience at jimmies cupcake truck periodtoken stopping at one i would love to see you try my darling periodtoken   the day i came upon this truck i was all about some cupcakes and they had a pretty amazing variety periodtoken i was torn but not for long periodtoken i started at their james bond red velvet cupcake and was immersed in a moist and creamy cupcake heaven periodtoken just the right amount of sweetness for the frosting and the cupcakes were not too dense and not too light periodtoken it was perfection periodtoken i took out the cookies and cream cupcake next periodtoken the little oreo cookies in the cupcake batter periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengenius periodtoken the frosting tasted just like oreo filling and i was taken back to my childhood periodtoken i finished off with a menue special  apple cake cupcake periodtoken it was buttery commatoken cinnomony what and all the things that taste like fall periodtoken hallelujah   my only regret that day was that i could not eat any more periodtoken","1988":"the filet mignon is good periodtoken always cooked well when i order it periodtoken the banana foster is also very yummy periodtoken they cook it table side periodtoken overall commatoken not a bad place periodtoken","1989":"i had a large party reservation 10 people for 830 on a friday night periodtoken i made the reservation a week in advance and was told it was no problem periodtoken we didnt get seated until 915 periodtoken the hostess kept telling us that they were waiting to get tables together commatoken im not sure what she meant by that but it was annoying to have 10 people standing around waiting for a table for 45 minutes periodtoken   we waited at the bar and had some margaritas periodtoken the first one we tried commatoken the natural one commatoken tasted watered down periodtoken the bartender then informed us it had water in it periodtoken who puts water in a margarita we tried the classic next commatoken it was better but not great periodtoken the ingredients listed next to the margaritas on the menu are not accurate so be sure to ask the bartender exactly whats in each one periodtoken   once we were seated our waiter was extremely nice and did a great job with such a large party we had 3 orders of the table side guacamole and they were delicious periodtoken for dinner commatoken most of us orders appetizer portions because we had filled up on the guac and all the free chips and salsa periodtoken my tacos were okay commatoken they came on corn tortillas and i should have asked for flour ones but the carne asada was delicious periodtoken i asked for no cilantro but it was on there periodtoken i didnt want to send it back because it was already 1030 and i was just so hungry at that point periodtoken  not sure ill be back commatoken there are a lot better mexican places in tampa but you have to try everything at least once","1991":"food tastes ok however commatokengiven the price commatoken they give you stingy amount of meat periodtoken  despite the ownerwaitress friendly service commatoken i still left feeling ripped off periodtoken","1997":"food good but music so loud its hard to hear youre friends talking periodtoken also its a bit of mayhem when you have to wait in line to order and pay periodtoken cuban sandwich is delish periodtoken","2007":"love the food been bringing the fam here for years periodtoken recently commatoken the service has gotten very slow compared to years past  some of the servers have a sulky attitude periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensad periodtoken good news is their other location is just do n the road periodtoken","2038":"a great little caf\u00e9 the salads and sandwiches are very good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i suggest trying the city hall commatoken a jalape\u00f1o pimento cheese and bacon panini very friendly and helpful staff great place","2061":"tasty food periodtoken slightly marked up with prices but thats to be expected since it is on stearns wharf periodtoken long wait","2076":"a decent coffeehouse with lots of seats  tables for working commatoken but theres no wifi commatoken which makes it kind of a useless cafe if you want to do work periodtoken both of the green teas sold here were very refreshing though periodtoken","2079":"very tasty commatoken filling meals periodtoken  oversized desserts which is good periodtoken  very attentive staff periodtoken  lousy coffee commatoken though periodtoken","2085":"went with a large group and the service was decent periodtoken i ordered the swedish pancakes but the waitress gave me the wrong one periodtoken i didnt realize it until another person who ordered swedish pancakes got theirs periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken which looks way different than mine periodtoken  they mistakenly gave me blueberry pancakes periodtoken  it was too late to argue because i was already half way done eating it periodtoken  i was hungry periodtoken  overall commatoken the food tasted average periodtoken  not really worth waiting in line periodtoken  i would recommend other diners if u dont want to wait in line periodtoken","2086":"so i definitely much prefer the feel of the tasting room in kessler but if you want the full upland menu you have to come here periodtoken everything was good i had the seitan tenderloin which i always have liked and this was no different commatoken and an ard ri to drink also delicious as always periodtoken   the bar seating is really tight but there are plenty of tables and a surprising amount of families periodtoken also a general comment commatoken i went with someone who is full on gluten free celiac figuring with their amount of veg friendly they would also be gf friendly periodtoken but she struggled to find something to eat commatoken and items were not identified on the menu this is not specific to this location but some options may be a good idea for these folks periodtoken","2094":"i stopped here because it was on the way back from my dads house commatoken its not one of my usual places commatoken but i figured why not  i generally stop here maybe a few times a year commatoken usually after visits to my dad periodtoken i realized why that is the case periodtoken there are better snowballs in new orleans periodtoken  thats not to say this place is horrible periodtoken ive had better and ive had worse periodtoken that earns three stars from me periodtoken  i got the jumbo size as i always do periodtoken they didnt quite put enough syrup in it commatoken i saw a chunk of white ice where they missed a spot periodtoken i prefer a lot of syrup periodtoken  the other thing that turned me off was their setup periodtoken they have bars on their windows and they keep them shut except for when taking your order and giving you your snowball periodtoken the window that they hand you your snowball is completely covered with newspaper articles so you cant watch your snowball made periodtoken then theres a sign saying commatoken please dont knock on the window periodtoken so its like you cant check on your order if its taking too long periodtoken  maybe theyve been robbed there before or something but when im there i feel like im in a bank in a high crime area periodtoken","2103":"the food was great commatoken good enough that i will return commatoken but the service was well periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken interesting periodtoken our server was too friendly periodtoken coming over often just to start conversation with us and even sitting down with us towards the end of the meal to talk to us periodtoken i appreciate friendly service commatoken but this was a little too much periodtoken i however got the bison burger and it was wonderful commatoken and the beer was great too","2119":"i was surprisingly not pleased about maynards after reading all the decent reviews i expected a lot more periodtoken i dont live in tucson but my girlfriend does and i only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when i do make it up to tucson periodtoken wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked maynards periodtoken   arriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasnt the restaurants fault as downtown tucson is undergoing some major improvements periodtoken once we got inside the hostess was nice periodtoken we sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us periodtoken   we both were really excited and hungry for a good meal commatoken the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard commatoken the service was not the best commatoken our waiter was slow and didnt seem very busy even though it was friday night periodtoken   i ordered the burger and my girlfriend had the filet mignon periodtoken the food made it out decently timed commatoken but i was unhappy when i took a bite into my burger i ordered it medium and it was burnt to the crisp commatoken way past over done and had no color commatoken just burnt black periodtoken for a 20 dollar burger it was not what i expected had no flavor whatsoever periodtoken but the bacon i bought for an extra 2 periodtoken00 on the burger was really good so thats a positive periodtoken   now for the positives commatoken the bacon was really good commatoken the size of the burger was perfect periodtoken and the french fries on the side were amazing periodtoken   my girlfriend loved her steak and i took a bite and it was really good so i was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well periodtoken  overall it wasnt that bad of an experience and i would dine there again commatoken my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good commatoken might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasnt feeling on his burger game that night periodtoken if we were to go again and i am sure we will i would definitely not be getting the burger and focus on there steak which was really good periodtoken","2126":"i echo the same sentiment that if you havent really had any type of gourmet donut commatoken you will love these periodtoken i think the flavors are interesting and creative commatoken but the actual dough is bland and made without sugar periodtoken if you get the donuts commatoken get the extra fancy which are cream filled and usually tastier periodtoken i will say that their sandwiches and burgers are really good flavored just right commatoken good ingredients periodtoken","2134":"be sure to ask for a written receipt and check it closely periodtoken  i didnt get gone one and am pretty sure i was overcharged during happy hour periodtoken","2135":"i came here for my birthday as mentioned by aria s periodtoken i made reservations for a wed night for a group of 9 this is their max periodtoken good thing too commatoken because every table was full periodtoken since this is a byob commatoken we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table periodtoken as i looked around commatoken every other table had ice for their wine periodtoken i had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table periodtoken he took our wine and put it over on a window sill periodtoken this was a little strange commatoken but it only got worse periodtoken we didnt know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us periodtoken we spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine periodtoken not exactly how i wanted to spend my bday dinner periodtoken its especially frustrating because this is a byob restaurant commatoken youd think this wouldnt have been an issue periodtoken besides this commatoken the service was fine periodtoken they also accommodate to the gluten free people out there periodtoken  onto the food periodtoken we started with dips of the day commatoken very authentic and tasty periodtoken i ordered the braised rabbit leg periodtoken i thought the meat itself was fine periodtoken i wish it was seasoned better and more tender commatoken especially for 26 periodtoken luckily i was able to try a few of my friends dishes periodtoken my favorite was the stuffed pepper periodtoken i really wish i ordered that instead periodtoken   unfortunately i will not be coming back here periodtoken i wish i was able to have a great experience like some of the people below periodtoken","2160":"i had a great salad here periodtoken  wipe visions of wimpy commatoken unsatisfying fare from your mind periodtoken  it was a loaded bowl commatoken with nothing but healthy toppings periodtoken  really no atmosphere to speak of periodtoken  get in commatoken eat commatoken get out periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the dude that helped me was unpolite periodtoken  he rolled his eyes the whole time commatoken then informed me the salad i was choosing was too much food commatoken and made fun of the fact i couldnt pronounce anything correctly periodtoken  every time i picked a topping commatoken he questioned me about it periodtoken  what a jerk","2176":"the food is okay the rice under the sushi seems hard sometimes periodtoken the hot pots are pretty good though periodtoken the shabu shabu is what i come for overall its good commatoken but not great","2184":"so after a 30 minute plus wait for saturday brunch i was excited just to sit down periodtoken they had water at the table and two glasses filled commatoken luke warm tap water periodtoken so lets just

honey roasted ham commatoken mascarpone and pineapple i couldnt wait to dig in periodtoken my boyfriend ordered salmon beni and it looked fabulous periodtoken just as i took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food periodtoken needless to say we were done commatoken however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants periodtoken  they were very apologetic about the incident periodtoken  i think ill probably go back again but not sure i could convince my man to periodtoken","2191":"had dinner with three family members periodtoken lovely evening on the deck periodtoken  service was fine as always periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the veal parm i ordered wasnt periodtoken  it was dry and tasteless periodtoken to be fair my table mates enjoyed their dinners periodtoken  drinks were good as was our dessert a profiterole periodtoken   but i cant help the thought that something as straightforward and usual as veal parm should be great every time at a good restaurant specializing in italian food periodtoken","2207":"we were in from out of town and went here due to the reviews and awesome looking pastries periodtoken we waited about an hour to be seated periodtoken there were times when quite a few tables were open at a time periodtoken now commatoken ive been a waitress before and am aware that you dont want to be double or triple seated periodtoken but commatoken if it was that bad maybe more staffwaiters would have helped periodtoken our waitress on the other hand was nice but seemed to be very overwhelmed periodtoken we were asked three times of we wanted anything to drink periodtoken we ordered the poutine fries and the egg breakfast commatoken as well as one of the doughnutcroissant in the peanut butter churro flavor periodtoken the poutine fries were really good my husband enjoyed them periodtoken the egg breakfast was good too bacon was crispy and thick my favorite periodtoken my eggs came out over easy when i asked for over hard periodtoken oh well periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the pastry was good commatoken not the best periodtoken we did wait a while for the food and for the check so the waitress was nice enough to bring a pastry for free periodtoken we took it to go and it was good periodtoken but i will say the next time we visit tucson we probably wont be stopping by periodtoken","2217":"went there for first time and had a buffet which for price is not bad considering the quantity of items served but quality wise its not good at all in my opinion periodtoken i tried everything but really didnt like anything and specially i was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible periodtoken im giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely periodtoken the restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved periodtoken sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve periodtoken good luck","2224":"tasty periodtoken  we ordered 5 different dishes and 3 different apps periodtoken  scallion pancakes were delicious periodtoken  the garlic beef was very good periodtoken  my oldest who likes fish commatoken ordered fish in pickled chili periodtoken  it was good but fried fish in a soggy sauce was mediocre periodtoken  food came out fast but service was very good periodtoken  home style tofu was very good but clashed with other dishes periodtoken","2231":"3 stars for food commatoken 4 stars for service periodtoken  when we walked in commatoken we were greeted by friendly commatoken welcoming staff periodtoken  they gave us menus and answered any questions periodtoken  we ordered and sat outside periodtoken  the inside has only has a few tables and there are a few wooden picnic

sangria and it was very average periodtoken the food came out super fast periodtoken  i had a bowl that had shrimp commatoken rice commatoken beans commatoken guacamole commatoken salsa commatoken and queso fresco periodtoken  nothing to write home about periodtoken  it came with a side of tortillas and those were delicious actually the best part of the meal periodtoken  the bowl reminded me exactly of chipotle commatoken but i think chipotle might actually be a little stronger periodtoken  my husband had tacos periodtoken  again commatoken nothing special periodtoken  i do feel the tacos were a bit over priced 3 periodtoken50 for what you were getting periodtoken  taco bus tacos cost the same commatoken but the taste is head and shoulders above periodtoken  the food was fresh commatoken but it was just missing something periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken would not return with the amount of other authentic mexican options in the area periodtoken","2235":"this review is only for the donuts and coffee periodtoken i selected the almond joy donut and iced vanilla latte periodtoken we came here based on all the reviews on yelp and it could have been a miss due to the donut offerings of that day 8 varieties 4 specialties such as neapolitan commatoken late night snack commatoken etc and 4 somewhat normal selections such as glaze commatoken cinnamon roll commatoken etc periodtoken i was looking for the vietnamese coffee flavor or blueberry flavored donut but they didnt have either periodtoken   the almond joy donut was a disappointment periodtoken it tasted like any other donut ive tasted before periodtoken i was looking for more of a coconut and almond taste periodtoken the iced vanilla latte was okay as well periodtoken","2247":"natural cafe is one of the best restaurants for vegetarians periodtoken  their buddha burritos and falafel pitas are among my favorites periodtoken their new location at camino real marketplace is great too commatoken  although the older one at old town was more classic periodtoken    the reason i gave 3 stars instead of a 4 periodtoken5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have periodtoken  first commatoken  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts periodtoken  i find this very silly periodtoken  the name of the restaurant is natural cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment periodtoken  but its strange that they need a paper printout and dont allow if we show them the email in the phone periodtoken   second commatoken  they are also very strict with timings periodtoken  if you come around the closing time 9 pm commatoken they just keep showing at the table to get you out periodtoken  the older place at old town was more relaxed with the timings periodtoken   i would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules periodtoken  the food here is still one of the best periodtoken","2257":"i was all too underwhelmed by pre and pastry periodtoken my amazing fianc\u00e9e and i went there for breakfast one day with high expectations i love a good breakfast and am a picky eater periodtoken i understand that not everywhere has something i love commatoken but i remained hopeful the inside is darling and has a promising ambiance periodtoken we were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable periodtoken once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey periodtoken our server was an awkward girl who wouldnt look us in the eyes periodtoken  i ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fianc\u00e9e had duck fat gravy with biscuits periodtoken my meal had little to no flavor and i ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something periodtoken my fianc\u00e9e said his meal had no flavor and was greasey periodtoken  maybe if we ordered differently commatoken we could really like the place commatoken but we are turned off by it now periodtoken if you go commatoken do not get the sweet potato hash","2274":"popped in for allday breakfast recently  realized its a very limited breakfast menu periodtoken wish it was the full menu all day the manager was very helpful  attentive periodtoken the other employees werent great periodtoken the main dining area was clean  tidy but the side area was messy  not very clean periodtoken my food came out hot  fresh though commatoken so im happy about that","2276":"im giving bottleworks three stars based upon the diningfood experience  particularly what you get for the money you have to spend there periodtoken my rating is not based upon their barbeer and general environment as a whole periodtoken  i like schlafly bottleworks as a barpatio spot and i appreciate schlaflys approach in general periodtoken they host some great events commatoken have a really nice space commatoken good beer commatoken and have friendly service periodtoken but that said commatoken the food has not been great for me here periodtoken  in my past two visits ive tried something pricey and then something cheap periodtoken hohum on both periodtoken first  the pricey dish commatoken which was the pretzel encrusted chicken periodtoken schlafly is not the least bit shy charging 1519 for their entrees commatoken and this one is 18 periodtoken the chicken was a decent portion commatoken i suppose periodtoken but it was a tad dry overall periodtoken flavor just ok periodtoken the mashed potatoes which come with it were good periodtoken but for 18 i better be full and happy commatoken plain and simple periodtoken  then last night i was really hungry and went for the bottleworks burger periodtoken this was definitely a disappointment periodtoken i ordered it medium commatoken it came out pretty much welldone periodtoken that i could tolerate if it were either a periodtoken juicy or b periodtoken flavorful periodtoken i got neither here periodtoken the potato wedges were awesome commatoken however periodtoken  now commatoken i saw someone order the bison meatball spaghetti and that looked huge and appetizing periodtoken   i do love the bar and patio here commatoken and they often get in some good live music periodtoken but unfortunately the food prices for what you get are just a bit suspect to me periodtoken","2281":"time out new york named this one of the top 20 italian restaurants in the u periodtokens periodtoken it was the only restaurant on their list not located in a major food city nyc commatoken chicago commatoken etc periodtoken and as it happened commatoken its a 5minute drive from my home periodtoken i figured i had to try it periodtoken  the restaurant itself is the size of a postage stamp commatoken with maybe 10 tables periodtoken youre not getting in without reservations commatoken so if youre interested in eating here commatoken make sure you call ahead periodtoken  would i call this one of the best italian restaurants in the country frankly commatoken no periodtoken that doesnt mean its not good periodtoken but dining out is about more than just the food commatoken and this is the area i feel is lacking periodtoken im not talking about the servers commatoken who were friendly and knowledgeable periodtoken due to the size restrictions and the fact that the restaurant is almost completely woodfurnished commatoken the noise level is insane periodtoken i know they are going for that sicilian trattoria feel commatoken but some noisecancelling measures like curtains or plants could have been helpful periodtoken it was almost impossible to carry a conversation with my dining companions without screaming periodtoken   the food the menu is set up for a traditional italian threecourse meal of salad commatoken pasta commatoken and entree periodtoken my friend and i started with the antipasto for two and the panzanella bread salad periodtoken the bread salad  topped with capers commatoken white anchovies commatoken and wonderful if outofseason tomatoes  was a winner periodtoken the antipasto was a mixed bag periodtoken some items the charred broccoli commatoken housecured beets commatoken and tuna with white beans were amazing periodtoken others the carrots commatoken cauliflower commatoken potatoes commatoken and cheeses were surprisingly bland periodtoken  for my pasta course commatoken i had the housemade tagliatelli with lemon sauce commatoken topped with bottarga tuna roe periodtoken the pasta was well made perfect consistency commatoken the sauce was decent it had a nice spice commatoken but the lemon was a little overwhelming  and i say that as someone who loves citrus periodtoken i am not sure that the saltiness of the bottarga was the perfect complement to this dish commatoken either periodtoken  i had the rabbit for my entree periodtoken it was excellent falloffthebone tender and served in a great sauce periodtoken i was a bit disappointed commatoken though commatoken that it was served with just a few unremarkable potatoes as the garnish periodtoken the server had mentioned that the dishes were proteinheavy commatoken but even so commatoken i wanted something a little more exciting on the side periodtoken my friend is vegetarian and thus opted for pasta as her main course periodtoken she sampled the spinach and ricotta gnocchi commatoken which were quite nice periodtoken  desserts were a homemade ice cream sandwich of sorts with pistachio gelato excellent and a lemon tart good but not mindblowing periodtoken","2289":"good food and for a chain very good food periodtoken it lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food periodtoken i give it three stars instead of four mainly because its probably not on my top 10 places in reno for mexican food periodtoken chipotle is not even my favorite mexicanthemed chain restaurant periodtoken that would be el pollo loco periodtoken for my meal i got a burrito with beef commatoken black beans commatoken white rice commatoken sour cream commatoken cheese commatoken lettuce and maybe some other stuff periodtoken i added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce periodtoken i had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times i came periodtoken the staff was friendly when i placed my order periodtoken i got my burrito commatoken chips and salsa when i paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later periodtoken chipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food periodtoken the chips are good quality chips periodtoken the salsa tastes mass produced periodtoken it was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times periodtoken my favorite salsas are the red salsa from the michoacan region of mexico with its nice garlic kick periodtoken  the ingredients in the burrito were fresh commatoken but there were two significant flaws periodtoken no periodtoken 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else periodtoken usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans commatoken but not in this case periodtoken it made the burrito bland and a little dry periodtoken the second flaw was all the gristle i found on the beef periodtoken my tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time i finished periodtoken i decided to spare yelpers a photo of that periodtoken the margarita was okay periodtoken id get one again but it was routine periodtoken theres basically two kinds of wine bars those that serve wine that wine geeks like these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink periodtoken i get the sense that chipotle is a mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there periodtoken  again commatoken for a chain commatoken they serve good quality food periodtoken i can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town periodtoken  chipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking periodtoken for people who have never had a good chipotle in a mexican restaurant commatoken i would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla devil shrimp at la fuente in sparks periodtoken its quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at chipotle but it has great depth of flavor periodtoken","2313":"great location at the end of the wharf periodtoken get a table outside on the side where you can drink alcohol periodtoken be prepared to wait for a long time for these spots periodtoken interesting to watch them prepare and cook the crabs periodtoken shared an assortment of food periodtoken calamari and rock crab were delicious periodtoken lobster bisque was not very flavorful too creamy commatoken not enough lobster and bread bowl was very dry periodtoken","2322":"only a three star review because we were only able to try the crab cakes and the clam chowder commatoken so its not fair to give this place too high or too low of a mark  quickly crab cakes  tender and crumbly periodtoken they dont taste like crab which is what i prefer periodtoken the crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings i loved those periodtoken  clam chowder  pretty standard periodtoken it didnt blow your mind commatoken but it also wasnt too fishy which can happen with clam chowder periodtoken  we saw everyone ordering crab and lobster commatoken and we just salivated at the thought  we had dinner plans later that day so we couldnt try any of the big shellfish items periodtoken they definitely looked delicious  some notes  the indoor seating is limited periodtoken its a small shack at the end of the pier periodtoken it was cold and windy the day we were there yeah commatoken can you believe it so there was more of a wait to sit inside periodtoken  not good for big groups indoors parking is free with validation","2345":"the parking lot and the people surrounding it is a little scary periodtoken  the store is limited in my opinion periodtoken definitely has its pros and cons periodtoken i found out there is an app u can download to load digital coupons by that seems like its all the perks they have periodtoken  i was impressed that my nagger asked if i would like to have him load my bags in my car periodtoken havent had someone ask me that in a grocery store ever  they have the best fried chicken but when i got home i didnt think mine was very fresh like im  used to periodtoken granted it was almost closing time they should have had it discounted in my opinion periodtoken","2346":"we stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered a classic and the depot burger commatoken we asked specifically that they be rare commatoken the classic came in closer to medium commatoken and depot burger had no pink at all commatoken why is it so hard to make a rare burger periodtoken any way the food was good commatoken the grilled onions were awesome periodtoken our waitress was great and the over cook burger was removed from our bill with an apology periodtoken talk about being a stand up place commatoken we will go again and most likely recommend periodtoken","2352":"the day before i leave for las vegas for my bachelor party boo suggests we spend a healthy and romantic evening together by eating at agno for dinner then walking down to lite choice periodtoken considering the next meal i would have would be a heineken courtesy of southwest airlines at 730 in the morning i figured maybe it would be a good idea to keep in healthy periodtoken   walking in i almost felt like et when the government comes in and throws him on a table in the blue tent periodtoken it was so bright in there i felt like all my blemishes and insecurities would be exposed periodtoken its a very big store commatoken much larger than other froyo places in the city and is well equipped to feed the masses in the dead of summer periodtoken   when i walked to the counter the girl working there was very friendly and gave me a few suggestions which i didnt take and i actually went for the tres leche which is coconut and dulce de leche mixed periodtoken i got a medium with carob chips on top and it came out over 6 periodtoken i expected to pay a lot  just because that seems to be the theme of phila yogurt shops periodtoken what was interesting is that they whipped the yogurt once it was in the cup to make it seem bigger periodtoken i thought this was kinda weird commatoken id rather have some dense yogurt than something light and airy but whatev periodtoken  the flavor was really good periodtoken not mind blowing but really good periodtoken what i really liked most about is that its all organic and they dont use high fructose corn syrup periodtoken that is extremely important to me periodtoken most places dont use hormone treated diary so that was almost expected but the corn syrup was a nice touch periodtoken  i cant say this would be my first choice but i can definitely see myself going back here periodtoken","2360":"dirty bathrooms and very slow service commatoken but i was pleased because they had a tv on with subtitles and the volume on commatoken and it was turned to the news  a good place to pass some time with a tasty mcsnack and a hot coffee while in philly during a chilly day  we stopped here on the way to a football game and found it a very pleasant and relaxing place to hang out for a while periodtoken","2365":"i go to this casino very often and for long time now periodtoken periodtoken im very upset i need to pay 10 every time i go there for parking periodtoken periodtoken it used to be free and it should be free commatoken for a place like that commatoken that profits really nicely periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it should definitely be complementary periodtoken i understand that now they have construction expenses commatoken but that will also bring more people and the casino will keep profiting even more than before periodtoken if not a complimentary parking for all commatoken at least for locals besides that i would want to see healthier food options commatoken organic at least for how pricy they are commatoken but vegan options would be much better for everyone commatoken and not only food that makes heart disease and cancer periodtoken besides that the casino is clean commatoken professional commatoken and lots of fun","2373":"we were looking forward to dining here and made reservations only to wait over an hour periodtoken  we were disappointed periodtoken  the waitress wasnt very helpful with helping us order from the menu commatoken which is in french periodtoken  she seemed arrogant periodtoken  owners seem like awesome people periodtoken  we loved and miss the bleubird cafe periodtoken","2384":"overpriced mediocre at best periodtoken try bjs around the corner periodtoken its a bit more  but worth it periodtoken food is better too periodtoken this place is like tgif and on its way out","2393":"passably good dim sum periodtoken i was in love with the chinese broccoli in oyster sauce commatoken the sesame and red bean balls commatoken and the shrimp stuffed eggplant periodtoken most of the rest was good too periodtoken we also ended up with an odd commatoken gelatinous beef that wasnt to my taste at all but i am sure it was a mistake of ordering to my liking rather than sub par cooking by the restaurant periodtoken i would return commatoken but i think i would go for their soup with roast duck and dumplings over dim sum next time periodtoken their duck and pork and bakery case items always look so tasty when i am here periodtoken","2404":"yum periodtoken i love everything about these burgers periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenexcept the price periodtoken they arent horribly expensive but they are expensive enough for me to only go if i absolutely cannot settle for anything else for lunch periodtoken i also hate how they charge 0 periodtoken5  1 periodtoken00 for every extra topping you want on it periodtoken an extra dollar for tomato and lettuce commatoken seriously but they are really great burgers and the fries and milkshakes are amazing periodtoken the buns are delicious and they cook their juicy patties exactly how you want it periodtoken the other thing i dislike is the noise level periodtoken it is really hard to hear when they call your order periodtoken but i still come here for lunch simply because it is delicious periodtoken","2423":"i can only say that i completely agree with everything dan n said on his review periodtoken basically same experience periodtoken one person in our party ordered the roll and it can only half baked with raw dough in the middle periodtoken waitress got an attitude with us like it was our fault periodtoken they put the roll back in the oven for a few and brought it back still uncooked periodtoken now we are sitting here still waiting for the replacement to come and all are finished with our meals periodtoken ugh","2427":"nice little place periodtoken excellent service periodtoken  pancakes were dry commatoken omelet was good periodtoken coffee very good periodtoken  its average fare commatoken but you do get a lot for your money periodtoken","2447":"this is a cute little place commatoken but it needs to define itself a little better periodtoken  perhaps i was expecting too much after hearing it described as a gourmet grocery store periodtoken  i was dreaming of a tiny whole foods in downtown tampa periodtoken  i didnt expect the mostly nonorganic produce section to be found in a single refrigerator or to find bagged shredded cheese in the dairy section periodtoken  i appreciate the low prices for the sandwiches periodtoken  they are preassembled commatoken but they get heatedpressed to order periodtoken  i tried the turkey reuben periodtoken  something in the sandwich either the turkey or the sauerkraut was very herby commatoken and it dominated the dish commatoken so i didnt get that wonderful reuben harmony i expected periodtoken  it was disappointing periodtoken  i probably wont return for a sandwich commatoken but this is a nice place to grab a bottle of wine or beer and maybe some gourmet snacks periodtoken  this is certainly not a replacement for a real grocery store periodtoken","2468":"located on lower level section by the pool entry offering predictable grease bombs commatoken home of burgers and fries periodtoken if there are others in your party not wanting burgers go to the caf\u00e9 periodtoken   onion rings were great but could not substitute for fries in meal deal so had to order separately periodtoken   every 45min or so they turned up the music really loud for 1 song and staff including manager featured  dance choreography to entertain periodtoken   to sit sooner than later they split up my 8 person party to two tables commatoken offering to move a table up to a booth when other customers finished we were settledresolved to it by then but it was nice they asked periodtoken","2471":"came in for a midweek lunch with a coworker periodtoken  service is casual commatoken on the friendly but brisk side commatoken which was not a problem periodtoken the presentation isnt fancy commatoken its definitely simple with light decor periodtoken  i ordered a croquemonsieur commatoken which came nicely toasty with a generous helping of sliced tomatoes periodtoken the sandwich itself was quite nice commatoken with flavorful ham periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the tomatoes were on the mealy side and didnt add much to the plate periodtoken  overall a very middleground experience commatoken perhaps another dish will hit the right spot some other time periodtoken definitely a big plus that they are attached to la baguette treat yourself on the way out periodtoken","2508":"the food here was much better when it first opened periodtoken  still a solid and easy bbq and meat option just not enough to go 4 stars even periodtoken  the meat is good periodtoken  the sides are what has declined periodtoken their biscuits arent that great  a little too dense periodtoken  nice selection of desserts periodtoken","2510":"a much better tour than miller coors but still too big and way too long periodtoken although it was cool to see some clydesdales up close commatoken i couldve done without the 20 minutes in their barn periodtoken  if youre interesting in brewing beer commatoken id say the tour is actually quite informative periodtoken unlike miller where they mark off how many drinks youve ordered commatoken busch is a little more lax periodtoken although youre technically only allowed 2 beers each commatoken they dont use tickets or markers so its quite easy to sneak in a few more samples periodtoken","2514":"im pretty mixed on this place periodtoken service was great periodtoken super happy and friendly periodtoken price was right periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken a buck a donut or less if you order a bunch is just right periodtoken  selection was excellent commatoken and a lot of donuts were kept in a warming oven so that it would be served warm periodtoken  all that was great periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but i didnt think the donut was anything special periodtoken  i got a cinnasquare periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and it was just a really sugary donut periodtoken  not so much cinnamon periodtoken square doesnt affect the taste commatoken sorry to say periodtoken  i cant speak to the other donuts commatoken and there seemed to be a lot of regular customers slamming this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so perhaps i should have gone with the pbj that got many positive comments on the spot periodtoken  compared to dunkin id come to this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but any other local donut place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this is just ok periodtoken","2524":"sandwiches and sides during lunch were ok but we had poor service periodtoken after our server delivered our food he never did check back with us periodtoken finally had to flag him down to get what we needed periodtoken in the past cheddars was enjoyable but the last few visits havent been periodtoken","2541":"the 30th street cosi doesnt feature anything special that sets it apart from any of the other cosi locations in the city say commatoken rittenhouse or 36th and walnut commatoken but it works for when im en route to the train and craving a hot drink or something to munch on and a wifi friendly spot if i have time to kill periodtoken  my usual if im sitting in for a meal is the pesto chicken melt or a chicken margherita flatbread pizza commatoken but its highly unlikely that will happen at this cosi periodtoken  only if i miss my train periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","2552":"not a bad place for a sandwich or salad periodtoken  focus on fresh and healthy food periodtoken  flatbreads made in store periodtoken","2553":"i had an our to kill before meeting some friends so i stopped in for a cup of tea and a snack periodtoken unfortunately commatoken they were out of the tea i wanted so i settled for another type periodtoken and the spinachfeta pastry that i had was yummy i wish it could have been toasted rather than heated in the microwave periodtoken  the staff was nice and apologetic about the missing tea periodtoken the space indoors is cozy commatoken but the tables are pretty well spaced periodtoken the front patio area is spacious periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif sitting near veterans hwy is your sort of thing periodtoken  so lets discuss why this shop gets 3 not 4 stars periodtoken the parking lot sucks periodtoken because the space has a drive through commatoken parking spaces are almost nonexistent periodtoken and all the nearby businesses have threatening signs about parking in their lots with dire consequences promised periodtoken","2556":"this is apparently a favorite among some folks i work with commatoken but last night was the first time id tried it periodtoken im glad i did  the upstairs seating area was pretty sparsely populated on a wednesday night commatoken but there were some folks watching game 1 in the bar downstairs  we knew about it because of the hoots when something good happened for the cards periodtoken   the drink menu was diverse and yet manageable periodtoken quite often when i go to some restaurants in places like st periodtoken louis or denver commatoken the drink menu seems to be competing for who can use the most trees to document the amount of alcohol they have available periodtoken for someone who is terrible at making choices commatoken i hate those places commatoken since theres just too much good stuff kudos commatoken baileys range commatoken for helping those of us who are indecisive  i ended up ordering a red wine to go with by burger  interesting choice commatoken i know commatoken but i was not feeling beer last night for whatever reason periodtoken i ordered the smoked burger commatoken which has caramelized onions and cheese and rooster sauce periodtoken it was awesome periodtoken the bun was soaking up all the delicious grease from the cheese and the meat commatoken and the whole experience was just great periodtoken   i would definitely recommend this place for burgers  there wasnt much else on the menu to choose from commatoken but this would be a great hitthespot place for a burger craving","2565":"tried this placed based on yelp reviews periodtoken  beef brisket  tendon noodle soup was as most reviewers report  delicious periodtoken  pancake wrapped pork was a new dish to us commatoken and very good as well periodtoken  we also had mango and blueberry fruit slushes  refreshing and tasty commatoken and probably not easily found in reno periodtoken  the disappointment commatoken however commatoken for me was the pork chow fun periodtoken  the noodles were oily commatoken yellow like they were egg and not rice and a bit chewy versus the usual wider commatoken white ho fan ribbon noodles periodtoken  dry fried chow fun typically has brown char marks from wok frying which provide the flavor commatoken and these noodles didnt seem like they were fried periodtoken  a better nearby choice for chow fun commatoken imho commatoken would be pho mein in the el dorado periodtoken","2576":"i had lunch buffet on sunday periodtoken the food was alright periodtoken i wish the buffet trays were warmer periodtoken i think the best dishes were their fresh nans and green peapaneer periodtoken","2580":"we chose this establishment because it was adjacent to our hotel and didnt really want to leave since we had just driven over 5hrs periodtoken we were seated immediately and orders were taken periodtoken we both opted for the steak tips special periodtoken i informed the waiter id like my steak mediumwell periodtoken he said they only fixed it one way periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken mediumish periodtoken at that point commatoken i became scared periodtoken i will not eat meat that is red periodtoken i have never ordered steak and not been asked how id like it cooked periodtoken ever once food arrived commatoken my husband said the salad was the best hes ever eaten but the steak was definitely cooked medium periodtoken i didnt order a side salad i opted to eat the smaller pieces as they were cooked to my liking periodtoken the onion straws that were under the steak got me excited because they are my all time favorite side item commatoken but they were chewy as if they had laid under a heat lamp a little too long and were not fresh periodtoken i was very disappointed in this 80 meal periodtoken had the steak been cooked medium well and the onion straws fresh commatoken this meal wouldve been delicious","2581":"had a panini and a chocolate chip cookie from this place for a quick lunch on a trip to nashville periodtoken was very impressed with the quality of the bread and the cookie periodtoken the sandwich overall was just a fine commatoken standard panini but i did enjoy the seeds present in the bread and id like to go back and try something else next time periodtoken","2583":"well lets start with the good periodtoken panera type restaurant with good food and laid back atmosphere periodtoken now with the bad a focus on the staff periodtoken every time i go up there the staff seems to really hate being there or has an attitude youd prefer not to see when walking in a place periodtoken it actually makes me not want to go up there for food anymore periodtoken definetly not world class customer service on any scale and the sad thing is commatoken they barely have to interact with you periodtoken","2589":"good food but the quality doesnt seem to justify the prices periodtoken  seems they should lower the price point by a dollar or two for the entrees periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken 16 for a bowl seems a bit steep periodtoken","2599":"i love poke bowls periodtoken i became obsessed in cali periodtoken so much delicious fish at such good price periodtoken so much cheaper than sashimi periodtoken so when this place opened commatoken i showed up on the first day periodtoken i couldnt wait but unfortunately i was let down periodtoken  1 periodtoken they were really friendly 2 periodtoken i got the biggest bowl 11 periodtoken95 and i was highly disappointed at how small it was also they gave me very little fish periodtoken  3 periodtoken when we got to the veggies commatoken the owner told me i could pick whichever and how many i wanted periodtoken so obviously i picked one of each periodtoken  4 periodtoken when paying commatoken somehow my order went from 11 periodtoken95 to 19 something   they had charged me for some of the extra veggies commatoken but he never told me about that or else i wouldnt have picked one of each periodtoken  overall commatoken i will give it a try in a few months once they are more established bc i want so bad to have a poke bowl place in the city periodtoken there will be another poke bowl restaurant opening soon in chinatown commatoken so hope that one is better than this one periodtoken","2602":"im loving this whole fresh local food trend periodtoken it makes me feel so healthy even though it may not be periodtoken   so the last time i was there commatoken i ordered the spicy avocado and lime kale and grain bowl periodtoken it was delicious it was so filling that i was able to share it with someone else periodtoken the fiancee ordered the buffalo chicken burger and wasnt all that impressed periodtoken he said it was kind of boring periodtoken so i guess its a hit or miss depending on what you order periodtoken  my only complaint would be some of the employees  having to deal with unpleasant people kind of ruins your dining experience just a bit periodtoken","2627":"food was good service was great periodtoken we all liked the beer variety commatoken and the bourbon list is amazing periodtoken we started with pork cracklings and fried green tomatoes periodtoken you dont get many cracklings but they are really good periodtoken the tomatoes were actually cooked almost perfect a few were alittle dark but still delicious periodtoken i order smoked sausage commatoken it was more like a spicy smoke sausage you buy at your local price chopper periodtoken note this i thought i was ordering a sausage plate but i only got a bare plate full of sausage no sides no bread periodtoken my wife got the veggie burger and sweet pot fries commatoken burger was so so fries were good periodtoken the couple with us said they liked theres so i cannot contest periodtoken the service and atmosphere is where it was at periodtoken oh i did try some of my buddies pulled pork and it was really good commatoken remembered now cause i wish i would have ordered it","2628":"you know commatoken i keep giving these guys a chance in hopes that they will improve periodtoken they have not periodtoken  i had to clear my throat loudly to entice someone to come from the back to actually help me periodtoken  i was in on a sunday afternoon and while they werent busy there were hardly any cupcakes to purchase periodtoken i was surprised by the lack of variety despite being there with over 3 hours of business hours left until closing periodtoken the two cupcakes i purchased were lemon for the wife commatoken and a chocolate caramel pretzel combo of some sort periodtoken once i paid for them i was anxious to eat mine periodtoken   i got them home and once we had lunch it was time for dessert periodtoken my wife tried hers commatoken one bite was all she took to be done periodtoken she said it the icing was too sweet and the cake too dry periodtoken i felt the same about my mine periodtoken also commatoken the caramel part in the description was not at all present in my cupcake periodtoken it really amounted to overly granulated sugary icing with crushed up pretzel bits on top periodtoken the frosting had crusted over so it clearly wasnt fresh periodtoken the cake was also dry so it too wasnt fresh periodtoken you are a cupcake place commatoken that only makes cupcakes but you cant do that well clearly commatoken this just doesnt compute periodtoken  next time commatoken i will save myself from these dry cupcakes and make my own periodtoken","2629":"just had lunch there commatoken ordered the red

chili periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand i am glad she went with a bowl versus a cup commatoken because commatoken well periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe hummus never came periodtoken the turkey chili was quite delicious commatoken and i give it a good recommendation periodtoken   i elected to go with one of the days specials periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwalnutencrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables periodtoken what does that mean exactly parsnips instead of potatoes parsnips and potatoes i am pretty sure there was no yucca involved periodtoken lol i digress periodtoken the mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though periodtoken the string beans tasted of charred water periodtoken the walnutencrusted chicken was a tasty idea commatoken but the crusting was quite overcooked commatoken again lending a burnt flavor periodtoken the chicken came covered in a maple gravy periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmild taste of maple commatoken and it was a cream gravy periodtoken i was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor periodtoken  the waiter did not bring me a knife and fork commatoken which was his second strike after the missed hummus periodtoken i was so hungry i did not care commatoken however periodtoken i cleaned my plate thoroughly periodtoken   on to the ice cream my lady friend and i split a belgian waffle commatoken topped with ice cream periodtoken as the man commatoken the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor periodtoken i went with cinnamon bun commatoken and it was great periodtoken the waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly commatoken slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top periodtoken the creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent commatoken especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamonsugarized butter periodtoken  wowzers periodtoken   the service was a little sketchy and i had some issues with my entree commatoken but i would definitely come by and give them another chance periodtoken i recommend you do commatoken too","2655":"went there today for dinner with family periodtoken  service was ok commatoken drinks were pretty

question periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot cool at all  once again commatoken i love starbucks they just need help being more friendly towards people periodtoken","2698":"i got the beef chow fun and it was okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the beef was very fatty but the noodles and flavor were great the place is kind of hard to find which is a down fall periodtoken boba milk tea was good  something along the lines of a chain chinese restaurant periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but packed full of people","2702":"i love their frozen custard so creamy and good periodtoken yummmmmmmmy periodtoken not an everyday dessert because its super duper rich but perfect as a special treat periodtoken  okay commatoken on to food periodtoken ive only eaten here once and its not the

periodtoken","2732":"eat upstairs for a great view periodtoken not the best but not the worst food periodtoken i would probably go again periodtoken","2739":"definitely not the best donuts in town commatoken but props for creativity periodtoken if you like waiting in long lines commatoken only to be rewarded with a diabetic coma periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken strange donuts is for you sd is a fun commatoken novelty donut shop that overdelivers in presentation and variety commatoken but lacks in terms of actual donut quality periodtoken i love the whole concept of introducing collaborations with other local haunts bogarts mai lee very stl spirit periodtoken however commatoken i think the most effective collaboration they could pursue would be one with donut drivein periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken maybe someone could help them with their overall donut execution periodtoken my critique of sd comes from a place of love ive been here 3 or 4 times commatoken but each time im let down when it comes to the actual taste of the donuts periodtoken conceptually commatoken they have amazing offerings commatoken but if you just want a goddamn donut commatoken this shouldnt be your first stop periodtoken","2748":"just outside of downtown tampa this spot is a good place for meeting a friend or business associate for coffee if they dont want to deal with parking downtown periodtoken   seriously the place is really cool theyve recently expanded to occupy the entire building so there is plenty of seating inside periodtoken the look of the place is engaging and useful periodtoken the community table spaces are comfortable and the other random seating arrangements breakup the space very well periodtoken  the service is always friendly and personal and they serve good coffee too periodtoken  the biggest challenge to the location is parking periodtoken taking the hart 30 that runs along kennedy is a good alternative periodtoken","2749":"good location commatoken pleasant atmosphere and super cute designs on the lattes periodtoken ordered a mocha commatoken latte commatoken and vanilla latte and scone periodtoken because the mocha and vanilla latte are sweetened commatoken they were good periodtoken however commatoken the unsweetened latte was bitter periodtoken the scone i hate to be harsh commatoken but was just flavorless periodtoken also commatoken everything just felt needlessly overpriced periodtoken","2767":"ive eaten here several times over the past few years and i have to say their service has gotten progressively better periodtoken when i first started frequenting this place mainly ordering takeout it used to take a very long time for my order to be ready periodtoken i would order and wait about 45 minutes before picking up and then when i would get there it would take an additional 3045 minutes before the food was actually ready periodtoken so commatoken i stopped going there even though the food was worth the wait periodtoken it gets old periodtoken ive tried quite a few things on the menu though i usually get the fried chicken platter with greens and potato salad commatoken or the fried whiting with the same sides periodtoken i have tried other sides like string beans too soft commatoken cabbage good commatoken greens good commatoken and garlic mash good periodtoken their fish hoagie is really tasty and their turkey chops are as well periodtoken what i love about this place is that it is black owned periodtoken i also love that their food is seasoned well and their portions are big enough to feed a small family periodtoken tonight i ordered fried whiting platters for my fianc\u00e9 and me and both had 6 pieces of fish with a heaping of sides periodtoken their prices are good and i did not have to wait forever when i went to pick up my order periodtoken nice job on the changes periodtoken i will def patronize again periodtoken","2789":"decent little dive on metairie road periodtoken often empty commatoken but they seem like theyre stepping up their game with some new promotions periodtoken food is pretty good commatoken especially compared to the equivalent dives in the area periodtoken all in all commatoken a pretty decent place to step in for a quick drink commatoken but i wouldnt pass a whole lot of time here periodtoken","2801":"pei wei is the american version of the asian cuisine periodtoken there dishes are made to order in an open concept kitchen periodtoken the food and servive is always good periodtoken i love the quick atmosphere periodtoken keep in mind its not a full service restaurant periodtoken  i recommend there mango california roll and there crab wontons periodtoken on there main dishes they offer two different sizes periodtoken make sure you let them know if you want the small or regular because if you dont most likely the will give you the regular and trust me its a nice portion periodtoken     we have eaten here many times and always enjoyed it periodtoken","2805":"service was not bad and the steak chimichanga i had was great periodtoken the house margarita was terrible periodtoken watered down and hardly any tequila made me ask

bad at all","2806":"good craft beer periodtoken reasonable prices periodtoken i had a pizza that was awesome periodtoken one daughter had a steak that she really enjoyed periodtoken another daughter had a huge tasty burger periodtoken wife had a salad that had one ingredient she didnt care for commatoken artichoke hearts i think periodtoken definitely a welcome addition to the area periodtoken the only negatives were the hostesses and the speed of service periodtoken the hostesses ignored me upon arrival then acknowledged and seated the next family that came through the door periodtoken then they tried to seat us at the worst spot in the restaurant when more desirable tables in the main area were open periodtoken food came out really slow periodtoken the family that was seated just before me finished and left before our food came out periodtoken","2811":"the location is hard to get into and out of but its nice inside and has a decently large menu periodtoken the pho isnt the best ive ever had but its hard to mess up pho periodtoken it was pretty good and the portion was pretty big for 8 periodtoken the main issue was that it took 19 minutes to receive my food periodtoken i paid and sat down and i waited and waited and waited periodtoken my receipt was time stamped so thats how i know it was 19 minutes periodtoken they were busy so i guess if i ever come back i will try not to come back at such a busy time periodtoken all in all commatoken not bad periodtoken i may or may not be back but if youre nearby commatoken stop on in periodtoken its pretty good periodtoken","2820":"dinner here was great until the very end commatoken but my opinion was definitely soured by being informed we do not accept credit cards only after i went to pay with a credit card periodtoken i checked the doorway on the way out  nope commatoken no sign periodtoken there was nothing on the check to indicate they were cashonly commatoken i dont remember seeing it listed on the menu and i look for these things while dinner was delicious commatoken that is a customer service fail that left me lessthanimpressed periodtoken   up to that point commatoken though commatoken i very much enjoyed my dinner here periodtoken we started by sharing an order of spring rolls commatoken two large rolls were served cut in half which was a nice portion for sharing periodtoken the peanut sauce they are served with is delicious i had the panang curry always delicious commatoken although not anything particularly innovative periodtoken my friends had the pineapple fried rice i had a taste  again commatoken good but nothing mindblowing and sweet basil chicken this is something i had never tasted before  yum periodtoken portion sizes were generous and the prices are reasonable periodtoken service was ok  there was a long wait between appetizer and entrees commatoken and for a while our water glasses were very neglected periodtoken   they would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for their poor advertising of the cashonly policy periodtoken if you like thai food theyre worth a visit commatoken just make sure to hit up the atm before you head in","2833":"used groupon for a better deal periodtoken  i was excited to try out this place because ive never ate down on a wharf before and i was in santa barbara doing sb buggy so i thought this place would be perfect for dinner periodtoken   parking  can be found on the streets or public parking building or park on the wharf periodtoken  seating wait time depending of if you want fa first available commatoken o outside commatoken i inside seating periodtoken   i prefer the outside seating because there are more space to put your dishes and you get the view of the ocean periodtoken so why not

periodtoken  the fish and chips i had on my first visit were fine commatoken but not the best ive had commatoken but not the fish sticks some restaurants like to try to pass off as real fish either periodtoken  today i had the pear gorgonzola melt periodtoken i liked it commatoken because it was something different than what youd get at most places periodtoken  the onion rings were huge and i think would have been  good had they not been so salty periodtoken   they do have things on the menu that look like they could be good commatoken so i would go back periodtoken  oh and where it says rasher bacon on the menu commatoken think ham periodtoken my son who really wanted a blt was very dissappointed in his rasher bacon lt periodtoken","2847":"i really liked the atmosphere and the fresh and yummy ingredients periodtoken im still trying to find the best pizza place in reno and i give this three stars for their delicious salads and toppings but minus two stars because i like thinner commatoken whole wheat crust periodtoken still doesnt compare to moms homemade pizzas","2850":"while the service was fast and everyone seemed friendly periodtoken my issue with this business is that while we were waiting to pay the person who i assume is the manager was berating an employee for not realizing a customer didnt pay for her ice cream periodtoken he was doing this while standing in front of the cash register periodtoken if you need to discuss something with your employees dont do it right in front of customers especially when you are being incredibly rude and over the top periodtoken maybe if you had a better system in place instead of just assuming everyone around you knows whats going on this problem wouldnt happen periodtoken","2851":"overpriced and understaffed periodtoken let start with giant stores always have all the items and stock you need but at what cost a great cost i find giant stores merchandise is cat least 35 higher than other stores in the area commatoken acme is a very close second periodtoken   if you shop after 8pm its very hard to find associates to help you locate items or answer questions periodtoken on the up side the deli items are reasonably priced and fresh but beware of the seafood as its not always the freshest periodtoken   in a pinch i shop here for instance commatoken on the way to work and i need to bring the drinks or dessert periodtoken this market would not be the preferred place for my personal or family shopping but its clean commatoken well lit and stocked periodtoken","2853":"this place is very convenient seeing how its literally downstairs periodtoken great quality deli meat with bores head products but dont you dare ask for anything extra on your sandwich or salad unless youre in the mood to get sodomized periodtoken they can get pricey periodtoken that being said they have some great selections and are pretty friendly periodtoken basics are fairly priced but frozen food is an arm and leg periodtoken long review short commatoken its the same as every other convenience store but with some organic food periodtoken","2866":"no more maine root no more pimento cheese its these items that made this place a go to for us periodtoken no longer periodtoken","2878":"seemed like a typical cupcake shop periodtoken the icing commatoken per usual commatoken was sweet and the prices were a bit

arteryclogging snack periodtoken think tiny mozzarella sticks that have a bit more bang with the ooeygooey cheese curds periodtoken i finally had the chance to try this out at the hustling and bustling jersey city project market commatoken where there were quite a few other food vendors inside and food trucks lined up outside periodtoken i was surprised the cow and the curd truck had no line commatoken compared to the other vendors and food trucks periodtoken then i noticed the portion size you got for 9 dipping sauces cost extra periodtoken there were 8 very tiny cheese bites that fit in a little paper basket that fit inside my small hand periodtoken it seemed you got a better bang for your buck at the other food spots periodtoken im not sure if these are made to order or just kept warm because when i went up and placed my order commatoken i was immediately handed a basket that was just sitting there periodtoken it was gooey inside commatoken but definitely not the kind of hot youd get from being pulled from the fryer periodtoken im glad i knocked it off my food bucket list but i probably wont be searching them out again periodtoken","2888":"make the burgers bigger or lower the price periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand please dont charge for the sauces commatoken cmon but periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni like this place regardless periodtoken","2893":"this definitely looks like it was a pizza hut back in the 80s periodtoken i would not have guessed it was a greek place judging by the exterior periodtoken   its nothing fancy commatoken but i had a great lunch here periodtoken huge and delicious gyros periodtoken only 7 and comes with the perfect diner fries periodtoken they also have wonderful tzatziki commatoken which is a must for any greek restaurant periodtoken","2898":"the food took a long time to come periodtoken if the kitchen had been fast i would have given it 5 stars periodtoken","2903":"my husband and i stopped in for a late bite and a glass of wine on a snowy cold weekday evening periodtoken there were only 5 other patrons periodtoken we ordered the local beef burger commatoken which was sort of a thin patty commatoken but tasty commatoken and a pizza that was fine periodtoken our waitress was friendly and pleasant periodtoken the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy periodtoken we would definitely go back under the same circumstances periodtoken i give it three stars because of the food periodtoken","2948":"you cant escape the coffee smell that pours into the ybor streets even from blocks away periodtoken at first my zombieselfcraving coffee wondered why the building was so huge commatoken when upon entering all i could see was a small shop with a couple cafe tables periodtoken   interesting but through the glass behind the barista was a flurry of activity periodtoken they roast and package the coffee in that building that explains the size and smell of the place plus commatoken wander into a small side room to view little coffeerelated gifts periodtoken  service eh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken brisk and  businesslike periodtoken no smiles yet hardworking periodtoken eh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken maybe they need some of their own coffee periodtoken  taste is it the barista or the coffee the coffees tastes were watered down and no amount of con leche could save it periodtoken","2964":"been here 3 other times everything was good commatoken today i ordered the steak and bacon chopped salad took 1 bite and it was terrible periodtoken i put my

must have had an off day today periodtoken hopefully its better next time periodtoken","2975":"not as good as you would expect periodtoken i ordered a sheet cake and i said something to someone when buying it commatoken how long would it last periodtoken they told me it would last at least a week periodtoken the cake was like a rock the next day periodtoken it was not made fresh that day periodtoken more like a week before i bought it periodtoken donuts are not much better either periodtoken at least they lasted a day longer then the cake periodtoken this place is not as good as it use to be 10 years ago periodtoken its getting worse periodtoken time for new owners to step in periodtoken  update 5132018   new owners have taken over and my how this place has changed periodtoken they have even added extra hours and have redone the sidewalks periodtoken food is way better then it was periodtoken finally a good bakery in the area periodtoken 3 stars for now to see how things go periodtoken","2993":"went here because of a coupon and its proximity to the movie theater periodtoken  i cant remember what kind of frozen yogurt i had commatoken but it was just as good as any froyo

disappointed by the food here periodtoken  ive been back a few times commatoken good burger commatoken fries commatoken milk shake periodtoken  the inconsistency happens when getting my order periodtoken  id bump it up a star if i actually got what i ordered commatoken but the last two times that didnt happen periodtoken","3023":"easy place to get too periodtoken  the meals are price reasonable periodtoken  the only fault was there were a lot of dirty tables","3029":"i was told by many that the banh mis were good here but i have had better periodtoken i think for the price you get an excellence size and value but the quality of the sandwich itself commatoken at least the grilled pork variety commatoken could have been better periodtoken i am sure that there are better banh mi stands in the area but this one for sure is solid periodtoken dont expect amazing but expect good periodtoken","3053":"my chicken was very good periodtoken my 8 periodtoken00 shrimp meal however wasnt worth the price periodtoken  they use medium size shrimp periodtoken the key lime pie was delicious periodtoken i would go back commatoken but ill stick with chicken next time","3058":"very sweet and quaint little italian restaurant periodtoken it did remind me of italy periodtoken the decor and the italian speaking waiter  this place is definitely full of locals periodtoken probably a local favorite periodtoken they set us up at a table where we could sit next to each other as requested periodtoken so nice of them to accommodate periodtoken  we also brought our own bottle of wine which they charged a 30 corkage fee periodtoken a little higher then other restaurants in the area periodtoken the food was good periodtoken my bf ordered chicken masala periodtoken he enjoyed it very much periodtoken i ordered the fish special commatoken halibut periodtoken it was just ok periodtoken a bit over cooked which made the fish taste dry periodtoken we followed by ordering two desserts  affogato caffe and tiramisu periodtoken both were very good periodtoken","3084":"cool place to go to for a wonderful healthy atmosphere periodtoken nice that you can order from a kiosk or order from a person over the counter periodtoken the papaya tea is awesome commatoken potato soup is great commatoken the french baguette was nice and crunchy but too chewy for me periodtoken my turkey bravo sandwich was delicious commatoken loved the tomato basil bread used for the sandwich periodtoken  sucks that your view is of best buy commatoken would of rather they turned the windows into a way they could change the vie into something else periodtoken food is fresh and healthy periodtoken you will crave it even if you dont like to eat healthy periodtoken give it a try and i guarantee you wont be disappointed periodtoken","3086":"ahhh it is ok but nowhere near the ambiance of cafe du monde periodtoken  ive never seen this place crowded so you do get super fast service periodtoken  i really dont care for beignets but they have those here too and it is all very similar to cafe du monde except they also have a decent small menu of some new orleans classic dishes so i would say the dining options here are far superior to cafe du monde but a terrible location in a strip mall periodtoken","3087":"decent food periodtoken messed up take out order the one time i did order out with them periodtoken bit pricey periodtoken","3094":"its convenient to run here for my emergency moments ie crap i forgot to buy that one essential ingredient for my dinner recipe but its just too expensive for me to make this my regular market stop periodtoken  however commatoken i will say that the service here is quite enjoyable periodtoken the management definitely strive to maintain an aura of being your friendly neighborhood grocer periodtoken   and while i havent stooped low enough to consider delivery i do live only a few blocks away periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they do offer it which is a nice plus if you wantneed it  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","3096":"the prices are a little high for ice cream that tastes about the same at the supermarket periodtoken i only got the cookie dough concrete and i will be sure to try something a bit more exotic next time to see if the ice cream is worth its price tag periodtoken","3099":"i love baileys range commatoken so when i was in town for just the weekend with 2 of my friends commatoken i insisted that we go there periodtoken we had an average wait time about 30 mins on a saturday night which we thought was great periodtoken however commatoken upon being seated we waited about 10 minutes before water was even brought to us periodtoken and then waited another 1015 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink periodtoken we waited about another 1015 minutes for our drinks the limoncello is delicious and refreshing for summer periodtoken our food came quickly maybe 20 minutes after we ordered periodtoken it came hot and delicious commatoken but we were missing sauces commatoken out of water and our server was no where to be found periodtoken maybe another 10 minutes after we had gotten our food we were finally provided with more water and out sauces periodtoken the food was very good commatoken did not disappoint periodtoken after we were done commatoken we waited with our plates for about another 10 minutes before our serve came periodtoken we then requested our checks commatoken which is the first thing they brought promptly all night periodtoken we got our cards out commatoken then waited another 1015 minutes before she picked up our checks commatoken which seemed odd to me because typically turn around once you get the check seems to be pretty quick in most restaurants periodtoken perhaps the server was double sat commatoken or new or something commatoken which i could understand the slowness commatoken but the server never apologized for us having to wait on her countless times periodtoken   tldr the food was excellent as always commatoken but the service was severely lacking on this trip periodtoken honestly bothered my whole dining experience there periodtoken hopefully they do better next time periodtoken","3120":"im rating this based on my yogurt and mcconells ice cream periodtoken  i had the cookies and cream mcconells ice cream and it was delish i couldnt get enough the creaminess and taste was wow they have a good selection of their ice cream and i would definitely recc ppl to try the strawberry boudeux but i thought that was too sweet for my taste periodtoken   i didnt like their yogurt because it was not good commatoken it was overly sweet and their chocolate commatoken well you can get it  at costco foodcourt for a better price it melts in your cup commatoken their toppings look like its been out for awhile periodtoken it seems family owned periodtoken    sweet alley is ok for yogurt commatoken but i think you should come here for their ice cream mcconells periodtoken    its kinda pricey but its one of the few places in goleta periodtoken","3162":"food was good periodtoken coffee was just ok periodtoken  service was slow periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we did have a large party but it was like they were doing each cup of coffee and getting each dessert one at a time commatoken and serving us so slowly half the crowd was done before some got their first cup of coffee or anything to eat periodtoken  not well organized at all periodtoken","3168":"brought the kids here for lunch on easter sunday periodtoken  glad we came in commatoken but it did fall short of my expectations periodtoken    teen 2 insisted on onion rings and both girls wanted milk shakes periodtoken  onion rings were giant commatoken good and piping hot with yummy sauce periodtoken  they were absolutely dripping in grease though commatoken and there was a large unappetizing pool of grease left on the plate periodtoken  better on the plate than in my stomach commatoken but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  both girls ordered brownie milkshakes periodtoken  they were delicious commatoken but tiny periodtoken  i liked them so much i decided to order a peanut butter one for myself periodtoken  the lack of peanut butter flavor was a

comically tiny for 3 periodtoken50 periodtoken  i had the american burger on a pretzel bun periodtoken  meat commatoken mac n cheese commatoken cheddar sauce commatoken and bacon on a pretzel roll periodtoken  i didnt love the mac n cheese they used commatoken but the burger was pretty yummy and i couldnt finish it all periodtoken    fries were served cold on the first goround periodtoken  the waitress took them back and replaced them with hot fries without question periodtoken  the hot fries were much better and the teens loved the sauces periodtoken  we chose cheddar and rooster sauces periodtoken  service was excellent our waitress was very friendly and we didnt want for anything throughout the course of the meal periodtoken  i would try them again commatoken with a different burger and not a milkshake periodtoken  kids liked it though and it was a fun and casual way to spend an easter lunch periodtoken","3173":"ive been wanting a hot dog from a hot dog shop and there are none any where around here periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenso im happy  i had two chicago dogs commatoken i asked for it to be grilled i dont like boiled or steamed minus relish and it was good periodtoken ive had better hot dogs in my lifetime but like i said commatoken theres nothing to compare it to around these parts periodtoken the place is pretty clean periodtoken the gyros smell really good so ill try that next time periodtoken i only marked it down one because of the sweet tea i got periodtoken periodtoken it was pretty watered down periodtoken","3175":"honestly commatoken a little overrated commatoken the food is average periodtoken service was friendly periodtoken i didnt care much for the pancakes commatoken they were dry commatoken toppings were nothing special

elegant grocery store in reno commatoken the items sold at whole foods are seriously overpriced periodtoken  thats fine if you are good with giving money away commatoken but im just not that philanthropic when it comes to supporting a corporation periodtoken  while i understand the desire to get organic with it commatoken between wolf pack meats commatoken trader joes commatoken raleys and great basin coop commatoken there arent many items available here  that arent available for 2040 less somewhere else periodtoken  however commatoken its so relaxing to walk the broad commatoken beautifully displayed aisles that im sometimes almost glad this store is the only purveyor of my favorite shampoo periodtoken it costs me about 30 to lay in an 8 month supply  coincidentally commatoken the same time interval between my visits to this store periodtoken  each time commatoken the excellent displays beckon and the gently helpful staff members rave about something new ive never tried commatoken and i end up spending another 30 on stuff i really dont need  i give whole foods credit for having the most extensive selection of teas available at any grocery store commatoken so ive made an unscheduled trip or two just to buy tea periodtoken the catch if you buy one of the teas that is available locally elsewhere commatoken get ready to fork out fiftty cents to a dollar more per package to buy it here periodtoken  damn you whole foods you are a bunch of robber barons periodtoken whole foods ought to create an ira account for each of its regular shoppers because thats the only way theyll have any money left to retire with after shopping here periodtoken","3214":"this place made an ok surf and turf plate but all and all its something you should skip periodtoken over priced lowend seafood periodtoken we only went for the little guy who wanted to see all the tacky decorations periodtoken id never go back","3217":"so commatoken im in nashville for the weekend with friends and we were looking up places to go to for breakfast in the area periodtoken i had already heard about the famous pancake pantry and it ended up being the first place that came up when

periodtoken  day 2 we arrived again commatoken only to find another very large line periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  day 3 we arrived once again commatoken and again found a line commatoken but

periodtoken once we got in commatoken we ordered and waited patiently for our food periodtoken i ordered the chopped ham in scrambled eggs periodtoken somehow commatoken i pictured there would

periodtoken   my review the food was good commatoken but i wouldnt say it was great periodtoken then again commatoken maybe i should have tried some of the other pancakes periodtoken i got a bite from the sweet potato pancakes and those were pretty swell periodtoken all in all commatoken just a really long wait commatoken which is really not good when youre hungry periodtoken also commatoken waiting to pay at the counter on the way out commatoken not good periodtoken","3222":"burger king is an okay alternative to mcdonalds periodtoken 610 would recommend but idk about coming again

of sugar just behind the chili flavors periodtoken  our orange beef and general tso shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber commatoken or had it on the side periodtoken  both were framed in broccoli florets commatoken the much overused nonchinese veggie periodtoken their tastes were fine commatoken but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters periodtoken  the spicy shrimp commatoken scallop  squid with pepper corn salt commatoken was a relief from the cane commatoken and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper periodtoken  finally commatoken my sushi sample of an eel  avocado roll was average commatoken with much more avo than eel commatoken and artificially colored wasabe and ginger periodtoken    bottom line  the suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here periodtoken  everything was accommodating to the local market periodtoken  too much broccoli commatoken and not enough real heat periodtoken not bad if this is what you are looking for periodtoken","3227":"this is not the place for me periodtoken i did not enjoy the food periodtoken we ordered the guacamole which was very basic and unimpressive periodtoken we also ordered the idaho potato and chorizo taco commatoken the chicken tinga taco commatoken the mushroom taco commatoken and the fish taco periodtoken none of these pleased me and i did not find that they were worth the 45 a taco periodtoken i wont be returning to eat here periodtoken   i did like the ambiance and the location of the place periodtoken nicely decorated and clean periodtoken","3248":"very cool atmosphere at old glory periodtoken  it is an old laundry service building and they have left some details of its past life in the new bar periodtoken   i was excited to check it out because i love a good cocktail  the cocktails are good but small and very expensive id suggest to order off menu to get a better deal periodtoken  now that is if you can figure out how to order periodtoken  we were hanging out on the mid level and a waiter would come by every hour or so but not frequent enough to keep with the demand of my group periodtoken  id probably never be back to old glory because its not my scene to clubcity for me periodtoken","3263":"perhaps i need to come back and order something else  but commatoken i think the food doesnt match the hype or the line periodtoken  i ordered your standard eggs commatoken bacon commatoken and buttermilk pancakes and i was a little underwhelmed periodtoken  dare i say that cracker barrel or ihop would have satisfied my pancake craving better periodtoken  im thankful that i got to the restaurant right before the crowd started to pick up i got there around 745 am periodtoken  the strange thing about eating there are the guys that continuously walk around looking for when you take your last bite  so that they can take your plate periodtoken  kinda puts the pressure on to eat quickly and get up and out periodtoken    bottom line decent food not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for commatoken great service commatoken and prime location periodtoken","3267":"it was my last night in the nola area commatoken but i didnt want to travel far or pay outrageous prices for a meal periodtoken i found carrabbas on yelp periodtoken it was close to where i was staying periodtoken my fried and i decided to give it a try commatoken because it could be vegetarian friendly periodtoken well commatoken that does not mean it can be vegan friendly commatoken as i found out periodtoken my server commatoken rebecca p periodtoken was nice enough commatoken but seemed clueless as to what vegan means periodtoken so commatoken we looked over the menu and i decided on a pasta dish commatoken but i would have to modify it a bit to fit my dietary needs periodtoken rebecca brought us our ice tea and my friend ordered first periodtoken now commatoken i know vegan sounds complicated commatoken but its not periodtoken its just this commatoken nothing with a mother and no dairy or eggs periodtoken so commatoken i began explaining my dish commatoken but seems rebecca was not understanding commatoken so i began to explain with my hands commatoken sort of like an italian might do periodtoken boom i knocked over my ice tea all over the table periodtoken we recovered and moved to another table commatoken while they cleaned up my spill mess periodtoken   ok commatoken back to the ordering a veggie pasta commatoken with red sauce and extra veggies commatoken no meat or dairy periodtoken i thought i got that right and that our server understood the order periodtoken hhhhmmm commatoken at least i was hoping that periodtoken when it came time to be served commatoken he order was wrong periodtoken no extra mushrooms and not a drop of red or marinara sauce periodtoken what ok commatoken the poor man serving the food commatoken it was not rebecca commatoken was wide eyed as both me and my friend commatoken in unison commatoken said thats not what i ordered periodtoken our server didnt come by commatoken but juan the kitchen manager came over and asked me how he could help periodtoken he took the dish back to the kitchen commatoken mixed in some red sauce and gave me more on the side periodtoken then commatoken blake commatoken a floor manager and seems he was serving at the bar too commatoken came by to talk to us periodtoken he was pleasant enough too periodtoken now commatoken i think rebecca was flustered and didnt come by until after that commatoken she asked me if i was being taken care of and that the kitchen commatoken juan took care of the mixed up order periodtoken yea commatoken it was commatoken but this should have been her job periodtoken rebecca seems like a nice woman commatoken maybe she just needs to understand what vegan entails periodtoken some of us have to eat this way commatoken not just because it a choice commatoken but because its about health concerns periodtoken and commatoken we still want to go out and eat with our friends periodtoken  i dont know if it was the kitchen or the server that made the mistake commatoken but you would have thought that with such a harsh start to the meal commatoken then a let down in the middle commatoken a discount or coupon would have been offered periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennothing so commatoken while we made due the mess was undone by my standards periodtoken i am grateful for the effort commatoken and i would try the food chain restaurant again commatoken but ill be even more clear on my menu choices and options periodtoken also commatoken it might be wise for this chain to offer at least a couple of vegan options hot and cold commatoken that are not just appetizers periodtoken ill say this about juan and blake commatoken they did their best and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable and welcomed periodtoken thats a good way to get repeat business periodtoken next time commatoken offer the customer a 50 periodtoken00 coupon commatoken thats a way to secure that repeat business periodtoken it doesnt need to be for me commatoken just anyone that feels a bit upside down on the menu and service periodtoken lol","3272":"i really wish lucky goat would carry skim milk periodtoken on several occasions they have either not had it commatoken or worse handed it to me and then i realized that the expiry date had passed periodtoken i can imagine that i am not the only person that doesnt like whole milk or cream in my coffee periodtoken it just seems to me like skim milk should be a staple at a coffee house and it isnt here periodtoken other than that commatoken the service is always friendly and they have a nice assortment of fresh pastries periodtoken it is for sure a welcome addition to the neighborhood periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif management reads these reviews periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenplease consider having fresh skim milk periodtoken","3278":"a nice clean modern look greats you as you enter whitebox periodtoken it wasnt clear to me when i first entered how i was getting service as it turns out order  at counter and items will be delivered to your table periodtoken this is actually my preferred type of service but it makes it a small challenge when i have my son high chair required along with me periodtoken   the food was ok commatoken and the gluten free option is a great bonus commatoken but nothing earth shattering periodtoken to speed along service it appears  most plate items use the same eggbake type base with different toppings periodtoken wife went with a breakfast sandwich which she enjoyed but her breakfast potatoes were soft and room temperature periodtoken   my son had a fruit and yogurt parfait which he demolished periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut he has the palate of a 20 month old periodtoken   adding to the soso experience was a burnt cappuccino and a bottomless cup of coffee that lacked any flavor periodtoken    so in summary room for improvement but fast service and filling food periodtoken","3295":"somewhere between fast food and a sit down restaurant commatoken culvers is a different kind of restaurant concept periodtoken  you order at the register and then sit at a table where someone will bring you food periodtoken  they focus on quality farm ingredients made when you order so expect a bit of a wait after you order periodtoken  the portions are very large and the ingredients definitely a cut above periodtoken expect to pay 810 for entree type items like huge hamburgers commatoken loaded roast beef and nice salads with fruit commatoken etc periodtoken  known for their shakes and custard commatoken like ice cream commatoken these items are popular as well periodtoken  they are very crowded so expect to wait commatoken but thats ok as it will take you quite a while to read all of the menu options and choose periodtoken      the drive through is an alternate option but still runs a slower than other fast food chains periodtoken  the quality wins out though so give it a try and just bring a little patience  its worth the wait periodtoken","3299":"when this restaurant first came to downtown boise i was very excited  food was good commatoken seemed fresh and somewhat healthy periodtoken we ate here several times and were quite happy periodtoken fast forward a year commatoken we ate here for lunch this past week periodtoken two of the three soups ordered lobster bisque  clam chowder were very thin and had little substance  w undercooked celery periodtoken togo cups were a little over half full periodtoken sandwiches were fine periodtoken hoping we caught them on a bad day periodtoken i may try them again one more time and will edit review then if things change periodtoken","3307":"good commatoken different menu some things are great commatoken like the pretzels and cheese and cheese soup others are a miss commatoken like the hummus appetizer and grain salad periodtoken  live music was fun but also louder than we expected at a 7pm dinner on a tuesday night periodtoken  great beer and great selection a lot to try more than you can get in stores  but commatoken we went for my sisters birthday and brought a cake commatoken and they charged a cake cutting fee per head  on top of added gratuity commatoken which isnt unheard of for a party of 15 commatoken but 19  the thought of asking her guests to pay and paying 50 more than the cake itself cost to eat it there was insulting so we just took it back to her house with us periodtoken so commatoken they lost points for that stinginess periodtoken","3318":"came down to 40th street to meet a good friend commatoken and parked right in front of tandoor india periodtoken  when he arrived commatoken i asked where he wanted to go commatoken and he pointed to the doorway right behind me periodtoken  auspicious beginnings periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken first impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment commatoken but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in periodtoken  i checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow commatoken red commatoken brown and rusty sauces commatoken all looking fresh and inviting on a cold sunday night periodtoken  the place was not crowded periodtoken  settling in commatoken i decided to take a look at the menu because i was not in the mood for a cascade of flavors and tastes commatoken but wanted to relax with only a few periodtoken  we were given copies of the take out menu commatoken which somewhat surprised me periodtoken  on the cover it said we believe that the joy of eating lies in the art of fine cooking periodtoken ill drink to that periodtoken we ordered tikka masala with chicken commatoken which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger commatoken and was quite good periodtoken the baigan bharta was tasty commatoken but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant i expected periodtoken  they cheated a bit on the garlic naan by bringing us regular naan painted with garlic butter periodtoken  it didnt work commatoken as it was not integrated into the bread commatoken but sat on the surface commatoken and lacked the baked garlic pieces i love in true garlic naan periodtoken  a disappointing way to pay an extra buck periodtoken the mango lassi was pretty good commatoken  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt periodtoken  a nice plate of rice came with the meal periodtoken   this was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food periodtoken  the strong brotherhood carried the day commatoken and the meal became background periodtoken  for the overall experience commatoken i was quite satisfied periodtoken we didnt solve any world problems commatoken but agreed we would get together soon commatoken and try again periodtoken","3330":"vietnamese food is one of my favs so i decided to drive a little further than i normally do to check out saigon upon looking on it from the outside it almost looks like an old wild west pub commatoken so dont be fooled like i was periodtoken passed it a few times ordered the pho and spring rolls with bubble tea periodtoken pho was good not great little bland periodtoken the spring rolls were pretty good periodtoken i think whoever made the bubble tea forgot the tapioca balls so they where placed on top of all the ice but after the drink melted a little bit it wasnt a problem periodtoken service was pretty good periodtoken overall commatoken not overly impressed periodtoken far from a bad experience but would like to see the flavoring develop a bit more periodtoken","3336":"frankly commatoken i expected more periodtoken  i had heard raves about how great their desserts were periodtoken  they certainly sounded tempting and they looked pretty commatoken but i just wasnt wowed periodtoken  portion sizes on the meals were a bit small for dinner commatoken but were tasty and the french onion soup was actually really good periodtoken  i resolved that i would return for lunch commatoken but probably not for dinner and id still always choose riddles for desserts periodtoken","3337":"my girlfriend and i went there for an early lunch on a sunday morning shortly after they opened up periodtoken i instantly noticed the dirty floor and the sticky table periodtoken once we sat down periodtoken then we were given the menus that actually had food pieces on them periodtoken i didnt want to gross out my girlfriend so i didnt say anything periodtoken food and service and price were all very good periodtoken its a shame they didnt clean the place otherwise i would have been happy to give them a fivestar periodtoken i assume that saturday night was busy and they just didnt clean up periodtoken","3342":"mad mex is fine periodtoken  we expect it to be crowded every time we gowhich is is periodtoken  the crowd is really diverse periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit seems to have a big college appeal commatoken but there are also several families and people going on dates periodtoken my husband summed it up perfectly the other day with have we ever ordered anything we really liked there  the food is expensive and mediocre at best commatoken but the drinks are pretty awesome periodtoken  we would easily go there just to have a margarita or sangria periodtoken  all the staff is very friendly and the bar moves quickly even when its swamped periodtoken  over all commatoken not a bad place commatoken but not the best either periodtoken","3345":"there is room for improvement in their customer service periodtoken  we called at 500 on a saturday commatoken but no one answered commatoken and no one returned my call periodtoken  so we went there periodtoken  the hostess told us there was open seating upstairs commatoken but when we got upstairs commatoken another employee told us the seats were not open seating periodtoken  so we sat at the bar periodtoken  they were out of three of six beers commatoken and they forgot my dates water periodtoken  that said commatoken the appetizers and beers we tried were good periodtoken  they had a sour beer on tap commatoken which is hard to find periodtoken  i think with more experience in customer service commatoken this place has a lot of potential","3350":"since they dont take reservations on weekends commatoken i wasnt terribly surprised that they had some difficulty accommodating 15 of us when we walked in periodtoken to their credit though commatoken we were seated at a 12top plus nearby 4top within about 10 minutes periodtoken  the outside beer garden was underlit once the sun went down commatoken and it was pretty loud once the band started playing periodtoken folksy commatoken bluegrass music food and service were good commatoken and i definitely recommend the beer biscuits periodtoken however commatoken be aware that desserts are all sized for 4 people","3354":"i havent been overly impressed with the food but i think its because i have pretty simple taste periodtoken the oj is really good but i wish they had lattes instead of just coffee periodtoken fruit and granola is tasty but had a grilled cheese that was really oily and heavy periodtoken","3356":"having no bags is really frustrating especially since their reusable bags are 23 and they dont even offer you to use boxes as a for of taking out your groceries periodtoken this place was recently remodeled and it is wayyyy too huge in my opinion periodtoken","3360":"so periodtoken periodtoken i needed dinner periodtoken periodtoken this place is close to home periodtoken a burger sounded like a good time periodtoken   the good  burger was yum el matador  they have a good beer selection  the staff is nice and attentive periodtoken   the not so great  burger and fries didnt come out at the same time  i spent 34 periodtoken00 for a burger commatoken fries and a beer periodtoken this included the tip i left periodtoken periodtoken but 34 bucks for a freaking burger fries and beer come on dude periodtoken   ill be back commatoken but for the lunch special which looks to be the best time to go periodtoken","3375":"ordered a burger and fries great tasting periodtoken the staff is straight and to the point you might even think there rude periodtoken they just come off that way periodtoken when you get there sit down and order  weather your taking out or eating there its faster periodtoken","3386":"after trying this place for their shaved ice commatoken which is by far the best ive had commatoken i decided to stop in for a light dinner one evening periodtoken i ordered the spicy green papaya salad and an order of shrimp fresh rolls periodtoken i really wanted to like the green papaya salad but it was served warm and had some flavor combination that threw me off commatoken maybe i disliked it due to my preconceived ideas of what i thought id be getting commatoken who knows periodtoken  the shrimp fresh rolls were standard and tasty but the peanut sauce was rather runny making it hard to get the flavor to stick to the roll periodtoken  ill continue to go for the shaved ice which is like snow from heaven in your mouth periodtoken go try it just for that periodtoken","3398":"slowest service ever  was not crowded at all so we picked a booth to sit at periodtoken  we were ignored for about 10 minutes and decided to move to another booth in the front room periodtoken  after a few minutes we were finally acknowledged periodtoken  we ordered right away as while we waited commatoken we grabbed out own menus periodtoken  after ordering commatoken it took another 10 minutes just to get the waters we asked for periodtoken  thank god it wasnt crowded because brenda appears to be the sole cook periodtoken  it seemed to take forever for our food periodtoken  once we got it commatoken i was actually pleased with my meal periodtoken  however commatoken because of the service alone commatoken i dont think i could go back and sit there periodtoken","3402":"this is my longest review because the service was pretty terrible so i have a lot to say periodtoken   my boyfriend and i had bought a groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner periodtoken this place is cute commatoken small and intimate periodtoken we were greeted by a women in a tshirt which i thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant periodtoken she sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it periodtoken we assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress periodtoken as we waited for someone to take our drink order commatoken it was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice periodtoken when we figured out what we wanted the women in the tshirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet periodtoken  my boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes commatoken so he told her we are ready to order when she was periodtoken she then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips periodtoken  we both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy periodtoken we asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic periodtoken she said she didnt know and just stared at us periodtoken my boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check periodtoken she informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didnt eat them periodtoken we ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla periodtoken the menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn periodtoken our waitress was very confused as to why i was specifying corn tortillas because she said we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones i wasnt going to argue because i wanted corn periodtoken at this point she still didnt take out drink order she placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so i asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said i dont know and stared at us periodtoken again commatoken my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us periodtoken at this point i imagine the owner or manager got involved periodtoken he said he would cook everything in olive oil commatoken and let me tell you the food was delicious we were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there periodtoken after the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate periodtoken i cant say enough about how good that mexican food was  i got the check and the bill was 30 periodtoken25 which was perfect because our groupon was 30 and our card could be charged  periodtoken25 so we could tip the waitress periodtoken i always tip regardless of the service commatoken some people have bad days the check came back of wrong commatoken not surprised and she took 25 off our bill so i showed her its 30 not 25 so i hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the  periodtoken25 difference periodtoken  she comes back the bill saying it was now 28 and we had no bill after the groupon periodtoken i explained i only had my card and i wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for  periodtoken25 periodtoken she stared at us and said uhhh commatoken i dont know my boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it periodtoken i did feel bad but my boyfriend even said commatoken she made the decision on not taking a tip periodtoken pros great environment               great food               byob               accommodating to food allergies if you asked someone other then the waitress   cons  the service periodtoken it was enough to not go back unless the manager agreed to let me take own order and personally give it took the cooks periodtoken also help ourselves to some water periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbecause the waitress wont periodtoken its a shame because the food has been amongst the best periodtoken it could have been our new favorite place periodtoken","3417":"well commatoken as with all things in life commatoken my opinion on local taco has somewhat changed periodtoken some of that was me just kind of changing my mind about things like flour tortilla tacos commatoken and some of it was the discovery of some pretty delicious stuff on their menu the enchiladas  all of them periodtoken i still would probably go elsewhere for tacos commatoken but for enchiladas commatoken this place does the trick periodtoken","3423":"we drove by this place and decided to check it out  periodtoken although its already  past their closing time 7 p periodtokenm periodtoken  commatoken some customers were still in there periodtoken so they sold  us a cup of halo halo periodtoken  it had all the goodies jello commatoken flan commatoken ice cream commatoken shred ice commatoken sweet beans commatoken  sweet  condensed milk etc periodtoken it was a   rich commatoken delicious dessert commatoken big enough for two people to share periodtoken next time i will come not too late and try other dessert treat periodtoken","3434":"tough crowd  coffee depends on the quality of the water periodtoken  here commatoken you might want to have it tested periodtoken definitely has an unusual aftertaste periodtoken  still commatoken it was potable and left no lingering aftereffects periodtoken    cant speak to the sweets commatoken but the bathroom was tidy periodtoken","3441":"the food was pretty good for quick serve periodtoken  they did get the order wrong but the customer service made the wrong right periodtoken salad was fresh  tasty periodtoken husband enjoy the buffalo wings periodtoken they were not the best but not the worst periodtoken","3463":"been there twice because it use to be right around the corner periodtoken  its not the worst place but their claim of making any flavor you can think of isnt exactly all that genuine periodtoken  the staff is young and cute and clean commatoken the prices are high periodtoken  id still rather go to shake shack commatoken even if its not as healthy periodtoken","3466":"the appetizers are so en pointe and amazing periodtoken sampler plate was fantastic periodtoken thats why the entrees were such a disappointment in contrast periodtoken  pad thai and clay pot were kind of gamey and over seasoned periodtoken  maybe other things are better commatoken but if i come back commatoken id stick with apps commatoken and order pork spring rolls commatoken crab rangoon omg pillows of amazingness commatoken and beef lemongrass periodtoken  the apps were 4 star commatoken the entrees were 1 star periodtoken","3482":"this is a pretty average place and nothing to write home about periodtoken the food is good but can be a little dry at times periodtoken service is not especially friendly or quick commatoken but management is visible and tries to stay on top of things periodtoken","3492":"whats up with your night well commatoken why not grab a classic tony lukes jerseystyle cheesesteak and hit up the bar connected to the bowling alley periodtoken   bowling alley cheesesteak chain with a dive bar okay commatoken i am cringing on the thought of how embarrassing that sounds for nj commatoken but regardless thats how the good old garden state represents periodtoken i met up with my group of guys and gals commatoken surrounded ourselves with our glorious looking cheesesteaks commatoken filled up on drinks and sat around bsing the night away at the bar periodtoken aw commatoken yeah a laid back night with food and my buds periodtoken  at tonys you can order cheesesteak substitution chicken steak available commatoken burgers commatoken fries and your standard fried grab and go grub periodtoken my cheesesteak was served on a fresh roll commatoken with american cheese that complimented the steak with fried mushrooms periodtoken with a handful of fries commatoken it was all washed down with a cold one from the inside bar periodtoken now commatoken it wasnt by far the best cheesesteak ive had but right square dead in the middle of good and average periodtoken  despite the sticky floor and fact that my shoes felt suctioned to the ground commatoken service was decent periodtoken the cashier takes the order commatoken lists your name and when theyre ready its announced on the loud speaker periodtoken the loud speaker shout out is clutch because there is no need to stand around awkwardly waiting periodtoken you are free to roam around and come or go periodtoken in the end commatoken dinner is served and without ever paying a bridge toll to phillys real tonys periodtoken","3506":"so periodtoken im a bit disappointed in this place periodtoken i actually really enjoyed blue bear and the crazy cocktails they had concocted periodtoken this place falls quite short of the old bar periodtoken the beer menu commatoken however commatoken is extensive commatoken which will be a draw for many periodtoken i had a decent beer after describing the to the bartender what i was in the mood for periodtoken i am no connoisseur commatoken so i definitely needed help deciding he was great for this task periodtoken i then decided to opt for a glass of wine as my second beverage periodtoken there is no wine menu commatoken he just brought out two bottles and i chose one periodtoken there was no discussion about price commatoken and perhaps i should have asked commatoken but i expected it to be in the 9 range commatoken which i would find normal if not a bit pricey at a beer bar periodtoken this is no tria commatoken so i wasnt expecting the 12 charge for the wine periodtoken it really rubbed me the wrong way periodtoken as i said commatoken i probably should have asked commatoken but with only 2 choices i doubted i would be paying that much periodtoken i probably will not return commatoken which is too bad because the beer list seems like a hit periodtoken","3508":"health food overload periodtoken this place looks and smells like the prototypical health food store commatoken which i do not dig periodtoken call me what you will commatoken but i like my health food disguised in pretty environs like whole foods periodtoken if im going to pay top dollar commatoken i dont want to feel like ive walked into a feed store periodtoken  there are lots of products for lots of special needs however commatoken i found that some things were more expensive than the nearby whole foods so unless i absolutely need something that only essene has commatoken ill likely not return periodtoken","3511":"went for the free beer tasting periodtoken you cannot go wrong with free beer periodtoken period periodtoken  the tastings apparently occur on the hour commatoken and are limited to the first 20 or so people commatoken so get there earlyish to pick up a free ticket periodtoken in the meantime commatoken pick up a notfreebutquiteinexpensive pint of something schlaflys their flagship beer is a great goto and sit outside periodtoken its a fun little trip with friends and doesnt cost much money  id do it again commatoken for sure periodtoken  only 3 stars  because the food is only ok periodtoken nothing special commatoken kinda greasy periodtoken","3517":"this was my first time to whitebox after seeing it in friends posts periodtoken upon walking in i felt that even though its very white and modern from a design perspective commatoken it still felt warm and welcoming periodtoken the employees working all had a smile on their faces and were pleasant to interact with periodtoken you order at the counter and then choose a seat and they will bring your food  drinks to you periodtoken the best part of my meal was definitely the latte periodtoken it was delicious and i liked that you could order a 12oz or 16oz periodtoken i ordered the quiche lorraine for brunch periodtoken it is served with a small arugula salad periodtoken the quiche is served room temperature commatoken but mine was cold like it had been in a refrigerator periodtoken i asked to have it warmed up and it came back at about the same temperature periodtoken it was ok commatoken but there is definitely better quiche to be had in stl periodtoken the arugula salad was entirely forgettable periodtoken i also ordered one biscuit with gravy on the side to try periodtoken the biscuit was a lot bigger than i was expecting periodtoken neither the eggs in the quiche or the biscuit were very fluffy  they were both much denser than i would have expected periodtoken while i enjoyed my overall experience i felt the food was overpriced periodtoken","3522":"cc is good commatoken great mocha service is exceptional great place to spend the day working or studying commatoken especially because they have cushioned seats  plenty of power outlets in the bench area periodtoken man they do keep it cold commatoken coldest coffee shop ive been to periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenive seen people leave cus they couldnt feel theyre hands periodtoken but it would make me buy more hot coffee   periodtoken internet is slow  not too reliable not expecting super speeds periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut they may want to update their router hardware periodtoken","3524":"its a nice store with great italian items however i cannot get past the fact that all the clerks at this place do not use gloves when theyre cutting the meats periodtoken this would not be a problem if they were not handling cash also but unfortunately they also handle the cash periodtoken this is very unsanitary and its really pushing me to reconsider continue buying from this place periodtoken","3525":"liked the atmosphere periodtoken great cheesy breadsticks and they sell not your fathers root beer periodtoken friendly staff periodtoken","3528":"stopped by for lunch we went to the wwii museum periodtoken food wasnt too bad periodtoken service was just ok since we had to carryout and put up the outside umbrella ourselves periodtoken","3530":"da vincis had a 21 prime rib dinner special going and since my husband and i are suckers for food deals commatoken we decided to try it periodtoken  in fact commatoken we went there for the same special 3 times periodtoken  the food and service was great commatoken  my only criticism is the yorkshire pudding that comes with the prime rib commatoken  to me yorkshire pudding tastes like a greasy pancake and this was no exception periodtoken dinner included soup or salad commatoken we opted for soup was very nice commatoken a butternut squash perfectly seasoned periodtoken seemed like a great deal so we returned a few weeks later periodtoken  on our second visit periodtoken periodtokensame food commatoken same great service but upon receiving our check we noticed that we were charged 3 for each bowl of soup periodtoken we asked about it and were told that soup is no longer included in the special commatoken not a big deal but it would have been nice to tell us that up front periodtoken  third visit commatoken  we ordered the same thing figuring that  even though the soup portion is small its worth 3 commatoken but when we get our check it is now 6 a bowl periodtoken  we asked about it and were told that its always been 6 periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenok commatoken so i guess we were hallucinating when we thought it was 3 the week prior periodtoken  in my opinion commatoken they should have continued offering the special with soup commatoken it just felt cheezy for them to take it out of the special unannounced commatoken and then double the price on a 2 ounce bowl of soup without notice periodtoken my only other criticism is that without a discount or 21 special the food is overpriced periodtoken","3535":"i had the elk burger

go over well periodtoken   all in all the food was good periodtoken service is was a bit slow and they forgot to make our shakes so we were there quite a while commatoken but the price is right","4089":"just went during lunch on a friday periodtoken not very busy and service was slow periodtoken the gal who waited on me was not friendly at all periodtoken however commatoken the food

better periodtoken","4108":"if i had only gotten the pastrami sandwich commatoken id probably give them 2 stars periodtoken  if i had only gotten the chicken bacon ranch sandwich commatoken id have

periodtoken   horribly let down by other reviewers who rated this place 4 stars periodtoken fish tastes like catfood periodtoken the kind of sushi you expect from the little teriyakisushi places in

fail within a year periodtoken    the gyoza and miso are delicious commatoken load up periodtoken   edit i let them know it wasnt great and they only charged me for one roll periodtoken otherwise this

periodtoken  it is ginormous with plenty of seating commatoken but i still often have trouble finding anywhere to sit and if i do find a seat it is absolutely no where near one of the three outlets in

when you finally get in commatoken they have a huge menu with a really overwhelming amount of menu options periodtoken  their sushi has been various degrees of quality and freshness commatoken nothing

your ice cream outside in that 100 degree heat periodtoken in addition commatoken the ice cream was completely mediocre commatoken i was expecting some wonderful ice cream and i was disappointed periodtoken i wouldnt be racing to go back and visit here if i was ever back in town periodtoken","4236":"food is solid and they have many unique options such as elk and wild boar periodtoken definitely check out their menu if you are interested periodtoken small portion compared to most burger places periodtoken the only downside is that the service is super slow  not enough

fabulous periodtoken","4297":"nice location and nice looking restaurant periodtoken  our waitress was good also periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken my husband and  i were very disappointed in the

mangia commatoken so you dont need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold periodtoken  that said commatoken the food was very good periodtoken i love to try the variety of lasagna in santa barbara periodtoken the largest portion commatoken but not the best is from arnoldis cafe commatoken trattoria vittoria when its done with lamb commatoken is my favorite but a big round of applause for tre lune periodtoken the bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned commatoken im a sucker for lamb ragu periodtoken this is the dish to beat periodtoken  while im disappointed at the delivery minus one star commatoken the food was very good 4 star periodtoken ill ding them today but certainly return for more lasagna periodtoken youve won my heart over trattoria commatoken and

latte and specialty drinks if youre around the neighborhood periodtoken they serve only breakfast and lunch periodtoken we came here for brunch and ordered fisherman omelet commatoken hangover hash commatoken and sombrero frittata periodtoken they overcooked the eggs as we wanted overeasy for the hangover hash commatoken but the spicy siracha mayo complemented the dish full of sausages and potatoes to add a little flavor periodtoken sombrero frittata didnt amaze me since it has avocados mixed into it and a side of toast that was a like biscotti periodtoken the dish was pretty bland and i was expecting avocado slices periodtoken fisherman omelet was a nice portioned meal but a little seasoning would be great my friend asked if it had came with toast commatoken the waiter said yes commatoken but none was served periodtoken","4373":"server was fun and quick at first commatoken when it was time to go she disappeared periodtoken    food was tasty enough periodtoken periodtoken

periodtoken periodtoken ceasar salad and french onion soup d periodtoken eggplant parm and gnocchi  the pinot gris commatoken was a 30 bottle from the wilammette valley periodtoken the funny thing about this was after we ordered it commatoken i could see them scrambling to find it periodtoken i almost thought they were going to come back and tell me they ran out periodtoken it did take a while for them to come with our wine periodtoken  part b periodtoken the cheese plate was aok periodtoken i liked the blue cheese and goat cheese commatoken but i found that there was hardly any brie for two people periodtoken whats up with that also commatoken the toast pieces were a little oily commatoken distracted from the cheese flavor and there should have been some variety periodtoken  for part c periodtoken the ceasar salad was pretty bad periodtoken they said they make their own dressing commatoken but i could barely taste it on the lettuce periodtoken i was also not a fan of the shredded cheese on there periodtoken it should be shaved imo periodtoken  the french onion soup commatoken however commatoken was solid periodtoken in fact it is truly vegetarian periodtoken so thats a plus    part d periodtoken the main entrees were both just ok periodtoken i did not love my gnocchi and am sure i have had better periodtoken even i prefer the gnocchi at mad tomato down the street periodtoken something about the flavor of the gnocchi was off periodtoken the veggies that came with the dish were nice though periodtoken   the eggplant parmesean was pretty bad periodtoken the eggplant was tough to eat and the tomato used was meh periodtoken overall the dish lacked excitement and i did not understand the green beans and potatoes that it came with periodtoken the potatoes by the way were very bland and boring periodtoken  there were some off things about their service periodtoken besides taking a while to bring out our wine periodtoken they took forever to bring out the cheese plate and then forgot to bring us plates for it periodtoken then since we were sitting very close to the door we noticed a lot of people come in and not be seated right away when there were open tables periodtoken on top of that commatoken when people would come in the freezing air would blow our way periodtoken brr  i dont think our waitress ever came by to refill our wine glasses commatoken but i think i was able to manage that one periodtoken however commatoken she was almost nonexistent the entire dinner commatoken which i didnt like periodtoken   overall commatoken the

while i was waiting in line commatoken i noticed that they offer 10 off your check if you check in to taqueria on facebook periodtoken  i did so commatoken showed the cashier my checkin on my phone commatoken and was given the discount periodtoken  i ended up getting the fish taco and the memphis pork taco periodtoken  the pork taco was the more dressed up of the two tacos with a bit of slaw and a red sauce periodtoken  i really liked it periodtoken  i liked the fish taco as well  good flavors commatoken but a little bare bones periodtoken  it had a good sized pieces of fish commatoken but other than that just some sauce and maybe three pickled jalapenos periodtoken  its not that it wasnt good commatoken but i felt like it looked a little naked periodtoken  my husband enjoyed a fish taco as well as a fried chicken taco and a brisket periodtoken  he liked the chicken taco and while he liked the brisket commatoken he thought that needed a little something more  he found it to be mostly just meat periodtoken  several people seemed to have a salsa trio as a starter it comes with chips and we think it would have been nice to have that to add to our tacos periodtoken  they dont seem to offer any salsa on the side though we didnt ask periodtoken    i would say these werent my favorite tacos of all time commatoken but they were very enjoyable periodtoken  this is a great place to stop for lunch or dinner in a very casual commatoken but friendly atmosphere periodtoken","4461":"i was excited to try this place after the excellent yelp reviews but was not as impressed as others seem to be  mostly because of the cost of my drink periodtoken i ordered an iced latte periodtoken the smallest size was 16 oz commatoken which was fine commatoken but i was charged 5 periodtoken29 for the drink periodtoken this seems very steep commatoken considering i like to leave a tip whenever i buy a drink at an independently owned coffee place periodtoken i walked out of tin comet with a decent iced latte commatoken but if im forking over more than 6 for a very basic espresso drink commatoken this isnt a place ill return to frequently commatoken if at all periodtoken","4466":"i really like this bakery because they are not highway robbers their prices and portions are a good value for the money periodtoken  i absolutely love their old fashioned cheesecakes  only 5 periodtoken50 for

periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbutter cake  i have been eating butter cake from philly my entire life commatoken unfortunately the two bakeries i used to buy it from closed periodtoken fritzs gooey recipe tastes very good but it is missing the cake bottom its all goo and should be called butter soup there is no cake periodtoken you have to eat this with a spoon or where a bib unless you refrigerate it and get it colder to thicken up periodtoken we bought five of them yesterday between the 3 of us and will never buy them again periodtoken i am on the hunt for a better butter cake  all in all commatoken fritzs bakery is a good bakery to go to  the prices are good and i will continue to be a customer but not for your butter soup","4471":"my husband and i trekked from memphis to st periodtoken louis at the beginning of april for the uswnt soccer game at busch stadium periodtoken we arrived in st periodtoken louis with a few hours to spare before game time commatoken so we headed over to a burger joint commatoken baileys range commatoken for lunch i had found it ahead of time via yelp commatoken naturally periodtoken this restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons periodtoken after fasting for good friday commatoken a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles commatoken french fries commatoken and an icecold coke sounded just right periodtoken the space itself was very neat commatoken with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas periodtoken there was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant commatoken which we sadly did not partake in periodtoken   the service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting commatoken so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once periodtoken   we started with the fried pickles appetizer periodtoken the batter was very good and i was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles periodtoken we then each ordered our burgers me  the basic burger commatoken my husband  the american burger periodtoken both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice commatoken but nothing to write home about periodtoken the standout dish was the french fries note  the large french fry is huge commatoken two people could easily split the smaller portion periodtoken the ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting  was there ginger in there who knows commatoken but it was good i would definitely recommend this burger place to anyone traveling to st periodtoken louis periodtoken","4474":"was there for the all you can eat crab legs on a weds periodtoken night with our family from the uk periodtoken  the

american cheese commatoken sweet peppers commatoken pickles and both spicy and honey mustard periodtoken pepper was also added periodtoken   what i unwrapped was essentially chicken flavored mayonnaise periodtoken the toppings and mayomustard sauce were delectable on the soft roll commatoken but i was really hoping that i had gotten more chicken periodtoken there are three reasons that could be contributing to my dismay periodtoken they could occur either in isolation commatoken or some combination of the three  reason one  the bottom of the chicken salad container periodtoken this area of chicken salad contains mostly mayonnaise and smaller chicken particles periodtoken   reason two  lunch hour periodtoken i was order 198 periodtoken the sandwich being called at the counter was in the 178 range periodtoken at this time commatoken i feel that the fine luncheoneers at this particular wawa could have felt the pressure of the lunchtime rush periodtoken   reason three  hoagiefest periodtoken im sure that everyone is familiar with our favorite three month sandwich discount periodtoken more recently commatoken the rolls moved from 12 to 10 inches periodtoken could it possibly be that this is solely a marketing campaign and not a celebration of the worlds fourth greatest sandwich  wild card location periodtoken there is not another wawa in this area for commatoken what in my estimation would commatoken be a 3 mile radius commatoken partially a manifestation of the lunch hour component periodtoken   two stars for wawa is a bit harsh commatoken so due to past experiences with the wawa chain commatoken they earn three stars periodtoken","4481":"i had a quad expresso this morning commatoken i really like this coffe shop periodtoken nice prople and great service periodtoken  better than my first visit but still learning to appreciate their blend commatoken","4484":"my husband and i found this place wandering around downtown not a whole lot going on down there

commatoken which would have made it better and when i tried it i thought the meat was bland periodtoken my salad was bleh and had tough chicken periodtoken i didnt like the fried pickles as much as others i have had periodtoken but the loaded fries were really good and we both liked our drinks periodtoken i was hoping this place was going to be better than it was because the atmosphere is fun periodtoken","4487":"if youre in it for the scene commatoken it doesnt get better than the french press in sb periodtoken if youre in it for the coffee commatoken go somewhere else periodtoken  i really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and i love supporting local businesses commatoken but their drip coffee is overroasted and way too bitter periodtoken hot commatoken iced commatoken it doesnt matter periodtoken its all super bitter periodtoken i wanted to like it so bad that i had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16oz cup of coffee handchosen based on my desired flavor profile periodtoken it took 1015 minutes to make and cost me 6 periodtoken it was terrible periodtoken so periodtoken effing periodtoken bitter periodtoken  to be clear commatoken im specifically talking about their coffee in this review periodtoken their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious commatoken but ive never tried them periodtoken thats not really my jam periodtoken so if youre like me and just want a regular coffee commatoken go somewhere else handlebar commatoken sb roasting co periodtoken periodtoken","4494":"this taco joint is highly rated on yelp so i gave it a try last night for the first time periodtoken i was a bit disappointed in my selections commatoken maybe some of the other menu options were better but i wasnt thrilled with what i chose periodtoken when you come in commatoken you place an order and pay commatoken then they bring the food to the table for you periodtoken it isnt a full wait service commatoken something inbetween since you do help yourself to beverages and condiments etc periodtoken there have a wide selection of bottled beers commatoken as well as margaritas and mixed drinks periodtoken i had read a review stating the margs were 3 commatoken but they were 5 periodtoken95 last night and i didnt see any advertisement for happy hour or anything for the weekdayswhich was a disappointment periodtoken  all the tacos are soft shell only commatoken which i guess is more authentic commatoken but not what i prefer periodtoken i did the daily special which was a chicken verde and also did a beanvegetarian taco periodtoken the chicken taco was overcooked and dry commatoken and the tortilla was wet and soggy from the verde sauce commatoken which i did not like periodtoken the ingredients seemed fresh but overall it was just not working for me periodtoken the bean taco was much better but still left something to be wanted periodtoken  i will say the the chipsguacqueso we ordered was awesome so thats a 5 star in my book but not enought to make me want to go back for food periodtoken if they had a happy hour i think it would be a fun place to hangout with friends for a drink and some chips periodtoken","4497":"tandoor is good periodtoken the buffet is definitely worth 12 bucks periodtoken theres chai and desserts as well as a salad bar periodtoken i got 2 plates worth of food and was very satisfied periodtoken seems like more of a take out or family style place but its always quiet when i go periodtoken the service is alright but since i get the buffet it doesnt really matter periodtoken the waiter still came by the table very often periodtoken this will always be my go to for indian food in philadelphia periodtoken","4500":"they have a wide variety of bubble teas  smoothies but i noticed they use powder flavorings periodtoken i wish they used fresh fruits and real red bean periodtoken  ive never tried their frozen yogurt although a glance at the toppings appear standard as that of a froyo type shop periodtoken  i stepped in at 830pm on a summer evening and there was no one at the counter to take my order periodtoken a lady finally walked out of the back room after 7 minutes or so periodtoken  overall commatoken it wasnt the greatest but i cant say its the worst periodtoken if you intent is to go for the bubble teas though commatoken keep driving about 6 miles east toward taiwanese tea house in castleton periodtoken","4507":"my 3star rating is really not based on anything periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i just wanted to post a heads up  i went there today to buy some chocolate for a gift commatoken and they were closed commatoken with no hours or anything posted in the window periodtoken i checked their website commatoken and it says they are currently only open every for private parties and events periodtoken   bummer commatoken because id heard great things and really wanted to check it out periodtoken","4513":"this location has struggled to find the right fit for a neighborhood restaurant periodtoken on the surface commatoken jp tavern could be the fit however commatoken management should focus on a few common issues ive experienced after visiting a few times periodtoken install sound panels to lower the deafening noise that echos throughout the interior periodtoken create some type of separation between the bar area and dining area periodtoken the kitchen is not getting the food out in a timely manner at all periodtoken scallop ap came out fast and hot commatoken but steak sandwich and pizza took a while and was luke warm periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenfries not hot periodtoken and please commatoken dont charge me 10 for half a martini commatoken please pour a real drink periodtoken if you have to charge more commatoken than do so we want you to succeed if possible commatoken find a top bartender in this town and steal himher away to work at jp tavern periodtoken","4520":"my first time to let them eat cake periodtokeni myself love cakes anyway its wasnt busy at all commatoken the service i have ever experienced periodtoken granted it was friendly service commatoken after we ordered commatoken it was a few minutes before our everything arrived which was cool periodtoken i went from hungry to moving past the pangs of wanting to eat periodtokeni must say my cake was good though periodtoken the cake we had were ordinary to be honest i  have had better period with a much shorter wait periodtokenbut its not that bad for me to stay away completey periodtoken","4536":"i am a coffee addict so anytime i see a new place open commatoken i am there periodtoken i just checked out the new old world coffee spot an california periodtoken  the good french press commatoken chemex show me these folks know their stuff periodtoken                 nice commatoken clean commatoken inviting space periodtoken                  the music choices created a nice ambiance periodtoken  the bad 12 ounces for 2 periodtoken50 and the cup was not filled more than 75 periodtoken also commatoken if i am paying for a french press commatoken i expect to wait a few minutes for my an actual french pressed cup of coffee periodtoken i was instantly handed the coffee so it must have been premade periodtoken  not one smile or acknowledgement of me as a customer periodtoken no eye contact periodtoken those are the things that for me make a coffee spot commatoken being made to feel welcome periodtoken coffeebar makes me feel appreciated periodtoken  i wish old world much luck and prosperity  periodtokenits a new

brave business folks who do the hard work in this difficult economic climate periodtoken","4537":"i am seriously going to ban myself from eating boiled crab from here on out periodtoken its just so bland but not as bad as eating snow crab claws at seafood buffets periodtoken that literally makes me sick periodtoken  23 for the 3 pound crab special that came with clam chowder and a caesar salad periodtoken it was the tiniest 1 periodtoken5 crabs ever periodtoken the first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means i pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws periodtoken barely any meat in the body periodtoken second crab was the same thing just cut in half periodtoken but whatever meat i did have commatoken it was fresh periodtoken ill give that to them periodtoken  kind of disappointed after this so i went home and fried up my own 3 marinated crabs at 3 periodtoken99 per pound periodtoken totally made up for it periodtoken","4540":"food is what youd expect at any innout periodtoken what i really hate about this particular location is that the drive thru takes absolutely forever periodtoken it could be due to the fact that this is the only one that i know of in the santa barbara area periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but still periodtoken","4548":"enjoyed the shrimp poboys periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we tried each kind and thought they were both good periodtoken the highlight was the lemon ice box pie commatoken so made up for the somewhat slow service periodtoken","4553":"i drove out of my way to go to subway commatoken but then i saw gyros and kebab nextdoor and had to try it periodtoken  the gyro was delicious and it was very cheap periodtoken  i didnt quite feel comfortable in the restaurant but i was happy with my meal one of the guys working there wouldnt look at me periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it might be a cultural thing with how men are supposed to be towards women commatoken but im not even going to touch that topic periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  anyway commatoken i might come back if i happen to pass by it and im hungry and have time periodtoken  lots of ifs though periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","4558":"we went with a group of locals to sample the custard after seeing reviews of this palce on tv periodtoken  i am a huge frozen dessert fanice cream commatoken yogurt commatoken custard periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut it was not as good as i had hoped periodtoken  boo  very sad to report this  i had the big apple commatoken as my friend recommended periodtoken  my husband had the brownie concrete commatoken and my two year old had a blueberry concrete periodtoken  a few things did not help periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe had to walk to the back of the parking lot to find a bench periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand it was hot and humid periodtoken  the treats were melting rapidly periodtoken  i have never had ice cream commatoken custard commatoken or yogurt melt so rapidly  kind of disappointing periodtoken  the flavor of the big apple was amazing periodtoken  the others were average periodtoken  maybe we will give it another shot on our next visit periodtoken","4565":"the long and short of this place is that the food deserves four stars commatoken but the service at most two periodtoken   their soups and sandwiches are excellent commatoken although most are at least as french or californian as they are viennese periodtoken  i lived in vienna for a couple of years and know what you find there periodtoken  the hungarian goulash is quite good commatoken being authentically viennese as opposed to hungarian in style periodtoken  i recommend it for chili lovers as a nice variation on the theme that most will like periodtoken   im diabetic and avoid sweets commatoken but the couple of bakery items that ive tried have been excellent periodtoken  my husband has actually raved about the pastries periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken if you eat here instead of taking food out commatoken the service is slow commatoken forgetful commatoken and apathetic at best periodtoken  ive had the wrong items brought commatoken soup brought lukewarm presumably because it had been served up and then was left sitting to await the rest of the meal commatoken and lengthy waits for the check periodtoken  this isnt some cultural difference between american expectations and viennese norms the viennese wouldnt find this level of service any more acceptable than i did periodtoken  my recommendation  if you want to buy stuff to take home commatoken this is a good place periodtoken  if you want to eat here commatoken better bring lots of patience and a good book or good company because you will need it periodtoken","4567":"delicious strong coffee commatoken gorgeous italian ceramic mugs commatoken great big windows  and changing artwork on the walls periodtoken   the croissants are incredible  periodtokenright off of rittenhouse square so if you cant get a seat or a table commatoken you can take your coffee outside periodtoken all and all commatoken one of the better coffeehouses in the city cheaper and immeasurably better than starbucks periodtoken  the only downside is the staff the baristas can carry a bit of an attitude at times periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","4568":"i first visited the barnes jewish cafeteria while waiting for a family member whom was having surgery periodtoken i stopped in just before the lunch rush to discover a wide variety of lunch options commatoken ranging from several selections of hot dishes commatoken sandwiches commatoken salads commatoken and more periodtoken i ended up going with a chicken parmesan entree commatoken which was priced at about 8 for a reasonable portion periodtoken seating is plentiful commatoken however it does get crowded during lunch so be advised commatoken after the lunch rush you might find others using the cafeteria to work while waiting on people at the hospital commatoken in fact i even used it to catch up on some work while waiting periodtoken   overall the experience was better than i had expected from a hospital cafeteria commatoken decent food commatoken reasonable options commatoken and a fair price makes this a decent option while visiting the hospital periodtoken","4569":"came here this morning for the first time  periodtoken good donuts commatoken not the best in the city periodtoken also way over priced periodtoken periodtoken i almost had a heart attack when she said 30 dollars for the dozen periodtoken i cant speak for the chicken though periodtoken","4572":"i am not pleased with this rouses periodtoken the staff could be a little more helpful periodtoken produce could be better periodtoken good price on coca cola today periodtoken","4584":"nice and clean commatoken friendly staff commatoken but food just wasnt all that good periodtoken id give them another chance though periodtoken","4597":"i gave the local taco a try for the first time today periodtoken  its cute commatoken and has a nice patio commatoken and i really wanted to like it periodtoken  i went during the late afternoon commatoken so there were only a few other customers in the place when we walked in periodtoken  i was warned ahead of time by the person i dined with that its a little bit expensive and it takes him a full order of chips  salsa  3 tacos to fill up periodtoken  i am not opposed to spending the money commatoken but i was really disappointed with my food periodtoken  i will say this commatoken i did enjoy the tomatillo verde salsa very much periodtoken  when i ordered my 2 tacos commatoken i was offered a lunch combo that comes with a side periodtoken  the refried beans that i got were pretty dry commatoken and seemed like they had maybe been sitting out a while periodtoken  it was late afternoon commatoken so it wouldnt be surprising periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i got the southern fried chicken taco and the smoked brisket taco periodtoken  the chicken came with almost no toppings commatoken so i covered it in the salsa periodtoken  the brisket taco just had a flavor that i didnt care for periodtoken  its a personal preference commatoken so others may think its fantastic periodtoken  it just wasnt for me periodtoken    the person i was with got the tequila lime chicken tacos periodtoken  it seemed to be the closest thing to a traditional taco they offered commatoken and its probably what i should have gotten commatoken as well periodtoken  after my late lunch i realized that i was expecting more options along the lines of traditional tacos commatoken when in fact this place offers just the opposite periodtoken","4611":"food is fantastic commatoken service is quite awful  call ahead if you can so you dont have to wait periodtoken  it took us 10 minutes to have our server acknowledge us once we waited 35 minutes for a table periodtoken  it took another 1015 to get coffee commatoken and were never given cream periodtoken we were given a pitcher of water commatoken but had to ask for glasses so we could drink it periodtoken  they are understaffed and we visited on a saturday morning when they were having a special event commatoken so they should have known better food was amazing and my fianc\u00e9 loved his coffee  we definitely got better service at the warrington location commatoken so if youre thinking about trying this place out i would say go to the warrington one periodtoken  they also have a better waiting area and full counter service area to get coffee while you are waiting","4619":"ive long admired the hotel mazarin for its picturesque courtyard because im often in the adjoining wine bar commatoken the exquisite patricks bar vin periodtoken ive spend many an idyllic afternoonevening here periodtoken ive also booked several of my colleagues at the mazarin when theyve come to new orleans and heard good things from them as recently as january 2015 periodtoken  so when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people i was leading commatoken hotel mazarin was at the top of my list periodtoken and when you realize that in other local hotels youre probably going to get that new orleans jenk known as charm  for a similar price commatoken i will absolutely recommend hotel mazarin for being immaculate with one tiny exception in my bathroom commatoken but im insane commatoken amenities almost westinquality beds commatoken flatscreen tvs commatoken and the restrained modern baroque decor gold fixtures commatoken marble floors periodtoken if youre a breakfastlover commatoken you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast eggs  bacon commatoken pastry commatoken toast commatoken cereal commatoken juices periodtoken seriously commatoken ive stayed in new orleans hotels with tvs straight out of the 90s commatoken ancient as in commatoken not antique beds commatoken dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness periodtoken i wont name names search my reviews if you must periodtoken but hotel mazarin boasts higher standards periodtoken   that said commatoken my colleagues and i had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted periodtoken   multiple reports of the front deskreception staff being aloof and often downright surly unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of new orleans periodtoken im honestly scratching my head over this one periodtoken one of my people was reprimanded for putting a room cardkey in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys werent working she never put it in her wallet but even if she had when she explained that she had done no such thing commatoken the response from the desk was an eye roll periodtoken another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy periodtoken with a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him commatoken he thought he could request a quieter room periodtoken he was informed that he was in a quiet room periodtoken thats it periodtoken no apologies or explanations periodtoken i can write more commatoken but in the interest of space commatoken i leave it at these two instances periodtoken   however commatoken all of the other hotel staff were great commatoken from management to catering special props to the lovely mary who took care of our conference room periodtoken she is a gem everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were all so lovely and friendly everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone commatoken making sure they were having a great stay periodtoken   the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didnt have anything hotter than lukewarm water periodtoken this is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in new orleans periodtoken i live here and i know the citys water pressure leaves a lot to be desired commatoken especially in old french quarter buildings commatoken but this isnt ok in a hotel periodtoken apparently there was some trick to get it to work and i cant even tell you what that is commatoken because its really that tricky periodtoken there should be instructions posted commatoken unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues rooms periodtoken   catering although the food is good commatoken its extremely overpriced for what you get periodtoken you are not allowed to bring in outside food commatoken so if youre using their conference room youre going to have to use these services periodtoken i know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms commatoken so although i wont fault them for this commatoken next year ill try and find an alternative periodtoken  related to this when setting up my catering order commatoken i specified that three of my group had dietary restrictionsextreme food allergies periodtoken for the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches commatoken i thought theyd at least offer a gf bread option for one or two of them for my gf colleague commatoken but no periodtoken second commatoken i was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not periodtoken suddenly i saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and i later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency benadryl periodtoken if he hadnt commatoken he likely would have needed to go to the hospital commatoken for his nut allergy is that extreme periodtoken if i put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines commatoken the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake periodtoken pretty simple periodtoken attention to detail is crucial periodtoken again commatoken when youre paying extremely high prices for catering commatoken high expectations should be met periodtoken  i would still recommend hotel mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city commatoken as well as the nice perks commatoken including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st amendment bar periodtoken plus its just nicer all around than other fq hotels in this price range periodtoken","4629":"maybe my expectations were too high with chef joe baldino being just named a semifinalist for a james beard award  best chef midatlantic periodtoken as others have stated the place is small commatoken fine periodtoken but its loud and thats coming from someone from an irish family of loud talkers  based on other reviews commatoken i tried the tagliatelli al limone which was overwhelmed by the lemon periodtoken it approached lemon pledge territory periodtoken my friend had the gnocchi which i tried and were amazing periodtoken this gave me food envy periodtoken   while offering desert the server knocked our bottle of red wine down my sleeve spilling 13 of it periodtoken fine commatoken it will come out of my black sweater commatoken but it was a goooood bottle of wine i expected the server to say let me bring coffee or a desert as an apology commatoken but we got nada periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken a disappointing experience periodtoken","4631":"this is the 3rd time ive been here and they are out of plain bagels periodtoken  how can you be out of plain bagels and its not even 1030 am","4637":"this place is like a fancy subway periodtoken  the staff was very friendly and attentive periodtoken  the clam chowder was a 3 out of 5 periodtoken  i also had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich periodtoken  it was a 2 periodtoken  very bland and i think the tomatoes were old periodtoken  i did like the chocolate strawberry periodtoken  it was a nice surprise periodtoken periodtoken","4639":"ive always liked this on the border periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken its like chi chis on don pablos commatoken with one major difference  the food is really delicious  its like every other mexican chain restaurant in terms of menu choices commatoken decor commatoken and presentation commatoken but something about the way everything tastes just makes them a cut above the rest periodtoken    weve also always had really great service every time commatoken so kudos to whoever does the hiring in there periodtoken  now on to the reason theyre only getting 3 stars periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken up until recently commatoken they gave you the option to build your own burrito periodtoken  every table was equipped with a pad of paper with all types of burrito choices on it for you to fill out however you want commatoken and you would then hand it to your waiter and be presented with your perfect burrito shortly thereafter commatoken no ifs ands or buts periodtoken  in my opinion commatoken probably the best thing they had going for them was this build your own burrito note pad periodtoken  boyfriend and i went there monday night and were devastated to learn that in addition to the menu changes mentioned by the previous yelper commatoken the build your own burrito option is now no more periodtoken    bad move commatoken otb periodtoken  bad move periodtoken  i got enchiladas instead commatoken and they were delicious periodtoken  but something about filling out check boxes and having full control over whats being put on my plate will be very sorely missed periodtoken","4644":"here is our back story periodtoken  do you have a little time to kill  good because its gonna be fascinating periodtoken  im gonna wow you with amazing tales of chili dogs and burgers periodtoken  no wait periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendont go  itll be great  ok well for those of you who stayed periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenheres my back story periodtoken  we were in the gsr for a pentatonix concert periodtoken  we had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the gsr is really bad periodtoken  so this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line periodtoken  luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into johnny rockets periodtoken  we asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker periodtoken  we ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter commatoken a classic burger for my wife and i ordered up the houston periodtoken i upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra periodtoken  the burgers coming out looked really good commatoken mine wasnt as good looking and was just fine tasting periodtoken  nothing to write home about or get excited about commatoken just a standard fare sort of burger periodtoken  my daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries periodtoken  she enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu periodtoken   our waitress daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly periodtoken  so if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling commatoken this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price periodtoken  the prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint commatoken maybe even a little lower periodtoken  parking isnt really that close because its inside the mall downstairs at the gsr commatoken but it is 1000000 times better than its old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long periodtoken    wondering how busy they will be when summer comes and the beach is open periodtoken  we will see periodtoken","4647":"i have been here twice and both times i left feeling underwhelmed periodtoken i love pastrami burgers and the apollo burger is just that commatoken a burger with pastrami on top of it periodtoken the burger was tasty and fresh but the pastrami was full of stringy fat i understand pastrami is fatty and i think it is an issue because if the thickness they cut the pastrami commatoken it needs to be much thinner or they have to use a better cut periodtoken overall their food is decent but if i was in the area looking for a good burger i would go to sax deli or jumbo and delicious periodtoken hopefully they can fix the issue with the pastrami because this is their signature dish","4652":"it was decent food commatoken but im probably not going to go there again periodtoken i just ate it and can already tell that my stomach is going to receive the repercussions for it haha periodtoken the staff was very nice and gave me no problems periodtoken","4662":"this is more of a fast food hot chicken commatoken ready in 10 or 15 min commatoken so there are some cooking shortcuts that make for a less succulent chicken periodtoken also commatoken the bird is normal size   a lot smaller than the giant ones at other hot chicken joints  so you may be disappointed in the size of the portion periodtoken it was 8 for a leg quarter commatoken a side and a fountain drink periodtoken  i got medium heat commatoken which is perhaps a little hotter than hatties periodtoken the seasoning was quite good periodtoken it wasnt an iwanttoeatmyselftodeath experience like youll get at hatties or princes commatoken but it was decent periodtoken  go if in the area commatoken because youll get a decent meal for about what youd pay at any fast food joint periodtoken  ill be back periodtoken","4664":"two star food and four star service periodtoken  went here for lunch today with the boss and a coworker periodtoken  tried the bbq nachos as the free checkin appetizer periodtoken  they were tasty  loaded with goodies and the bbq was good commatoken kind of sweet which i like periodtoken  after telling my companions that anyone who orders a veggie burger at a bbq place should be taken out back and shot commatoken i brilliantly ordered the soup and salad special periodtoken  caught some flack for that one commatoken but the chili was made with burnt ends which i theoretically love and i wasnt superhungry after the nachos periodtoken  did not like the chili at all  the burnt ends were just cubes of brisket and the pieces were too big to manage in a chili periodtoken  the caesar salad was good but the lettuce was a little on the limp side periodtoken  boss had the ribs glad i didnt order them because i could tell by watching him eat them that i would not have liked them periodtoken  i like tender commatoken juicy meat that falls off the bone into my mouth and just melts periodtoken  these looked a little dry for my taste and he struggled to eat them with a knife and fork periodtoken  we agreed that the best part of the meal was the little piece of cinnamon bread pudding that came on the side of their lunch specials periodtoken    service was spot on commatoken but we will probably stick to sugar fire or pappys for bbq periodtoken","4668":"lots of options here for lunch commatoken but there were some good takehome afterwork stores too in this upscale food court periodtoken  of course youve got some good sweets to take home with termini bros periodtoken and theres di bruno bros periodtoken for everything else periodtoken i also saw a produce stand with your basics and quite a few asian ingredients periodtoken  under the c was a seafood market clever play on words that sold premade food as well as fresh seafood periodtoken   see pics above of the shrimp offerings  we sampled their shrimp toast layered in cheese commatoken the shrimp nuggets were good periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey nearly sold out while we were waiting commatoken shrimp dumplings  coconut shrimp periodtoken    because it was the end of the day we got 50 the prepared food periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe seafood looked fresh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey had a good deal on skate wing when i was there but i cant say if the fish was overpriced periodtoken","4671":"pancakes are great with lots of options i would recommend not going during popular meal times periodtoken the line gets crazy periodtoken","4672":"i enjoyed my meal at the burger joint periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i got the burger they named after themselves because i figured it would be their best burger periodtoken i should have just built my own burger though periodtoken it was a pretty average burger in every way periodtoken if i could go back in time i would have got onion rings on my burger because while i was sitting there they served another customer onions rings in their burger and it looked awesome periodtoken  the french fries need work periodtoken i grew up on chip truck french fries commatoken so i always wonder why real restaurants cant cook a fry as good as the old man in the double decker bus in my home town periodtoken i dont know their fry preparation techniques but it seems like they are only frying them once because they are cooked but there is no crunch commatoken just kind of soft all over periodtoken i doubt i would go back because i am having too much fun following bacon hounds burger odyssey periodtoken","4676":"this cafe is a nice spot to chill and do some work in periodtoken  they have good wifi and a good variety of seating options to accommodate you and any friends that might be with you periodtoken  there are various dark wood tables inside and other tables outside periodtoken  the coffee i had was only okay commatoken so although id certainly try it again maybe the barista was having an off moment commatoken i may also commatoken instead commatoken try one of their other beverages periodtoken   there are tastylooking pastries and sandwiches available commatoken which i didnt try periodtoken","4681":"it was definitely not the best fried chicken ive had periodtoken the skin was not crispy enough and the meat was a little too dull commatoken not juicy enough periodtoken","4688":"this restaurant has a lot of potential commatoken but it feels like its having an identity crisis periodtoken  the menu is a mix of italian commatoken spanish commatoken and american dishes periodtoken  they seem to do everything well commatoken though commatoken but i wouldnt go here thinking that you can stick with one type of cuisine periodtoken  the cod fritters were great  nice and crispy on the outside with a bit of creaminess in the middle periodtoken  but the presentation was weird  they served it on a bed of french fries periodtoken  if the cod fritters had been presented on a small plate sans french fries commatoken it would have dressed it up a bit periodtoken  the bolognese and lasagna were both solid periodtoken  not over the top commatoken but like good home cooking periodtoken  the portion sizes were very generous for both periodtoken  they have an excellent beer selection  tons of belgian beers and plenty of domestic craft beer periodtoken  i love belgian beers commatoken but the beer list doesnt match the food periodtoken  i would definitely eat here again commatoken but it would be nice if the restaurant would pick a personality and stick with it periodtoken","4693":"great food potential and perhaps execution for some customers commatoken unfortunately not us  tonight periodtoken it was a very busy friday night periodtoken we arrived at about 540 commatoken did not get the burgers before 640 and were still waiting for the check at 715 periodtoken the second order of beer took at least 30 minutes periodtoken the place is loud periodtoken interesting ambiance commatoken kind of eclectic periodtoken bday parties  commatoken families commatoken not a romantic place periodtoken a place  you dont want to hang out in for more than an hour or you will leave smelling like fried oil periodtoken  wish the time was the only consideration in the 3 star rating periodtoken the service was slow and inattentive since all three  the burgers and the fires came out lukewarm to almost cold periodtoken we ordered medium cooked burgers and the bison was well done commatoken hard and lacked any of the described toppings except for a few mushrooms periodtoken so it was texture and lack of flavor periodtoken the aged burger was good periodtoken it was not quite juicy since it was not served warm but it tasted  good enough for a lukewarm burger commatoken i guess periodtoken my husband liked it a lot more than me periodtoken the fries are fine and the best part were the pickles periodtoken   the beer list is packed with local beer options for half and full pours which is kind of fun since one could try a few different beers at very affordable prices periodtoken the wine is considerably pricier and the list very limited commatoken almost discouraging periodtoken  i tried the red blend and it was underwhelming to say the least  too thin and too sweet periodtoken  we noticed other tables were served food before us even though we were seated a good 1520 minutes before them periodtoken   after speaking with management we ended up paying only for the beer periodtoken

burger arrived commatoken it came with a homemade pickle good and homemade ketchup fantastic periodtoken  now commatoken when i order a burger at an upscale ish burger restaurant commatoken i dont expect the burger to be large periodtoken   however commatoken i do expect an appropriate bun size that doesnt totally overpower the rest of the sandwich periodtoken  in this case commatoken the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the notsowellendowed burger patty periodtoken  i ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better periodtoken  all that said commatoken the sides commatoken shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger commatoken but barely periodtoken  i would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic periodtoken  unfortunately it wasnt commatoken and considering burgers are the main draw here commatoken the best rating i can give is an unenthusiastic 3 stars periodtoken","4706":"im a regular here periodtoken the nuggets are kind of dry but the bacon mcdouble is on point periodtoken the only bad side of this place is that the lines are long and slow

commatoken i lost money fast commatoken but after a change in tables commatoken i quickly recovered periodtoken   here commatoken they also have the onehand rule where you can only hold the cards with one hand which is just about the most ridiculous rule ive ever heard periodtoken they also were not lenient with sharing card information with other players unlike other casinos because it doesnt matter periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyoure playing against the house periodtoken   one of the hotel bars had a jumping 1980s crowd dancing like sardines in the small space commatoken while another bar had some live music with less than 10 people listening periodtoken there are dining options here commatoken but we only came to play periodtoken there was something for everyone at this

since they have such a great patio periodtoken  the patio is the best thing about this place in my opinion periodtoken    first of all commatoken it bugs me that i have to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant periodtoken  i realize that is common at a taco shop but it still bugs me periodtoken  secondly commatoken i asked our server for hot sauce when she delivered our food but commatoken even though they were not very busy commatoken i ended up having to go inside and get it myself because she forgot periodtoken    other than that the food was ok commatoken not great

price tag periodtoken   on to the food periodtoken everything here is served a la carte periodtoken most of the specialty burgers come at a set price commatoken but if you order the basic and add anything to it commatoken we found that you could be up another 4 or more just by switching your bun and adding a slice of cheese and bacon periodtoken you want a side of fries or onion rings thatll be a few more dollars periodtoken oh commatoken you expect silverware how much is it worth to you ok commatoken they dont really charge for silverware commatoken but you get where im going with this

periodtoken its served cold and mixed with dried cherries commatoken onions commatoken and balsamic vinaigrette periodtoken the onions were overbearing though periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken thats

commatoken and the transformation was drastic periodtoken pub and kitchen has been able to achieve lighting nirvana in their small space commatoken creating a warmth that filters throughout periodtoken service was quick and attentive without being overbearing periodtoken but on to the food periodtoken  i highly recommend trying the bar snacks commatoken which are a steal at 3 a pop periodtoken we sampled the duck liver pate and fish mop rolls periodtoken the latter were delicious periodtoken if memory and taste serve me correctly commatoken it was some kind of white fish combined with a creme fraiche accompanied by potatoes and herbs on crusty bread commatoken all of which is underscored by a hint of citrus periodtoken the flavors are sophisticated and complex periodtoken two large pieces come to an order periodtoken  entrees i was in the mood to go light commatoken so i ordered the onion soup 8 with a side of brussels sprouts 5 periodtoken what made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer i think to the broth commatoken which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet commatoken caramelized onions periodtoken my only complaint some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler periodtoken my side of brussels didnt achieve as high marks periodtoken the brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon periodtoken the flavors hit the mark commatoken blending well commatoken but the execution fell short periodtoken  we had also ordered the fish and chips commatoken an altogether unspectacular dish commatoken especially considering the steep price tag 1618 dont remember exactly periodtoken the chips lacked a certain crispness commatoken adding to the overall ineptitude periodtoken also ordered was the steak and potatoes 22 periodtoken not more perfectly could the steak be cooked rare commatoken au poivre commatoken and blissful periodtoken not as much could be said of the potatoes commatoken done in a hash brownlatke style commatoken which seemed old and overdone periodtoken  in all commatoken a pleasurable experience with exceptional flavor and ambiance however commatoken echoing other reviews commatoken the actual cooking has yet to find its groove periodtoken potatoes and brussels commatoken especially at this price point commatoken should be done without error periodtoken this has yet to happen periodtoken  to sit at the bar with a drink and bar snack before venturing out for the eveningyes commatoken this would be delightful and really the most prudent of actions periodtoken  ciao rwf","4925":"first time here  periodtoken great smoothies well done too periodtoken they have a great variety of smoothies periodtoken i think this is a place id comeback and well make me a smoothie fanatic periodtoken the persons working there were nice and cheerful periodtoken  my only complain and deal breaker are floors were dirty with water standing on the room behind what seems to be a storage  door was open periodtoken also commatoken the person preparing the smoothie washed his hands and dry them with his own tshirt periodtoken  i will recommend review this issues and present the store more appealing to consumers by following public health guidelines periodtoken  thanks","4933":"this johnny rockets location was on the bottom floor of the grand sierra hotel commatoken conveniently located next to the pool area periodtoken my husband and i came here thinking that we could use his promo points to help pay for our meal here periodtoken but alas take note that because johnny rockets is not owned by grand sierra commatoken the points do not work here periodtoken i wish we couldve asked first rather than find out after our meal periodtoken so minus 1 star for that periodtoken  i ordered the big pastrami pretzel burger and my husband ordered the blt chicken avocado sandwich as our entrees with a cherry coke float and banana shake to go with it periodtoken everything was amazing and delicious commatoken just as i expected johnny rockets to be periodtoken i only docked another star because the service was slow even though it wasnt completely packed with people periodtoken","4947":"pretty good but i wasnt blown away commatoken especially not for the price periodtoken p waitress was great thoughattentive and friendly periodtoken  wildfire burger medium rare  i couldnt tell where the wildfire descriptor came from periodtoken i couldnt taste any of the toppings did dig around looking for chipotle mayo and think i found it on the bottom bun periodtoken the meat was good and soft commatoken but the burger as a whole tasted mostly plain periodtoken  fries  crispy and hot periodtoken so good periodtoken i was able to split this with another person periodtoken  red curry catsup  tasted like how i thought sriracha catsup should taste periodtoken  regular catsup  i could have sworn this was the curry catsup because it definitely tasted like it had curry powder in it periodtoken  pistachio shake  pretty good with lots of pistachios the flavor was intense periodtoken  102314 my second visit here solidified my 3star impression commatoken although now its a pretty weak 3 stars periodtoken the coconut crunch shake was good commatoken but my classic burger was dry and plaintasting periodtoken i ordered it medium rare commatoken but it came out well done periodtoken gah periodtoken also did not get a side of regular ketchup with my burger this time periodtoken the waitress was nice though periodtoken","4949":"i love wawa commatoken but this one is only okay periodtoken the deli orders seem to be not as consistent as other wawas periodtoken i also hate the parking lot periodtoken if you come during lunch time commatoken its insanely busy periodtoken its difficult to pull out of your parking spot as theres always another car right behind you waiting to pull in periodtoken id rather drive over to the one in narberth periodtoken employees have always been friendly commatoken though periodtoken","4950":"im such a sucker for cute commatoken locally owned breakfastlunch spots that have health conscience options commatoken so naturally i have ventured to emerald city quite a few times periodtoken im really glad that its under new managment because last summer when i went there is was really disappointing periodtoken the last few months our visits have been promising periodtoken the wraps commatoken coffeee commatoken breakfast burrito commatoken scones and lemon curd are all very tasty nothing is ever over the top good commatoken but for coffee shop fare its nice periodtoken the staff is always really friendly and the dining space is super comfortable and relaxing periodtoken","4951":"santa barbara shellfish company is located at the end of the wharf periodtoken the view is simply amazing periodtoken we came here on a wednesday evening for early dinner periodtoken id say its pretty packed for a weekday periodtoken there was a 30 minutes wait for outside seating so we decided to take inside instead periodtoken   was craving for some oysters so i tried their oyster shooters periodtoken hmm definitely too sour for me periodtoken it was really just okay periodtoken i got their crab cake periodtoken came with onion rings and salad periodtoken my sister got their fried calamari commatoken shrimp commatoken scallops commatoken and oysters periodtoken also came with onion rings and salad periodtoken love their fried calamari and oysters   their foods are okay periodtoken service is very attentive and friendly  but i think this place is overrated periodtoken i would come back for the view and fried calamari periodtoken","4954":"i had a hard time with this one periodtoken most of the options were a little pricey and not a huge variety to choose from i mean commatoken 17 for a burger periodtoken i ended up getting the cajun catfish in a tomatoy sauce with rice on the side periodtoken it was alright but lacked some flavoring periodtoken several at our table got the shrimp poboy and looked like that wouldve been a much better option","4957":"the pancake plates are definitely a good value under 10 for the peach and the banana bread pancakes periodtoken however commatoken we did not feel that the pancakes were special or worth the wait the line wrapped around the restaurant even at noon on a wednesday periodtoken i wish the pancakes were fluffier and that the banana ones had actual slices of bananas with the plate periodtoken we thought the quality was on par with ihop periodtoken the sausage links were clearly not made in house frozen periodtoken service was friendly though commatoken and the price was right for a diner breakfast periodtoken","4958":"ok periodtoken so the pancakes were great periodtoken sweet potato periodtoken however the waitress was soo uninterested in us commatoken never asked to refill our coffee commatoken an had no personality periodtoken maybe she had a bad day and was tired idk periodtoken i am glad to have had the sweet potato pancake experience oh commatoken and dont forget your sweater as it was cold in here","4959":"cute place and the dragon tea i got with sea salt foam was pretty good not too sweet and i was afraid the sea salt foam would be too salty but was just fine periodtoken very thick foam and is a little too much commatoken but very tasty with crispy jelly added periodtoken this place is on the higher end of prices imo for just a boba milk tea but the ambience is super aesthetic and cute periodtoken only 4 stars because they didnt have half of their menu available lol but im excited to go back and try their uji matcha items when its in stock  update  still no matcha periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but tried their waffle puff cone this time around and its super tasty perfectly made cone thats super crispy on the outside and soft in the center periodtoken not too sweet so the cone with the ice cream arent sickening like other places periodtoken i also appreciate that the cone is cooled a little bit before the ice cream is placed in so its not all melts right away   sassy owner though commatoken not sure i wanna come back now ","4961":"the best the waitress periodtoken i wish i had her name periodtoken tall slender and woth long brown hair periodtoken she was charming and helpful and prompt periodtoken best part of my meal periodtoken  the good the kei tuna was so so good periodtoken i normally dont like tuna but wow that was so good periodtoken i ordered quite a few the inside is super beautiful and the colors are vibrant periodtoken and it had flavors that played well together periodtoken   the bad bland was a reoccurring theme periodtoken some of the rolls were ok but most where just absolutely flavorless mango tango or whatever was just foam periodtoken mango had no flavor and i mean lemon n spice are flavors but you cant run a restraunt on 2 flavors periodtoken   overall i want to give them another chance and i hope i will get some more flavor if not ill take a bunch of kei tunas periodtoken","4965":"when i walked in here i did so with every intention of reviewing it periodtoken and in my mind i said commatoken ive been here a few times and im pretty certain a 2star is the best theyll ever get out of me periodtoken  obviously this visit dissuaded me and gained themselves an extra star periodtoken  that said commatoken while the employees are extremely almost overly friendly commatoken the store still looks periodtoken periodtoken periodtokencheap periodtoken compared to borders or barnes and noble i feel like this is the equivalent of having a taco from taco bell rather than taco bus if you dont know what the means commatoken go yelp for taco bus periodtoken   my point is this its goodokaysatisfiesthecraving commatoken but when it comes down to it there are other commatoken better commatoken places that are just around the corner periodtoken","4972":"this is a great place to study or read the paper commatoken but especially on weekends you have to get there by 9 or 10 am at the latest if you want to actually get a spot periodtoken there are large tables to spread your things out on commatoken plenty of outlets commatoken and good wireless periodtoken theyre also open until 10 commatoken which is very commatoken very late for a neighborhood coffee shop and much appreciated periodtoken  its not a great place to have a casual conversation because most of its patrons seem to think its a public library and will shoot you dirty looks periodtoken  the coffee and food are decentnot greatand reasonably priced commatoken and the staff is friendly periodtoken","4974":"the decor is old and in desperate need of an update but the food is always consistent   the chicken tenders are the best in the business and what else needs to be said about the taters  just yummy  not good for you but omg are they delicious  the prices are a little higher than they need to be but its a nice change","4977":"indeed ive had better periodtoken the only thing that keeps having me come back is their heart attack appetizer periodtoken hooray for heart burn sarcasm","4979":"service friendly commatoken prompt commatoken courteous commatoken outstanding periodtoken outdoor seating sunny and breezy periodtoken  very comfortable periodtoken  kitchenware nothing plastic periodtoken all real stemware commatoken flatware and dishes periodtoken yay  lends to tastier fare and friendlier to the environment periodtoken   cold beer in a real glass bonus  downside the server recommended crabby bills hearty portions of grouper in the meals and sandwiches periodtoken  i was hooked then later disappointed to find this meager fillet dwarfed by a mega bun periodtoken  big expectation commatoken diminished value periodtoken    flavor fair for both meals periodtoken  grouper sandwich noted above philly chicken ok bun commatoken lightly seasoned smothered in cheese","4982":"downgrading here based on the service during our most recent visit periodtoken i brought in a party of 6 this time periodtoken i was looking forward to taking my parents and friends here after a fabulous visit last year periodtoken the problem was not the food we ingested commatoken but the food that was cleared and spilled onto our laps and the floor periodtoken my friends purse was almost slopped on commatoken my dads shorts were dripped on commatoken and i was constantly fearing for my face every time a server reached across to fill water or clear a plate periodtoken ive never seen plates scraped off at the table periodtoken periodtoken periodtokencome on really its a shame because the food is great but we will not be back periodtoken well commatoken maybe if they start to offer dry cleaning with purchase of an entree periodtoken","4990":"amazing food and drinks commatoken good coffee periodtoken but theres flies everywhere periodtoken i eat here pretty often and thats always a problem periodtoken","4992":"their food is ok periodtoken they give you plenty so thats good also they have fair prices  periodtoken and the atmosphere is good periodtoken service is ok  periodtoken very friendly people if youre in the neighbor hood stop by periodtoken why not  periodtoken nothing to lose  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but also nothing to gain  periodtoken periodtoken keep in mind ","4995":"the iced coffee is really good periodtoken i had the breakfast burrito commatoken which was bad periodtoken it was wrapped in a mission tortilla and was tiny periodtoken they used jarred tostito style salsa which ruined it periodtoken get the coffee commatoken stay away from the microwaved food","4997":"got the banana split commatoken chocolate glaze and mocha donut periodtoken chocolate glaze was very rich and i dont like too rich so it wasnt for me but the banana split was delicious periodtoken didnt really taste like a banana split commatoken more like a cream puff flavored with a lil banana but i liked it periodtoken its about 2 per donut","5004":"had lunch here the other day periodtoken  not bad commatoken but ive had better periodtoken the makhani chicken was a little on the tough side periodtoken  loved the chana masala commatoken saag paneer commatoken and the salad was crisp and fresh periodtoken the naan was ok commatoken but they didnt have mango or tamarind chutney periodtoken this was a major disappointment for me periodtoken nevertheless commatoken the ghulab jamun commatoken kheer and chai tea were all okay periodtoken","5006":"celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015 commatoken broad ripple brewpub is known as indianas first brewpub periodtoken  the brewpub looks like a typical english pub on the inside with dark wood paneling commatoken a tin ceiling commatoken and even a fireplace periodtoken  plus commatoken it has a large patio that can seat up to seventy people during nice weather periodtoken  broad ripple brewpub has a diverse menu and several of their own beers on tap to compliment nearly anything you choose periodtoken  they offer various starters commatoken salads commatoken sandwiches commatoken burgers commatoken pasta and classic pub entrees such as fish and chips and bangers and mash periodtoken  thankfully i scanned the entire menu as the very last item on it happened to be pizza    broad ripple brewpub has a few of their own pizza creations to choose from commatoken but i ordered a more basic sausage and pepperoni one periodtoken  my pizza ended being much better than i expected for something listed last on their menu periodtoken  the thin crust was cooked in a way that it allowed it to be somewhat firm but not charred commatoken and i liked that periodtoken  it had a good amount of cheese without me ordering extra commatoken and i also liked the way it was cooked to a golden brown periodtoken  the sauce and meats didnt stand out as much commatoken but there was nothing wrong with either of them periodtoken  if everything listed on broad ripple brewpubs menu before the pizza is even better than it commatoken then i need to have many more meals there and i recommend others do the same periodtoken  as a cheese lover commatoken i had to sample their cheese curds in addition to my pizza and will say that they were pretty tasty commatoken so i havent found anything i dont like on their menu yet","5008":"place is average wasnt to bad felt a little uncomfortable there","5010":"i cant understand how this place has such rave reviews periodtoken  maybe it is because i came in the middle of the day  maybe i have bad luck  maybe i checked into the wrong spoon me gps fail  anyway periodtoken the place looked so drab and actually dirty periodtoken the one girl who was working was nice commatoken but not so apologetic when she told me they were out of fruit and a few other things periodtoken  there werent many flavors to choose from commatoken or toppings for that matter periodtoken i must say though that the quality of froyo was better than that of the place in my town commatoken but the toppings were kind of sad periodtoken   i will be back most likely since it is near my work periodtoken expect to see better next time periodtoken","5013":"i know ted drewes is an icon and famous and everyone rants and raves about it commatoken but to be perfectly honest is it all that amazing  not really periodtoken  i think its pretty average frozen custard with standard toppings periodtoken  i do like some of their specialty treats like the big apple and the hawaiian periodtoken  but  the main reason for this mediocre review is their false claims about their famous concretes periodtoken  never do i have a worker actually flip my concrete upside down periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenprobably because if they did it would all spill out periodtoken  now commatoken i can grant them some reprieve if i order a concrete on a 90 degree night in july periodtoken  i can see why the custard wouldnt be hard as a rock periodtoken  however commatoken whats the excuse when i went in february and still got a half melted concrete  not worth the hype periodtoken","5016":"its something to do when youre bored periodtoken you get some beer at the end periodtoken we went on what was apparently the second busiest day of the year day after thanksgiving and it was still orderly and informative periodtoken not exciting enough to go again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","5019":"im not sure what all the fuss is about periodtoken  went there last night and had the coconut smoothie and it was very good periodtoken  then ordered the mapo tofu commatoken fried pork bao and the eggplant and pork periodtoken what a disappointment periodtoken  the tofu while a large enough portion had very little flavor  we ordered it with pork and it had maybe 5 little pieces of ground pork periodtoken  we kept adding spices and soy to get some flavor periodtoken  then while the eggplant had good flavor commatoken it was a bit undercooked and also commatoken wheres the pork  i have never seen less meat in a dish that advertised meat  never  the pork bao was ok but the bao part was a bit old and i had to pick the hard parts of the dough off periodtoken   i would not return periodtoken  thoroughly unimpressed periodtoken","5021":"owner tends to let the place get pretty warm inside before closing the front door and turning on the ac periodtoken i cant imagine how the folks working there must feel periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  if ya pull up on a warm day and see the front door open commatoken well commatoken you know what to expect periodtoken","5024":"this was our first time in zionsville periodtoken we drove around and thought the area was super cute periodtoken  this coffee shopbreakfast place has free wifi yay commatoken good strong coffee and some yummy cinnamon rolls periodtoken you order at the counter and seat yourself at any open table periodtoken  i got the veggie quiche is comes with fruit and the hubby got a breakfast burrito with chipotle cream cheese periodtoken i liked that the quiche wasnt humongous and they had quite a few veggies periodtoken the fresh fruit cup was also really good especially the pineapple periodtoken overall a pretty cute place periodtoken although this place has coffee and serves food they are pretty decent at both but not something unique i would drive all the way to zionsville for periodtoken its more of a ifiamintheareaiwillstopin kind of a place periodtoken i would give it 3 periodtoken5 stars if i could periodtoken","5035":"it is with great disappointment that i have recently discovered earls has removed their iceberg beers and they are no longer available for purchase periodtoken my friends and i often spend multiple nights per week at this establishment eating dynamite rolls which are top notch and drinking keiths icebergs periodtoken the iceberg is a staple in the prewhyte ave drinking scene commatoken and no doubt accounted for a large part of this particular business profit periodtoken i am not a restaurant manager commatoken but to me it seems like a poor decision to remove such an item from the menu periodtoken my vists here will be a lot less frequent indeed periodtoken a 5 star rating would have been well deserved if icebergs were still on the drink menu periodtoken","5036":"convenient but soo expensive commatoken and nothing is local except for some very awful pickles periodtoken periodtoken even in the summer time commatoken it would be nice to see more local commatoken small farm produce periodtoken","5043":"saturday night  3 of us 7pm and they are packed periodtoken  took the last table by the front door and suggest you dont if its chilly periodtoken  took a bit for a wait staff member to greet us but once they did things speed up periodtoken  pork belly tacos a must  wow commatoken  flavor for days periodtoken  lemongrass chicken verm and grilled shrimp bowls were amazing periodtoken  we ordered egg rolls that never arrived periodtoken so my assumption is they had staff call off and those that were there did the best they could periodtoken  my 2nd visit will be during the day periodtoken","5052":"my wife and i went last night for the first time because we are considering moving to seminole heights periodtoken  before i write a full review i will say the food was great commatoken but the service subpar periodtoken    the first thing we noticed as we walked in was a sign in sheet and there were only 4 names in front of us commatoken we figured it shouldnt take very long commatoken plus there are 2 tables open that just need to be cleared periodtoken  about a half hour passed and we were still waiting and only one of the two tables had been cleared periodtoken  finally after an hour of waiting we were seated periodtoken  soon after being seated we were able to order and the service got better periodtoken  as we were waiting commatoken we were never greeted or offered any kind of beverage which certainly would have raised my rating periodtoken  a suggestion would be to have somebody host and at least give you some idea of how long you are going to be waiting periodtoken  the noise level is very high because its such a large room and terrible acoustics commatoken so you have to talk at a high level periodtoken  the decor in the place is awesome with old vespa like scooters hanging from the ceiling commatoken old bikes commatoken toys commatoken coke signs commatoken etc periodtoken  the tables have toys and games on display under glass which is really cool periodtoken    now for the food periodtoken  great i loved the pizza periodtoken  we also had breadsticks commatoken great commatoken and a greek salad that we loved periodtoken  a small salad was big enough for two of us periodtoken  we got the the cappy that was new york style and would certainly recommend periodtoken  we will definitely be going back to try the chicago style commatoken but probably not on a friday night periodtoken   its possible that it was an off night commatoken maybe someone called in sick  it looked like there were only 2 waitresses for the whole place and it was a friday night periodtoken  overall commatoken mediocre experience commatoken great food commatoken and we will be going back to give another shot periodtoken","5067":"thumbs up for atmosphere commatoken ice cream quality commatoken kicking bloody mary commatoken creativity commatoken pickle concoction commatoken smell of baking buns and taste of freshbaked buns  thumbs to the side for extra chilly commatoken   thumbs down for cold oversalted fries commatoken homemade catsup commatoken fountain staff attitude sorority i hate my life  gourmet burger mission decidedly accomplished periodtoken  recommendations turn up the heat commatoken warm up and strip down the fries commatoken offer heinz for the lowly unappreciative among us periodtoken if youre going to charge separately for fries and burgers commatoken at least throw in my 2 tbsp of mayo for free periodtoken come now periodtoken   dave you did it again nice work periodtoken","5076":"this was our second visit to pjs commatoken but the first happened nearly two years ago periodtoken  i remember being underwhelmed back then commatoken and sad to say commatoken i still am periodtoken  there is a full bar commatoken with 5 or 6 beers on tap commatoken which was nice commatoken but the bar itself could have used one more television periodtoken  we were sitting on the opposite end commatoken and had to crane our necks periodtoken  my husband had a reuben commatoken which he said was very good commatoken and i tried the fina sandwich commatoken which had potential periodtoken  the fina was turkey and ham on a toasted roll with a nice honey mustard and onions periodtoken  the flavors were great together commatoken but boy was it salty  almost too salty to eat  we also split an order of fries commatoken which were ok commatoken but got cold almost immediately periodtoken  well probably give it another try during football season commatoken but this isnt a restaurant i would go out of my way to visit periodtoken","5082":"to see this beautiful building on the inside and to see it renovated was a real treat periodtoken the food commatoken beer and their own corn whisky was great periodtoken my only suggestions are to dim the ceiling lights periodtoken a little too bright periodtoken as for the noise periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i know that smooth surfaces are in but it causes too much echo and sound bouncing around periodtoken its too loud due to all the flat surfaces periodtoken","5086":"this acme is open 24 hours which is good for me periodtoken they have a section for gluten free products  other products through out the store are labeled a such as well periodtoken the beat time to go to avoid the long lines is definitely

products  have brought this to the managers attention in the past periodtoken make sure the dates are checked on everything before you pay periodtoken they are good with accepting returns but save

happy to have a new breakfast option in st periodtokenlouis periodtoken not sure why this place was so hyped for so long periodtoken not any better than any other place in town average at best periodtoken this establishment is way too small which im sure will be corrected when the average food and high prices take effect periodtoken now for the best part of the visit the egg was cooked perfectly 100 perfect periodtoken everything else was just ok periodtoken cant really tell if its out of the box or made from scratch periodtoken other than the window into the kitchen periodtoken i would definitely avoid this place on saturdays and sundays for the next 3 months because it is its like 15 people comfortably periodtoken and community seating sucks periodtoken","5091":"this is bakery has plenty of room to sit and chat periodtoken  it even has comfy chairs and a comfy couch periodtoken  the decor is simple yet elegant periodtoken    we went in their first week open and i was sad that two different things i ordered off their menu commatoken they didnt have made periodtoken       the coffee tasted great though and ohhhh the pecan croissant was fantastic  the best part was that we brought 5 babies in here and they were still more than happy to serve us d","5097":"it was almost midnight on a tuesday and we had just returned home from a full 13 hour day of traveling we were hungry and tired periodtoken instead of opting to go to a sit down place we decided to drive thru steak n shake periodtoken it had been forever since we had been to one so looking at the menu was something we had to do periodtoken i was hoping to get a chicken melt commatoken but i didnt see that on the menu periodtoken instead commatoken they had a grilled chicken sandwich and that seemed to be the only chicken sandwich i saw commatoken so i ordered it periodtoken my husband just wanted to order a burger with fries periodtoken there was a car in front of us so we didnt think much of it periodtoken we placed our order and were told to pull around to the window to pay periodtoken the car in front of us was still waiting so thats exactly what we did too periodtoken it took about 10 minutes for the car in front of us to get their meal and then we pulled up to pay periodtoken once we paid we waited for about 67 minutes before our food was ready periodtoken i guess its a good thing they cook our food to order commatoken but that was a long time to wait imo periodtoken we were handed our bag we double checked it for accuracy with drinks and were on our way periodtoken","5100":"had the crawfish omlet commatoken pretty tasty commatoken didnt make my toes curl but it was decent periodtoken was there at 930 on a thursday and didnt have to wait for a table

the drake was overflowing i decided it was time to give buckets a try periodtoken chill atmosphere commatoken lots of tvs commatoken good mix of folks commatoken and cheap arteryclogging grub periodtoken and yet commatoken the defining feature of the place  the one thing that came to represent our entire visit  was that it is a smoking bar periodtoken i figured that meant that some people might smoke commatoken but no commatoken that means that all the people will definitely smoke periodtoken a lot periodtoken too much for me periodtoken this joint was a chimney periodtoken   i thought about giving it two stars commatoken but that seems unfair commatoken because it is what it is periodtoken just because it aint my cup of tea doesnt mean i should give it a poor rating periodtoken for other people commatoken this place will certainly be a gem periodtoken if you want to smoke in a bar commatoken this place should probably get 4 or 5 stars commatoken because everything else about the place is pretty cool commatoken and there probably arent many other places out there that still let you light up periodtoken","5106":"totally decent joint for a quick commatoken fresh breakfast periodtoken  my wife commatoken the ultimate breakfast snob commatoken declared that her omelette was way better than mothers periodtoken periodtoken wasnt crazy about the blaring hip hop over the speakers but food was solid and they are open on thanksgiving periodtoken","5111":"im basing this review after visitig or attempting to visit pk several times now periodtoken  i will begin by saying that i find the layout to be pretty good with the exception of the back room periodtoken  something about dining there just makes you feel less connected to the normal energy and flow of the place periodtoken   the beer selection is small but tastefully chosen periodtoken  they always seem to have old speckled hen on tap periodtoken  ive never had a problem ordering drinks even on packed bar nights periodtoken  if youre eating at pk then you definitely want to have the burger periodtoken  its pretty ridiculously awesome periodtoken  ive had it three times now and it never disappoints me or any of the people ive dragged their with me periodtoken  ive had the mussels as well and they were nomtastic periodtoken  i have a feeling that all of their food is spot on and theres not a bad thing on the menu periodtoken  i knock them down a couple stars because times i have gone there it has either been so packed that it wasnt worth the wait or because one hot summer evening i tried to go there and either they werent running the ac or they didnt have any periodtoken  needless to say commatoken i had to leave periodtoken  it was just too hot in there to enjoy any food periodtoken  they dont take reservations which just bothers me periodtoken for me commatoken if i know where im going in advance commatoken i want to call and have a table reserved for me periodtoken  from the restaurants standpoint im sure they dont want to book up there tables for a bunch of no shows periodtoken  i guess its just crappy because i feel that their level of food is of the quality where i should be able to reserve a table periodtoken  i will make return trips periodtoken  its always a nice place to stop in periodtoken  maybe i just need to go some more periodtoken i really want to give it more stars commatoken i just cant right now periodtoken","5112":"its not a fancy seafood restaurant commatoken but worth a visit because its right at the end of the pier with beautiful views

periodtoken","5129":"got greek salad and spicy chicken wrap periodtoken was able to change tortilla style but wish they did half wraps so i could get half salad half wrap periodtoken fairly nice and quick service periodtoken will try three stooges wrap next time periodtoken a little more than i wanted to pay for food but thats to be expected with limited serving hours periodtoken food seems as fresh as a chipotle or piada periodtoken they did have smoothies and an array of salad dressings periodtoken dessert selection minimalonly had 2 of 6 desserts at noon periodtoken","5131":"very good donuts just loaded with lots of sugar  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but still tasty periodtoken periodtoken periodtokencustomer service was good  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken also seems

its cool atmosphere and ny style decor periodtoken i grabbed a king cake donut slice and a glazed and i have to say i was not blown away periodtoken   the glazed donuts are a bit more cakelike which isnt necessary bad but i think for the size there needs to be a bit more glaze on it periodtoken  te king cake had an interesting flavor to it which i though was just cinnamon but i think its a combo of other things that maybe i am just not used to periodtoken   good commatoken will go back commatoken but not 100 sold yet periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","5166":"going to rethink stopping here commatoken again periodtoken  we have been to several pieology locations and have always had great service and a great meal periodtoken  still got  great meal commatoken but their customer service

the process was went as planned periodtoken ordered a drink commatoken went to fill the cup and theres no ice periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni let the manager im assuming this know and he replies with yep commatoken its not working today periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken thats it periodtoken nothing else periodtoken a heads up when he handed me the cup would have been nice or a note on the

tell another customer he would refund his money if he didnt want to have all the extra liquid in his cup periodtoken      we love pieology periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwell just hold off commatoken until we travel further south for another visit periodtoken","5167":"coffee is usually hot  fresh periodtoken they love to upsale you with every order commatoken they ask you at least 3xs if you want hash browns or a donut  it gets annoying when you say all you want is your coffee","5173":"the coffee is alright commatoken not the best ive had but its inexpensive and does the trick periodtoken their cookies on the other hand are great order one with your coffee periodtoken the have an array of sweet baked good commatoken i didnt try them but they looked quite yummy periodtoken  the shop is small but nice with a few tables to hang outwork from periodtoken the people working there were very nice periodtoken the store front is easy to miss since but its on the corner of an industrial building periodtoken  my rating is mostly for the coffee but the cookieservice rating is more like 4 stars periodtoken if youre in the area this is a good option periodtoken","5175":"egggggghh periodtoken  some weird flavors periodtoken  would like to see a couple classics periodtoken  chocolate tasted funky periodtoken","5177":"i may get some frowns for this review commatoken but i really dont care periodtoken  i feel pretty generous in giving ted drewes three stars commatoken but it is just frozen custard periodtoken there really is nothing special about

to a nearby fritz or any other local ice creamcustard stand periodtoken  maybe because i didnt grow up on it commatoken having moved to the area a few years ago commatoken but i dont see what is so special about it periodtoken sure it tastes good commatoken but in my opinion commatoken there is nothing that distinguishes it from anyone else periodtoken its not terrible periodtoken its not great periodtoken its just custard periodtoken  that being said commatoken yes commatoken they do provide freebies if you are getting married periodtoken my wife and i swung by on our wedding day and they gave out whatever we wanted to our wedding party and the photographer too periodtoken good thing commatoken since it was the hottest day of 2010 periodtoken but the custard was just like it was on all other trips average periodtoken  so i would recommend stopping by if you are within a few block radius of the place periodtoken just dont make a special pilgrimage to st periodtoken louis just for ted drewes periodtoken you will be disappointed if that is the case periodtoken","5179":"two of us took a friend for his birthday last night periodtoken the lobster  bacon taco special was amazing i also had a southern fried and a fish taco  both great periodtoken the ritas were good too periodtoken  one slight negative with the experience periodtoken we sat down about 830 to eat so not extremely late in my eyes periodtoken at about 9 while we were eating commatoken a server came around collecting the candles from the tables periodtoken periodtokenincluding ours and other tables people were seated at periodtoken pretty inappropriate to grab away the candle from our table while we are still dining periodtoken definitely a ok commatoken time for everyone to get out of here signal periodtoken","5182":"new owner commatoken things have changed periodtoken drink menu has grown periodtoken havent tried many periodtoken i personally think the thai iced tea is no longer the same

know if that had anything to do with it periodtoken  theres a menu insert with newer items commatoken i would skip it periodtoken maybe some of the items are worth a shot but im too scared to try now periodtoken one night i ordered the chicken pan fried noodle to go and commatoken to my despair commatoken it was not what i expected periodtoken i dont know what happened commatoken in my mind the dish looked different commatoken even the picture on the menu was different periodtoken i even wondered if it was a mistake periodtoken imagine crispy deep fried noodles like the ones you put on top of a chinese chicken salad drenched in a sauce with barely any chicken periodtoken not the most pleasant experience periodtoken  for now commatoken im sticking to the egg rolls commatoken b\u00e1nh mi sandwiches commatoken rice dishes commatoken b\u00fan bowls commatoken and iced coffee periodtoken i wish the broth was tastier periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken dont usually buy pho here unless im craving a hot bowl of soup periodtoken i genuinely enjoy vietnamese cuisine and crave it often commatoken but some menu items here are a miss periodtoken i really like those places where the menu is small commatoken but you know everything tastes amazing periodtoken this place has variety commatoken but most dishes are mediocre periodtoken alas i still come here periodtoken its conveniently near campus and sometimes you need some egg rolls to get you through finals commatoken right ","5184":"this place is just plain too crowded every time i go periodtoken the food is pretty good periodtoken weve had some bad service issues twice where they brought all the food for everyone but skipped someone at the table periodtoken by the time they brought it commatoken we were finished","5201":"im

its definitely more of an older crowd periodtoken id go again commatoken if in the area but wouldnt go out of my way periodtoken   staff was really friendly and on top of helping periodtoken","5202":"i always hear about federal donuts and how you have to get there early periodtoken 10am on a saturday morning commatoken this location was completely empty periodtoken   the doughnuts are nothing special in my opinion periodtoken the texture was good but its just your typical cake doughnut that can be made at home if you had a fryer periodtoken they were all the same doughnuts with just a different sugar or glaze over it periodtoken i tried four flavors but none of them particularly stood out to me periodtoken  the fried chicken wasnt bad periodtoken it was moist commatoken but again commatoken nothing to rave about periodtoken it comes with a honey doughnut but i didnt get any pickles as stated on the online menu periodtoken i had a dry topping and a wet topping periodtoken for the dry topping commatoken i chose the coconut curry periodtoken it tasted more like regular curry powder dusted over the chicken with no hints of coconut periodtoken  and the chicken   coming from new york commatoken i think everything was pretty reasonably priced periodtoken","5219":"loved the turkey wrap with goat cheese and cranberries periodtoken what excited me the most was that they used real sliced turkey and not deli thin processed turkey periodtoken i was so very happy about that periodtoken this has become my new favorite place for turkey wraps and all things salad periodtoken on my 2nd visit i tried the tuna salad periodtoken loved all the yummyness they added like cashews commatoken grapes commatoken and cranberries periodtoken yes this is a great spot periodtoken the atmosphere is lovely periodtoken the service was great periodtoken lots of smiles periodtoken the beer lady was friendly and helpful periodtoken my first go with fat bottom ginger

landscaping periodtoken shame on you starbucks employees keep southport beautiful","5224":"i am new to the area and heard so many great things about this place periodtoken the first time i tried it commatoken i got the pot roast and mashed potatoeswas not impressed periodtoken then again commatoken i come from a southern family so its hard to beat home cooked periodtoken i decided to give it another try with a thai tuna wrapagain commatoken not impressed periodtoken thai food has so much flavor but this fell way short of what youd expect periodtoken the food is good commatoken but definitely not exceptional and not for the price periodtoken maybe a third time would be a charm","5226":"i like this place the staff is always nice periodtoken they dont take togo orders which is really inconvenient for people who work in the middle of the day and want to just stop by and pick up an order periodtoken they are kind of pricey compared to the hub commatoken which is a coffe place i love periodtoken  other than that the coffee is good and so is the food periodtoken","5229":"cheap and delicious food you cant go wrong with that periodtoken the food is good commatoken however they cook your eggs in a microwave periodtoken they dont really have a real functioning kitchen periodtoken  if it is busy commatoken dont be in a hurry periodtoken","5231":"apparently some sort of miscommunication on the coffee thing commatoken they have a new machine ready to go now im told","5243":"good niu ro mien periodtoken very flavorful with an emphasis on balance periodtoken noodle can be better but soup is very good periodtoken  rice with ground pork can use more fattier pork to further enhanced the flavor periodtoken but never the less it is good with flavor periodtoken siu xiao bing periodtoken the dough should be thinner periodtoken and a little bit too oily periodtoken crispy chicken with basil is very good very flavorful and juicy periodtoken  crispy pork cutlet has the right balance of salty and sweetness periodtoken  overall very authentic in flavor and i like it periodtoken why 3 stars because i am picky commatoken and they can have improvements periodtoken","5244":"the atmosphere is great drinks are unique periodtoken the reason im giving 3 stars is because i feel like the food quality had gone down hill periodtoken the last couple times i have eaten there the food has come out cold periodtoken i guess its better to go during lunchtime instead of dinner periodtoken","5252":"i love their chalupas and tacos but i have to give them 3 stars bc they have gotten my order wrong numerous times periodtoken","5256":"prep and pastry is just okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken a lot of hype good food  not great we will have to give i a another try maybe picked the wrong daynoticed it was noisy to a fault","5263":"food was very good however service is certainly not exceptional periodtoken  overall good place for breakfast and lunch periodtoken","5265":"i stopped in the past sunday evening periodtoken there were a few other groups there so the noise was ok periodtoken the parents had there kids under control which is also a plus periodtoken i ordered the crab cake appetizer commatoken shrimp bisque soup and shrimp ravioli periodtoken they did bring out the appetizer while i was still working on the soup commatoken but no issues after that periodtoken  the soup was pretty good commatoken the crab cakes were soso and the ravioli with 3 shrimp on the side were also good periodtoken the ravioli came with a sauce that was similar to the shrimp bisque periodtoken the total was around 30 including bread and a drink periodtoken overall i had a good experience and would go back periodtoken they must be reading these reviews","5267":"great atmosphere periodtoken the breakfast is good periodtoken just like at a diner periodtoken prices are high periodtoken service was fast periodtoken for the price i wanted something more than a diner experience although it was just breakfast periodtoken short hills is know for their lunches periodtoken","5274":"we wandered into broken beaker on a friday night periodtoken every other bar around it was full so i found it a little odd that there were only a few people inside what seemed like a really cool concept periodtoken i had a jolly rancher test tube shot and my husband had a tiny rick commatoken which is heavy on jalape\u00f1o infused alcohol periodtoken the bartender we had was nice commatoken attentive and gave us a lot of good information about the menu periodtoken we were sitting at the end of the bar though and employees were discussing their day to day like they were in a break room periodtoken there were some games on but no music so i felt like i was in the middle of their conversation periodtoken the presentation of the drinks was really cool periodtoken its nice that they offer distillery tours periodtoken i think with some small improvements commatoken this place could be a lot more on target with what they are going for periodtoken the ambiance could be a lot cooler with the science theme periodtoken some interactive projects or more of a lab feel periodtoken it feels like it hasnt quite committed to the theme periodtoken some different choices in lighting commatoken music and decor could do a lot for the place periodtoken we will go back commatoken probably to show our friends who come to town commatoken but the challenge is really getting past the show and creating a regular stream of customers commatoken which will mean creating a physical environment that people want to stay in periodtoken","5275":"this place is just ok periodtoken  the service was good and so is the decor but was sort of disappointed with the ny strip periodtoken the lamb osso buco was pretty good and so was the short rib appetizer periodtoken","5278":"3 periodtoken5 im some what torn on this  gluten free yes commatoken item specific commatoken clearly marked on menu dairy free yes commatoken item specific commatokenclearly marked on menu  first and for most commatoken i love the concept commatoken especially since paleo tends to lead towards more gluten free dining periodtoken it is important to note commatoken that like all most all indy restaurants commatoken they cannot claim to be gluten free as they dont meet a host of requirement and do not have dedicated kitchen space periodtoken for this reason commatoken they are gluten friendly periodtoken  tipshighlights   the welcome shot of olive oil is a nice touch periodtoken if youre unsure about it commatoken i would suggest taking small sips if you arent adventurous enough to chug the whole thing periodtoken   the menu broken up into courses commatoken as well specifically calls out vegangluten friendly options periodtoken nook also breaks out the paleo and keto geared options with the macros broken out periodtoken   the food was ok periodtoken the food was filling commatoken fresh commatoken healthy commatoken and filling periodtoken other than that commatoken there wasnt one dish that i had stole bites from other members in my party that makes me really want to go back asap periodtoken   the dinner wasnt exactly a quick periodtoken it was more of a prolonged experience periodtoken   initially they didnt have a reservation system setup when they first opened periodtoken they now use opentable which they list as offering limited reservations commatoken thought your guess is as good as mine as to how many tables they keep open for nonreservations periodtoken   cocktail bar they truly mean cocktail bar periodtoken no food service is provided   parking its downtown so parking can be a crap shoot in availability and cost commatoken especially when there are events going on at what its currently bankers life fieldhousename to be changed pending the highest bidder periodtoken   overall commatoken its nice to see a gfcf dinning option available in the downtown area periodtoken","5280":"first of all commatoken jeffersons is straight up sports grille food burgers commatoken fries commatoken wings etc periodtoken which is fine by me as i like that kind of thing periodtoken my meal started with their fried pickles recommend on the their menu which were some of the best i have ever had commatoken they have my highest compliments on their fried pickles periodtoken the burger commatoken on the other hand commatoken was not that great commatoken but not that bad either periodtoken in other words commatoken the burger was perfectly average periodtoken my one side commatoken mac n cheese was just average as well commatoken i have had better out of a box periodtoken   to sum up commatoken the fried pickles are a must have in this restaurant as they are fantastic periodtoken the burger commatoken on the other hand commatoken is perfectly average periodtoken nothing to special here commatoken but nothing bad here either periodtoken","5290":"this place is hidden away by the slots and against the wall towards the other side of the casino downstairs periodtoken  i wouldve never known that there would be food court there but pretty convenient i suppose since you dont have to walk all the way to the middle of the casino and up the escalator and down to the other side towards circus circus to grab a quick bite periodtoken  this place had asian food commatoken mexican food commatoken american food and a deli periodtoken  i couldnt make up my mind what i wanted even though the menu was very limited for each section but i ended up getting some beef chowmein which was pretty good periodtoken  its cooked to order commatoken so they make it there right in front of you periodtoken  my mom always get the shrimp fried rice and in my opinion commatoken i wouldnt get it because it was too plain my cousin wanted to add noodles to her wonton soup but the cook said no which i dont understand why when there was a bunch of noodles there and we wouldve paid the extra charge periodtoken  the pad thai there is definitely not the one you get at your usual thai restaurant either commatoken they just threw a bunch of meat together and stir fry it with vegetables so dont expect that tamarind taste with the peanuts in there periodtoken  the noodle soup looked plain too commatoken i think my cousins got the wonton commatoken which doesnt come with noodle and one got the chicken and i didnt hear good things about periodtoken  next time i come here commatoken i would probably just stick with the deli items or the beef chowmein periodtoken  oh they also serve breakfast here too periodtoken  the name says it all though commatoken fresh express food court commatoken so expect a little below mediocre food","5299":"husband loves the chicken burgers and i like the original burger periodtoken  we almost never go there commatoken maybe once a year when we crave for it

commatoken tasty selections for four pages not the twosided commatoken narrow piece of plastic laminate commatoken franchisequality flavored greasefood your restaurant now sells periodtoken your beers are still good periodtoken  no doubt the new owner bought your brewing recipes in the sale commatoken but your brewing competition in the st periodtoken louis brewing community is at least your equal commatoken now periodtoken  in selling your company to people who obviously know nothing about brewing or restauranting commatoken tom schlafly has replaced the art of the daring brewrestauranteur with passive commatoken soulless investors willing to phone in the spirit of a once great st periodtoken louis business story periodtoken three stars for the beer commatoken alone periodtoken","5306":"this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenexists its in a building alongside courtyard caf\u00e9 commatoken underneath a ucsb parking lot past the engineering building commatoken oceanside periodtoken its quite hard to find if you dont come regularly periodtoken  anyways when i ordered my beef a la carte im on low carb commatoken the cashier lady who didnt understand english very well tried to get my name for the order and it was a struggle periodtoken i had to spell out george three times before she just gave up and just spelt it as georte commatoken which was quite amusing in my opinion periodtoken at least after i waited for my name to be called commatoken she stopped the cook from swindling me by switching the kiddie sized petri dish and hooking me up with a big takeoutsized platter of beef periodtoken props for making up for the spelling mistake with lots of food periodtoken   back to the actual review periodtoken most people dont know that this place even exists on campus commatoken but all the engineering students like me commatoken do periodtoken even then commatoken expect long lines of engineering peeps and the seats being mostly taken periodtoken however commatoken the order was finished fairly quickly periodtoken   most of their items cost more than the panda express in the hub commatoken while portions are smaller periodtoken for example commatoken the takeout plates that i saw were about half the size of what youd get for a 2 entree 1 side panda express commatoken where youd pay 7 to 9 for most entrees commatoken or 5 for the a la carte that i got periodtoken   beef was pretty standard like other yoshinoyas commatoken its kind of oily without the rice and noodles commatoken but i like it greasy and tender as a keto person periodtoken comes with grilled onions periodtoken   decent place periodtoken filled me enough commatoken and the service was good in that one instance periodtoken i didnt like how the backroom chefs could be so stingy though periodtoken","5308":"i came here for brunch on a saturday and was underwhelmed periodtoken dont order the banana french toast i had to ask our waiter if mine actually had bananas in it commatoken and was told that bananas are in the dough periodtoken so periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was banana bread french toast commatoken which sounds amazing commatoken except there was zero banana flavor whatsoever periodtoken my dad had the blondie benedict commatoken though commatoken which was amazing periodtoken the rosemary hollandaise was

fine commatoken the ambiance was fine periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenoverall commatoken my experience was nothing special periodtoken if you find yourself in downtown stl and the more acclaimed

only been there once and even though i really like the style commatoken decor and everything commatoken the food and choices offered definitely had some room for improvement periodtoken  they did not have other options to whole milk and not many pastry options periodtoken","5317":"the beer and nachos are great here periodtoken however commatoken the service that i experienced while ordering nachos

for and oh before she even took our order we stood and watched her put away the meats from the other customer verrryyy slowly periodtoken it was super aggravating and ill tell you one thing commatoken if we do go back to this walmart for groceries we are definitely  skipping the lunch meat counter","5323":"maybe i didnt order the right thing i had a latte and it was decent but i couldnt taste as much of the espresso and tasted much of the cream from the latte art periodtoken my friends got the drafts and it was also just ok in my book periodtoken perhaps i would appreciate the pour overs more but one would expect all the coffee drinks to be solid in a coffee house periodtoken it looked like their drink menu was limited to pour overs commatoken espresso latte commatoken and drafts so none

periodtoken you get your moneys worth here periodtoken but if youre willing to spend a little more commatoken head a bit east periodtoken  also the biscuit was the best ive had in tampa periodtoken big and buttery commatoken this would be worth coming for periodtoken","5372":"i really want to give taj india a break because i really appreciate them for being there periodtoken northeast philly is desperate for decent indian food commatoken and taj is definitely decent indian food periodtoken decent periodtoken sometimes great commatoken sometimes kind of lacking commatoken but almost always decent periodtoken however as far as indian food goes ive had much better for the same or similar price within 2030 minute driving distance periodtoken   i never eat in the place commatoken its a little depressing looking and often with weird music playing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut its clean periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni just prefer home in this case periodtoken  oh commatoken they also have a wide array of indian desserts but i think they  might be too authentic for most americans taste periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot sure periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenim not into trying random sweets but thats what ive heard periodtoken  stuff i love about taj they make dosas but also do a good job at north indian dishes like channa masala commatoken fairly cheap commatoken call in your order and pick it up the food reheats fairly well in a warm oven or a quick dump into a pot on the stove periodtoken viola like new oh and its all vegetarian   stuff i dont love i have to ask 5 times to get enough mint chutney commatoken the sambhar is a little salty at times commatoken some of the curries arent that good dont do the black dahl go for channa masala periodtoken also the naans are really good as are a lot of the appetizers commatoken including the samosas periodtoken   all in all commatoken its a great find for the area commatoken but its sometimes hit or miss on some of the dishes periodtoken however the naan commatoken samosas commatoken and channa masala have been consistantly good periodtoken","5384":"i can say we have been coming to han d periodtoken for the past 7 years or so and have been very happy with our meals  periodtoken  we like the americanized menu they serve and the food is better than the other chinese restaurants in the area  periodtoken they do not get a 5 as i agree with other posters that each of the few employees have way too many hats to wear periodtoken at times i have to get up to hail a waitstaff member rushing by to get their attention for a question or water refill periodtoken hire more staff during busy times ","5385":"stumbled across the village pub  beer garden on a busy saturday night and decided the place looked hoppin so why not give it a try   walked into the busy bar and we were immediately greeted by a nice host who informed us that it was spot a seat commatoken take a seat type seating periodtoken it brought a competitive edge to our dining experience periodtoken he also informed us that it was a smoking establishment outside on the patio periodtoken he was very nice explained to us some beers and offered to get us one while we waited for a table to open up periodtoken   the ambiance was a little too college bar for me periodtoken very crowded commatoken loud commatoken and smoke filled periodtoken we patiently waited for a table that we were stalking to open up and swooped in when we saw our chance periodtoken they were either under staffed or overwhelmed with the crowd because flagging down a server was a difficult task periodtoken our server seemed too busy to explain to us anything on the menu or any beer we might want to try periodtoken that and it was almost too loud for me to hear my friend sitting just inches in front of me this was on the patio  when our food finally arrived it came out nice and hot periodtoken i had the bratwurst rueban and my partner in crime had the blackened chicken sandwich periodtoken all of their sandwiches come on pretzel bread literally a pretzel cut in half as bread which was a cool spin on a sandwich periodtoken they were both delicious and something different periodtoken    overall the pub was fine commatoken nothing special commatoken and no place to take a date periodtoken way too loud periodtoken if you are looking to get a few drinks and maybe it would be better not on a saturday night it seems like a good place to grab a sandwich and beer periodtoken","5397":"i had heard good things about this brewpub and was excited to try it periodtoken  first of all its very noisy so be prepared periodtoken  i was disappointed in the beer list periodtoken  we visited in the middle of december and there was not a stout or a porter anywhere on the list periodtoken  to not offer a winter type of beer during december i found to be very strange periodtoken  the food was not exceptional at all periodtoken  three of us ordered tacos and for 11 to 13 a plate we received only two tacos per order periodtoken  we ordered a side of fries at 5 and received probably 15 to 20 of them periodtoken  overall i was disappointed and would not go back periodtoken","5400":"went with the family for a late lunch periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendecided on baileys range over

easy mac with bread crumbs added periodtoken not impressed periodtoken   poboy bread was good periodtoken shrimp was not the same as the basket periodtoken more popcorn shrimp that nice sized periodtoken   no sweet tea  why periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken really periodtoken no seriously periodtoken why periodtoken   boiled shrimp appetizer had no cajun seasoning was simply just boiled with garlic commatoken very lack luster periodtoken   probably wouldnt come back but maybe its due to us coming when they had just opened for the day either way was not impressed periodtoken","5405":"i want this place to get better because its across the street from me commatoken and well id rather give them my money than walk down to phileo   however periodtoken   they need to seriously look at their prices commatoken because if mine was 2 periodtoken85 bucks commatoken and half price because it was opening week periodtoken thats going to be a problem periodtoken considering 1 i put 1 small plop of ice cream in my dish commatoken with 4 blueberries commatoken and 8 mms the cup itself theyre oversized wasnt even 13 full periodtoken so periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwell i think their price per oz may be a bit ridiculous periodtoken   i was there for opening day commatoken and alex is right commatoken it wasnt frozen yogurt periodtoken it tasted like ice cream and upset my stomach like ice cream usually does periodtoken   why would you put blueberries out with stems on them when you wash your blueberries commatoken is it not customary to remove the stems as the common ice cream goer does not intend to eat said stems  anyway periodtoken regardless of my howevers commatoken im bound to try this place again periodtoken as it is literally across the street from me periodtoken i want to love this place like i love little italy pizza and chapterhouse cafe commatoken but they need to find room in their budget for quality at decent prices commatoken that is how you will get repeat visits from me periodtoken so we will see what comes as time moves out from here periodtoken","5406":"the food was good commatoken and the atmosphere was that superloud sushi bar scene which some people like commatoken but really what stunk was the service periodtoken ive never tipped to crappily and i still feel bad about it commatoken but really he was terrible periodtoken the food sat under the hot light for a long time commatoken and lets not even talk about how long we had to wait for our check periodtoken there was no way we were paying with a credit card because that would have taken another ten years periodtoken  the funny thing is the bar staff was great periodtoken i felt bad not tipping more commatoken because i liked the staff at the bar periodtoken they kind of knew there was something up with the waiter commatoken at one point the manager yelled at the waiter after wed asked twice if we could pay

 the tomato soup may be the best i ever had periodtoken    the sammies were ok periodtoken  hers tasted like a quesadilla oddly enough periodtoken i guess that isnt odd since both are just vehicles for cheese periodtoken  mine needed something periodtoken  perhaps another cheese since the cheddar ended up pretty oily periodtoken  i know that is the nature of cheddar commatoken but watching oil drip out of your sandwich is not appetizing periodtoken    a glutton for dairy commatoken my friend also ordered a chocolate milkshake commatoken which was gross periodtoken  just kidding commatoken it was so good periodtoken  the staff was super friendly and more than welcoming periodtoken  they were playing the muppets movie in the corner periodtoken  i know that i should have paid more attention to my friend as i wont see her for months commatoken but it was the muppets and she understood periodtoken","5412":"girlfriend and i went here for a late night dessert on a sunday around 9 periodtoken the atmosphere was nice appropriately quiet periodtoken perfect date atmosphere without being overly romantic periodtoken  the service was good periodtoken  i had a cup of french onion soup which was fine commatoken but far from noteworthy periodtoken  between our chocolate tort and apple crisp commatoken neither of us was impressed with the desserts periodtoken  i wouldnt mind returning to give dinner a fair shot commatoken but will skip dessert periodtoken","5413":"i met family from out of town at morning call so we could catch up as i live out of state but grew up on the westbank periodtoken  i wasnt impressed to be honest periodtoken  for starters i had to put my own powdered sugar on the beignets which ive never had to do and i eat beignets at least once a year when im in town periodtoken  their beignets were a little fluffier than other places but ive had much better periodtoken  ill only come here again if its the only way to see family commatoken otherwise ill stick with cafe du monde periodtoken","5415":"i ordered the brisket meal to go periodtoken  the lean brisket portion was very dry and the fatty portion was just full of fat commatoken there wasnt a happy medium periodtoken  the brisket did have good flavoring from the sauce periodtoken  the mac  cheese didnt disappoint periodtoken  the corn bread was not what i expected commatoken a bit dry but enjoyed the spiciness periodtoken","5423":"what a cool atmosphere  commatoken the place succeeds in being post modern and cozy at the same time periodtoken   i liked being there periodtoken  i did not have the hamburgers which looked good and popular periodtoken  this is about the doughnuts periodtoken  if you really love doughnuts you will probably be disappointed in these periodtoken  there is a weird texture to them that is quite breadlike commatoken they reminded us of very plain kingcake periodtoken    they are very oversized  commatokenlooking like small pillows periodtoken  the basics were the best periodtoken  the cinnamon doughnut and the pink sugar one were the best if you accept that this is really a doughnut periodtoken  the custard filled and chocolate glazed seemed good at first but soon you taste that subliminal chemical taste of industrial strength custard and chocolate icing periodtoken all this stuff seems from commercial mixes periodtoken    it gets really scary when you get to the so called fancy doughnuts periodtoken  chocolate mint has a weird brown filling that tastes like spearmint toothpaste periodtoken  the thyme flavored was completely unedible and the peanut butter and jelly had a cheap canned jelly surrounded by fake whipped cream atop a doughnut filled with a weird peanut like filling periodtoken  on of my friends observed that they should have just sliced a doughnut and used real peanut butter and jelly inside periodtoken if you are not a doughnut nut these might work for you periodtoken  the people working there were so nice commatoken loved the place would go back  but as a doughnut lover  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni would never go back for  the doughnuts periodtoken","5431":"why 3 stars  my first visit was less than up to par periodtoken the second was redeemed by some great guacamole and awesome server periodtoken  the main food was still a little hit or miss with being greasy and slightly over cooked but i am willing to look past it as a slammed night and give it another shot periodtoken the flavor was good and i will be back to give them another shot at the elusive 4th or 5th star periodtoken","5436":"i came here for their happy hour periodtoken ive always heard great things about maynards commatoken so its definitely a place i would love to try for dinner next time periodtoken i got a cocktail called the heritage periodtoken it was mixed perfectly periodtoken the bartender got some skills periodtoken he was a great server as well periodtoken even though he had to walk all the way around the bar to help us commatoken he did it as often as he need to make sure we were take care of periodtoken the bar burger was huge periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenunbelievably youd think for a bar burger it would be much smaller but im sure it was their regular size dinner burger periodtoken chargrilled meat cooked perfectly commatoken squeeze in between tomatoes lettuce and chargrilled bun periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken yum the only surprising thing is there was bleu cheese that the boyfriend overread commatoken we dont like bleu cheese so we just scraped it off periodtoken otherwise it was good and we cant wait to try the pizettes and dinner periodtoken","5438":"this review pertains only to saigon market commatoken i will save the restaurant for another review periodtoken  this is probably my least favorite asian market in town and probably asian for that matter periodtoken  but they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then periodtoken    even though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the asian market periodtoken  you wont find rib eyes or filet mignon here commatoken but more rustic cut such as pork belly commatoken pork shoulder commatoken beef shank commatoken beef loin commatoken and innards periodtoken  the second benefit is the one male worker commatoken i think hes the butcher commatoken stocking boy commatoken and cleaner periodtoken  hes pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat periodtoken  if i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way commatoken hell be on it periodtoken  his english isnt very good but i think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for periodtoken   their vegetable selection is limited and caters to asian cooking periodtoken  out of all the asian market on lafayette road commatoken saigon has the worst vegetables   they always look like they are dead or near dead periodtoken   the herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh periodtoken  if you are wanting to buy vegetables though commatoken i say skip saigon and go to saraga or oriental market periodtoken   saigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like vans fish market periodtoken   check expiration dates especially on canned goods and i would be careful of frozen items as well periodtoken  i always make sure i do a thorough examination periodtoken    saigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits commatoken and you can find them scatter up by the register periodtoken  the owner usually stands behind the register commatoken she usually doesnt say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them periodtoken  i wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because i enjoy grocery shopping periodtoken  overall commatoken saigon would be a meh experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star periodtoken","5439":"a good second place when you are looking for a typical breakfast place downtown periodtoken  a little bit pricey commatoken but the quality is good and sometimes great  today i had a mexi moon without cheese along with a glutenfree pancake which tasted the same as buttermilk commatoken so good unless i didnt get my glutenfree commatoken cant be sure commatoken it was delicious periodtoken  that omelet was so delicious ill be back several more times to have it again periodtoken  very mouthwatering savory goodness periodtoken","5449":"i should know better than to try to eat a bagel in california periodtoken at 9am it wasnt empty commatoken but not busy periodtoken we were the only ones waiting for food periodtoken it took them 15 minutes to toast a mediocre bagel and put it in a box with capers commatoken cream cheese commatoken and onions commatoken prepackaged separately based on the 5 days prior date scrawled in sharpie on the plastic cup they forgot my tomatoes periodtoken not very cute for the momandpop vibe they have going periodtoken  barista was fast at least periodtoken good latte and cold brew periodtoken i should have just ordered a pastry though periodtoken","5456":"this review is only for their giant fortune cookies  i ordered a giant chocolate covered fortune cookie back in october 2013 because my fiance and i wanted a creative way to ask his uncle to marry us periodtoken  we thought commatoken what better way than to put it in a giant fortune cookie i typed out a personalized message when i was ordering the cookie but had some issues with the format of the message periodtoken i contacted their customer service and derek immediately addressed my concerns and helped me with my order  we were so excited to give my fiances uncle the fortune cookie a couple of days after it arrived it came nicely packaged and the fortune cookie looked awesome the message inside was also formatted exactly how i wanted it to look  the only negative thing was that the fortune cookie was not edible periodtoken we tried eating it and it almost hurt our teeth trying to bite into it periodtoken maybe i just got a bad cookie because most of the other reviewers cant stop talking about how amazing they tasted periodtoken it was slightly disappointing that we couldnt eat it but we all laughed about it and dont regret ordering the cookie  5 stars for presentation commatoken customer service commatoken and fast shipping 1 star for taste  chocolate was good but the cookie was as hard as a rock periodtoken  i would probably think twice before ordering another giant fortune cookie though periodtoken","5458":"i used to love trader joes periodtoken i started shopping  the w periodtoken 86th st periodtoken location

plan on giving it another chance and will hopefully amend our star rating in accordance  weve been waiting a while for a truly awesome cheesesteak in conshy and were hoping pontis delivers  our experience  we ordered take out and it was ready promptly periodtoken  their menu features primarily you guessed it steaks and spuds although they have many iterations commatoken and some very creative ones at that periodtoken reading their menu reminded me of reading the menu at rutgers grease trucks lots of items in a big commatoken fat sandwich in addition to steaks and smothered spuds commatoken they have hot dogs commatoken a salad commatoken shakes commatoken and a few other fryer made foods periodtoken i noticed they use liscios rolls the philadelphia standard so that is a big bonus periodtoken  i ordered simple figuring if they had the the basics down commatoken id try something new the next go around periodtoken my plain chicken cheesesteak with provolone had a great meat flavor lightly peppered commatoken but fell short in the cheese department periodtoken a dry cheesesteak is just a sin im planning on trying the whiz next time since the provolone was not a win periodtoken  my partner ordered a buffalo bill commatoken aka a buffalo chicken cheesesteak periodtoken this chicken steak was on point the perfect ratio of meat to roll with cheese and sauce mixed in periodtoken the whole thing was moist and flavorful and frankly commatoken i was jealous periodtoken  we each got a side order of fries periodtoken i opted for the basic side and really enjoyed them your standard boardwalk fry flavor periodtoken my partner paid 3 more to get a small copy cat cheese curds melted on top of fries with brown gravy and it was a disappointment periodtoken it wasnt what he had expected and not really worth the extra dollars for the flavors periodtoken  pontis commatoken were happy to have you in conshy we are hopeful that the kinks will get worked out and well get to

than starbucks periodtoken","5478":"maybe it was too high expectations commatoken but the woman who took our order  didnt know if the ribs were baby backs or not periodtoken  kale slaw was on menu but they didnt have periodtoken instead we got rice and beans commatoken which were highly bland and disappointing periodtoken the tacos were good commatoken but just good periodtoken the duclaw beer was fabulous commatoken and we ate outside on street not a pretty street i might add but it was less than 30 and it was satisfying commatoken but not exciting or amazing by a long shot not inclined to return periodtoken","5480":"ive been here several times because i live close periodtoken i love the rewards program periodtoken i get 1 off almost every time i go periodtoken i use to think this was the best froyo until i tried a really good place off of prytania periodtoken now orange leafs flavors dont have enough flavor for me periodtoken i still go because its a quick fix for my craving

was justin and he was incredible periodtoken we ordered some appetizers of the empanadas and brussels sprouts periodtoken both very tasty periodtoken our drinks were wonderful as well periodtoken we decided to grab a table and have dinner and justin was able to remain our server which we were happy about periodtoken this was at about 630 periodtoken we ordered our food around 7ish periodtoken two of us ordered from the devour menu and two did not periodtoken i saw our server ring our food in periodtoken we didnt get our appetizers included as part of devour until almost 8pm periodtoken we noticed not a lot of food was coming out so assumed maybe there was an issue in the kitchen periodtoken then as we were waiting for our entrees we noticed many tables who were sat after us getting their food periodtoken we were getting a little frustrated and quite frankly pretty hungry at this point periodtoken our food finally arrived around 845 by the time we got it commatoken it was too dark to even see my food periodtoken it tasted pretty good commatoken but the look of the food is a big part of what appeals to my appetite periodtoken dessert came with the devour menu and we ordered the churros periodtoken so commatoken all in all we left pretty disappointed commatoken but i will try it again periodtoken they were good and took our entrees off our bill periodtoken am i wrong for

really wanted to like this place since there are no thai restaurants to speak of on the east side periodtoken the food wasnt bad commatoken it was just okay periodtoken the spring rolls were average

i would go out of my way for periodtoken","5497":"i tried pomme cafe last weekend as its on my favorite street of restaurants in clayton periodtoken to start commatoken we had a great bottle of pinot noir recommended by the waiter and caesar salad periodtoken the caesar was excellent periodtoken next commatoken we had the burger which was probably the best ive had in st periodtoken louis thus far and the cavatappi pasta periodtoken the cavatappi pasta was lighter than i pictured and the sauce seemed nonexistent periodtoken for a sausage pasta commatoken it really didnt taste like much periodtoken if i go back commatoken i would order the caesar and burger again and try out the gnocchi periodtoken overall commatoken service was good and atmosphere is cute for a date on the quieter side periodtoken","5501":"good food and very fast service periodtoken  the shawny pawny and roasted red pepper soup are delicious commatoken however commatoken the soup wasnt piping hot personal preference and they lost a couple stars on portion size and value periodtoken  for an 810 dollar lunch you can get a much healthier portion of food elsewhere within walking distance downtown periodtoken    if youre in the mood for something light and not on a super tight budget commatoken check it out periodtoken","5504":"excellent burger place and very creative with their menu periodtoken staff is very friendly and accommodating commatoken and knowledgeable periodtoken esp the slim guy up front ringing the orders  commatoken he makes some great suggestions periodtoken u ask why only 35 i love everything about the place but i have yet to give a restaurant a 5 and 4 are scarce too and also cant its a burger place periodtoken if we r looking at only bar food commatoken this place is easily top 5 in my list periodtoken","5508":"first commatoken to get the bad out of the way periodtoken  no reservations  this disturbing trend by some new restaurants we really dont give a  if we inconvenience you commatoken we just dont want to mess with reservations periodtoken periodtoken is particularly an issue at the livery commatoken as even at 530 the bar was already pretty much full periodtoken  so you can try to squeeze in around the bar commatoken where the servers are looking annoyed because youre in their way you are commatoken or you can sit on a bench in the foyer not knowing if youll get a table in 30 minutes or 4 hours periodtoken  totally unacceptable in my book periodtoken  now the good   the food is awesome  as is typical of the cunningham group restaurants commatoken the menu is well thought out with latin american themed small plates and entrees periodtoken  we tried quite a few and they were all tasty with an interesting amalgamation of flavors and seasonings periodtoken  service was good commatoken with the servers well trained on the menu options periodtoken  so overall commatoken a good experience commatoken especially since we didnt have to wait too long commatoken but i wouldnt try it on a weekend after 6 pm or so commatoken unless your time is so unworthy that you want to sit around indefinitely for a table periodtoken","5512":"not enough granola on a 11 a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl periodtoken i asked for more and only got a small sprinkle periodtoken thats all that was missing commatoken a crunch periodtoken it was basically a smoothie

periodtokenor fun periodtoken the burger was mediocre  and thats because the brioche bun brought up the ranking periodtoken shakes were good commatoken  only saving grace periodtoken","5522":"service was good but i expected a bit more from the pancakes being they are the pancake pantry periodtoken  i definitely recommend their hash browns and hot sauce","5533":"the food here is hit and miss

sometimes bright and fresh commatoken but other times are soggy and boring periodtoken","5548":"went to baileys on a suggestion from my son after a cards game periodtoken there were six of us so we

pickles were perfect with a delightful batter periodtoken if you are a fan of jalape\u00f1os please order the chicken wings periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe jalape\u00f1o flavor is very prevalent periodtoken  as far as the burgers are concerned we ordered daves chop house commatoken  the gyro commatoken carolina bison commatoken and the buffalo periodtoken   the gyro was our least favorite mainly because it didnt taste like a gyro periodtoken the lamb meat was very bland and the cucumber sauce was nonexistent periodtoken   the buffalo was juicy and flavorful it tasted as expected periodtoken  daves burger was just ok periodtoken we were looking to taste more bacon but the rosemary was overwhelming periodtoken i ended up taking the meat and just eating it without the bread and toppings periodtoken  the carolina bison was the overall favorite just delicious periodtoken  we gave three stars because all of the meat was fantastic periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenfresh and awesome but we were disappointed in just a few things which took the score down periodtoken   1 periodtoken it was overly warm in the restaurant as though the air wasnt on and no ice was offered for our waters periodtoken  after a baseball game and walking to the restaurant it wouldve been nice to walk into a cool place periodtoken  2 periodtoken we all had ice cream and felt it was subpar mainly because it was melting so fast periodtoken i ordered the sweet sweet bacon shake and was disappointed when it arrived with no bacon  no explanation periodtoken 10 minutes after the shake arrived i was told they were out of the bacon periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmy whole reason for ordering the shake periodtoken the shake had a great flavor but im sure it wouldve been more awesome with the bacon periodtoken  3 periodtoken  the fries were below standard periodtoken when you pay 12 dollars for a burger you expect great fries to accompany that burger periodtoken the many dipping sauces were fine but these fries were obviously frozen not terrible but frozen periodtoken fresh cut fries to go with the extremely fresh burger wouldve been better periodtoken","5555":"the line is way too long here and the pancakes are overrated periodtoken the pancakes are okay but you then have to wait inside for food too periodtoken i got the blueberry stuff but its just a pancake periodtoken i think going to dennys or ihops is preobbaly just the same man","5558":"kind of a mixed bag periodtoken pretty pricey periodtoken the guac made table side quite

periodtoken  ive had vacuum pot coffee in various places around the us that offer it commatoken and this method was periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken unique  intelligentsia has a couple of videos on the subject guys periodtoken  just sayin periodtoken  still commatoken the fresh roast coffee and warmth of the place and earnestness of the staff make up for most shortcomings and ill gladly return to buy beans and see whats coming up periodtoken","5574":"yummy cold brew coffee  friendly staff periodtoken however prices are on the steep side and there is no ac periodtoken on a moderately warm day of 70 commatoken i was starting to sweat in the couple minutes it took to get my drinks i felt awful for the staff who have to stay in that sweatshop for hours periodtoken management needs to stop being so cheap and actually turn on the ac","5575":"the food is good but when i make a takeout order and im told 15 mins periodtoken and then wait for 30 mins periodtoken unacceptable","5576":"i go here at least twice a week or once any other week very polite depends on whos working periodtoken  most of the time the staff is very standoffish doesnt come over to check on table to see if we need anything periodtoken lady checked my 20 dollar bill to see if it was real periodtoken  even tho she knows my dad and i are regulars periodtoken","5578":"i have been here a few times this year and have

them commatoken i decided to try periodtoken  they came out golden and crispy on the exterior periodtoken  i broke one open and the smell of mold hit me in the face periodtoken  i tasted one to make sure my assumption was correct periodtoken  i told the waitress and she gave me the excuse that commatoken that is the way they are supposed to smell and taste bc the ricotta chz they use is not american periodtoken  wtf  the waitress took the barely touched app away periodtoken  i get the bill and they are still on the check periodtoken  i called her over to ask to have them removed and she says commatokenthe owner says you ate them periodtoken  now im a straight up person periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif i ate em commatoken i will pay for it periodtoken  she delivers the newly edited check back to me with an attitude periodtoken  that will affect your tip commatoken chica on the plus side commatoken the chuleta nortena pork chop was juicy and flavorful periodtoken  accompanied by the slightly sweet and creamy sweet potato periodtoken  the chipotletamarind sauce gave the thick cut chop a sweet and slightly spicy accent periodtoken  a must have periodtoken","5579":"the typical coffee house periodtoken coffee commatoken pastries and such periodtoken staff was ok periodtoken somewhat unprofessional in that they stood behind the counter talking loudly to each other about things not related to work or the task at hand periodtoken i ordered a frozen coffee what they call a mochasippi and a bagel periodtoken overall a decent experience commatoken nothing wrong periodtoken   just so anyone who may visit here knows commatoken parking at this location is terrible there are a total of approximately 12 spaces commatoken and 2 of those are handicapped periodtoken be prepared to hunt around or use the drive thru periodtoken","5585":"they need to use ube ice cream on their halo halo and not vanilla periodtoken  they need to use fresh tapioca to use in their sago  gulaman because those hard balls were disgusting in my drink periodtoken it should be soft and not old periodtoken","5594":"bagels are okay a bit expensive but the sandwiches choices are really good sure wish they had gluten free","5595":"ice creamery outside of the cobb theatres at countryside periodtoken  im giving this a 3 because the girl who tended commatoken sarah commatoken us was good but she was left to flounder due to poor scheduling periodtoken she was in the weeds periodtoken i felt bad for her periodtoken   the ice cream was good commatoken especially when she blended in the toppings i requested periodtoken but there was a line building up and there was only one girl commatoken a new menu and she was new there periodtoken she kept her cool and di just fine with us periodtoken","5605":"to my knowledge commatoken cosis sandwiches are all preprepared  commatoken so i never go in there expecting to be blown away periodtoken their food is edible commatoken and thats pretty much it periodtoken  i like to go to cosi for lunch and sit outside and catch a breeze periodtoken its a perfect spot for kicking it with friends or as a neutral meeting place for business acquaintances periodtoken   i like the tomato soup and the chicken tbm sandwich commatoken the hot apple cider commatoken the hot chocolate and teas periodtoken","5616":"pretty solid tourist trap type restaurant on the docks periodtoken a little bit overpriced for the food quality commatoken but reasonable given the touristy surroundings periodtoken","5617":"we came here because wed heard they had great desserts commatoken but that was not our experience periodtoken our entrees were quite good commatoken i had the lemon chicken with asparagus that was very tasty commatoken though a tad oversalted periodtoken  my husband enjoyed his burger commatoken but he had to ask the waiter to bring the wine hed ordered after wed already started eating periodtoken the desserts were so disappointing commatoken i got the crack pie which was supposed to be ooey gooey butter cake in a pie crust commatoken which was just sweet commatoken there were no other discernible flavors commatoken the butter wasnt even detectable periodtoken  my husbands key lime pie was better commatoken but still disappointing periodtoken","5618":"i really do like this shop rite periodtoken  the prices and hours are great commatoken and the service is generally decent periodtoken  the deli has usually has a special commatoken which is a nice surprise everytime like turkey for 3 periodtoken99lb commatoken and i always get samples of meats and cheeses to snack on while i wait for my order periodtoken  the bakery is usually wellstocked although the donut selection is not as fantastic as giants they do have the essentials commatoken though periodtoken  the store itself isnt the most wellorganized but it has everything at relatively low prices periodtoken  plus commatoken if you shop on a sunday morning commatoken they have complimentary coffee commatoken danishes commatoken bagels commatoken and cookies commatoken which is a really nice gesture commatoken i think periodtoken  ive also noticed that service has gotten a lot better over the years periodtoken  they also have an entire aisle dedicated to mexican groceries commatoken too commatoken which most other surrounding groceries stores dont have periodtoken","5627":"so the ice cream here is really great periodtoken the service on the ice cream side is always excellent commatoken and they are very kind to the baby i typically bring in periodtoken   the food side commatoken however commatoken is fairly lackluster periodtoken service is fine commatoken and its an alright place to stop in for a quick lunch periodtoken however commatoken nothing to write home about periodtoken the burgers are alright commatoken the fries are pretty good commatoken the salads are okay periodtoken   i am giving it a three for the ice cream periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken that keeps this boat floating periodtoken if the food matched the ice cream commatoken this would be a great spot periodtoken","5630":"there are defiantely certain times of the day i will not frequent certain fast food places periodtoken this rallys lunch is usually pretty solid periodtoken i really like the wings and fries periodtoken sometimes the buns can be stale and the meat overcooked periodtoken all and all not to bad for a fast food place periodtoken","5636":"excellent customer service periodtoken one of the few places in the airport outside of the gates that serves alcohol periodtoken i didnt try the food periodtoken drinks highly overpriced commatoken but you really have no other choice","5639":"this starbucks location is usually crowded and the crowds usually mean youre in for a long wait commatoken unfortunately periodtoken the drinks come out a little bit more slowly here commatoken and its tough to get a table periodtoken the layout works well commatoken but the place is small commatoken so theres not a lot of seating periodtoken  what i can say commatoken though commatoken is that i am usually waited on with a smile and a nice how are you today which makes the waiting suck a little less periodtoken nice staff commatoken long waits adds up to an aok in my book periodtoken","5640":"been twice periodtoken  once by myself on a sunny satruday late morning  sat outside with no wait and had a great salad periodtoken  went with a party of four on a saturday night in february periodtoken  were told there would be a 30 minue wait  sure commatoken no problem periodtoken  found seats at the bar commatoken got a drink commatoken and  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken waited for an hour and a half  but it was too cold venture outside needlessly commatoken so we waited and were finally seated in the upstairs dining area commatoken which we were initially happy about because it seemed quieter than downstairs and there were only 3 other parties up there periodtoken  until they turned up the music so loud we l periodtokeni periodtokent periodtokene periodtokenr periodtokena periodtokenl periodtokenl periodtokeny periodtoken could not hear each other periodtoken  or the waiter periodtoken  we politely asked him to turn the music down and after giving us a sourpuss look he turned down the music just a smidge commatoken like a surly teen who cant believe his parents are asking him to turn down his ohsorockin tunes periodtoken  other than that commatoken the food was great though no fish  chips on the menu  wah and the service was also very good i think the waiter realized he had been a bit of a jerk and tried to make it up to us periodtoken  in general commatoken this seems more like a local commatoken young commatoken slightly hipster hang out bar than somewhere you would make a special trip to visit commatoken so if youre local and in your twenties commatoken i say go for it periodtoken","5643":"i have been to this mcdonalds countless times commatoken usually on a busy morning where i need an egg mcmuffin periodtoken  i honestly only eat at mcdonalds less than once per month commatoken maybe once every other month commatoken because i dont love the food periodtoken  its junk fast food commatoken though the egg mcmuffin is actually a fairly dietfriendly option for fast food periodtoken  anyways commatoken i have zero complaints about this restaurant periodtoken  the food is standard mcdonalds fare periodtoken  the reason i felt compelled to write a review for a mcdonalds is the outstanding morninglunchtime drivethru crew  there is one employee in particular commatoken the one who usually hands you your food commatoken who is always cheerful commatoken helpful commatoken and smiling periodtoken  in fact commatoken i have called mcdonalds to tell them about this employee and let them know how efficiently the drivethru is during my busy weekday mornings and occasional lunches periodtoken  ive never had an issue in the past few years periodtoken  i hope mcdonalds knows what a gem that lady at the drivethru is","5648":"i just realized that if you goto the store on a saturday morning commatoken you do have slightly better selection in the fresh produce periodtoken but hurry commatoken they go fast there seem to be better crowd families and the seafood section seems to be alive now periodtoken keeping fingers crossed that it survives","5649":"my beau and i stopped here after a movie in cool springs periodtoken on a saturday night commatoken pretty much every restaurant in the area is packed periodtoken at this place commatoken the wait was 7590 minutes periodtoken since wed already tried a couple other places near the theatre commatoken we shrugged our shoulders and decided to wait periodtoken luckily for us commatoken we found a twotop in the bar area and were able to sit about 10 minutes after walking in periodtoken in hindsight commatoken im glad we got that spot cause if wed waited 1 periodtoken5 hours for a table commatoken we would have been disappointed periodtoken   the service was good periodtoken our waitress was very attentive and friendly periodtoken we ordered pretzel bread with cheese for an appetizer periodtoken my husband got shrimp tacos and i ordered the asian chicken salad periodtoken for drinks commatoken i had the lager and beau had a black and tan periodtoken the beer was okay periodtoken weve been to several breweryrestaurants and these werent the best beers periodtoken in terms of the food commatoken our mains came out before the app commatoken but when i reminded the waitress commatoken the pretzels came out quickly periodtoken beau said his tacos were pretty good periodtoken my chicken salad was decent commatoken but i didnt realize that the salad had a creamy dressing and a soysauce based glaze periodtoken it felt like i was eating a giant bowl of cole slaw with soy dressing and fried wontons on top periodtoken the pretzels were pretty good commatoken but the cheese sauce left something to be desired periodtoken im a pretzel connoisseur commatoken so i dont take this lightly wink wink periodtoken i prefer cheese sauces that have some beer flavor in them periodtoken this sauce was pretty tasteless and just had some salsa veggies on top periodtoken   would we go back yeah commatoken maybe periodtoken for that price range and atmosphere commatoken we would probably go to j periodtoken alexanders or brick tops periodtoken if we came back commatoken it would be for the service commatoken and to try some different dishes periodtoken and id get a cosmo instead if beer periodtoken","5652":"the staff was friendly and the service was fast commatoken but the food was mediocre at best periodtoken i ordered a simple double whopper combo periodtoken the fries were cold and stale commatoken the edges of the bun were hard commatoken and the vegetables on the burger were warm and wilted like the burger had been under a heat lamp periodtoken overall it wasnt totally inedible commatoken but i definitely expect more for a fast food place that charges almost 10 for a combo meal periodtoken","5654":"i like food trucks periodtoken   i like food trucks that have poutine periodtoken   i may just be a little biased here commatoken but alas commatoken i have found poutine in new orleans periodtoken   for those of you who dont know what poutine is commatoken its actually a canadian dish originating in quebec periodtoken  it is composed of fries commatoken with cheese curds that are sprinkled on top and they melt into a gooey mess as brown gravy is poured onto it periodtoken  its a heart attack in a cup periodtoken  back home in canada commatoken they have a a lot of different variations of poutines commatoken and there are specialty poutine shops periodtoken i often think about poutine commatoken so i was especially excited when i saw it on foodie calls menu as they were setting up periodtoken  i was so excited commatoken i couldnt wait and i ordered it immediately commatoken i had to wait about 20 minutes for the poutine because they hadnt even started up their burners yet periodtoken  although it didnt taste like home commatoken the poutine was still good in its own new orleans way periodtoken  a little bit of seasoned fries commatoken gravy with debris commatoken and cheese curds periodtoken  cheese curds werent quite melted into a gooey mess commatoken they were still sort of square and not totally soft periodtoken  plus side commatoken i know where i can poutine for my cravings commatoken i just have to chase this truck down commatoken and now i also know where i can get cheese curds in this city periodtoken  as we all know the grocery stores dont carry them periodtoken","5657":"not bad commatoken not so spectacular either periodtoken a local version of panera bread commatoken and slightly better periodtoken salads are good commatoken a few east coast sandwiches periodtoken","5662":"ended up here on a friday just as a walk in periodtoken  we were able to get seated immediately which isnt easy for media but were brought into this tiny room in the basement with no windows and so full of tables they have to be breaking a fire code periodtoken  the food was really good commatoken but we couldnt really have a conversation because the sound from the 16 other people shoved into the 10 by 10 cement room was so loud periodtoken    id definitely go back because all four of us had outstanding meals but insist on not sitting in that room of lost souls or just people without reservations periodtoken","5665":"decided to give this place a try after i was craving a good cuban periodtoken my goto cuban spot is big steins down the road commatoken but wanted to try something new periodtoken they definitely have a lot of options and is a a very cute restaurant periodtoken i got the lunch special which was the hot honey turkey wrap pressed periodtoken i was kind of confused when my bill came out to 10 when the lunch special was 6 periodtoken99 commatoken but im assuming thats because i got the soup as my side periodtoken the soup commatoken by the way commatoken was cold periodtoken its just an assumption that my soup would be hot commatoken because well its soup so that was disappointing periodtoken i will give this place another try for breakfast  seemed like they had a lot of good options and its served all day periodtoken my wrap was good but didnt have enough turkey periodtoken","5667":"the ambience is nice and there are several small touches making the service nice periodtoken  i had the veggie quesadilla with zucchini and it was good commatoken  not super flavorful commatoken  but still good periodtoken the salsa is tasty   the beans delivered with the meal in one little bowl to a booth of 6 people is strange and no one even touched them periodtoken  either deliver with the chips and salsa and more than one bowl for booth of 6 easier logistics to share or skip periodtoken","5669":"a gaybourhood institution used to be a lot more fun periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken now rather tired periodtoken    the food is rather decent commatoken though a pit pricey periodtoken  i do like that one can order a salad with a burger rather than fries periodtoken  the guacamole is an embarrassment commatoken but as a whole everything is ok periodtoken  its the server that will make or break the experience periodtoken  there is this one chap that has been there for ages and i reckon its because he gives the guys who frequent the place something to salivate over periodtoken  i for one am more impressed with my servers work ethic than looks periodtoken    one one occasion commatoken i asked for more napkins periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken didnt get them commatoken another time needed an extra fork periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken not happening either periodtoken  never got a refill on iced tea periodtoken  i once had to even ask the other server for the check because apparently he didnt feel like getting that for us either periodtoken    if you get any other server commatoken youll have a decent experience as none of the others have as much tude periodtoken   still commatoken there are better places out there periodtoken","5677":"reasonably priced commatoken laid back commatoken easy periodtoken i prefer my tacos with corn tortillas commatoken so really these are burritos with flour tortillas if you wanna get technical periodtoken  good sangria periodtoken loved the buffalo chicken taco innards periodtoken nice people periodtoken","5686":"its okay commatoken we went on a busy saturday night and while the place was busy it wasnt packed solid periodtoken  the food was bland commatoken and my dish was dry as a bone not even a sauce to help things periodtoken  the only saving grace was the beer periodtoken  i would give it another try next year when we come back but only if we run out of other places to go periodtoken","5691":"i loved my server commatoken she was very good periodtoken this place has a nice atmosphere commatoken love the decorations and the bathroom is adorable periodtoken the meal was my least favorite part periodtoken my turkey sandwhich came with fresh avocade which was good but with light sourdough periodtoken what exactly is light sourdough bread it takes like white bread periodtoken the side salad was iceburg lettuce commatoken which has no nutrition but i did enjoy the dressing periodtoken last a terrible cookie that tastes as though it was made with splenda periodtoken i would probably come back here for the pastries or breakfast commatoken but not for lunch periodtoken","5694":"stopped in for a late lunch commatoken had been to the mass ave periodtoken location but had not tried this one yet periodtoken  sat at the bar commatoken bartender was eating her lunch at the bar by the cash register poor form periodtoken  started out with the onion rings commatoken which i thought would be a smaller portion commatoken but they were huge commatoken and really really good periodtoken  id go back for those alone periodtoken  i had a few commatoken boxed the rest commatoken and ordered the meatloaf sandwich from the house specialties portion of the menu periodtoken  what came out was the most confusing quasisandwich ive ever encountered periodtoken  a rather large piece of meatloaf which had been griddled and slightly burned placed on top of a one long piece of texas toast commatoken served with a side of brown gravy commatoken apple slices  and cole slaw periodtoken  one piece of bread commatoken not two commatoken clearly going for the open faced sandwich riff here commatoken and lettuce commatoken tomato and red onion were placed alongside periodtoken  i sat there for a few minutes wondering exactly what to do with this sandwich periodtoken  do i cut it in half and slap it together commatoken no way commatoken too big for that periodtoken  this confusion would have been acceptable had the sandwich tasted commatoken well commatoken like anything periodtoken  the meatloaf was devoid of any flavor commatoken and so was the brown gravy periodtoken  two key components of this sandwich commatoken completely flavorless periodtoken  the bread was ok commatoken but at that point commatoken rather insignificant periodtoken  i attempted to put the tomato and onions on top for a flavor infusion commatoken but somehow commatoken that made things taste worse periodtoken  pretty disappointing periodtoken  the apple slices served alongside were so soggy they bent when you picked them up periodtoken  the coleslaw was ok commatoken but not really my cup of tea periodtoken  i have no doubt that chatham tap has some solid food on their menu commatoken the onion rings bear that out commatoken but avoid the meatloaf sandwich periodtoken three stars for the onion rings commatoken 0 for the rest periodtoken","5706":"when we checked out perennial commatoken it was not at full functionality periodtoken they were only rolling with 3 beers commatoken some billy goat chips and cheese curds periodtoken   the beer was tasty and so were the staff periodtoken i am looking forward to returning in the future when they are running at an optimal level periodtoken very cool space periodtoken","5707":"overall this wasnt a bad experience periodtoken  we were greeted promptly and sat promptly periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhowever commatoken we were sat at a table that hardly fit our food and there was only 2 of us periodtoken  the main courses were brought out right after our appetizer more to come on that and did not leave any room on the table for all of the food periodtoken    the appetizer was highly praised by our server michael who commatoken by the way commatoken is an excellent salesman periodtoken  he claimed it was the best queso dip that hes ever had and its not runny by any means periodtoken  well commatoken it wasnt runny periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was like one greasy block of cheese all stuck together in the dish periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou pretty much had to cut it into pieces and place it on the chip or in the tortilla that they give periodtoken    the main dishes were good periodtoken  i had the chicken street tacos periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey seemed pretty authentic commatoken and there was plenty of food periodtoken  my wife had the chicken quesadilla commatoken which seemed a bit greasy but she ate most of it periodtoken    this place was nice to try commatoken but i probably wouldnt go back periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken just didnt seem like our thing periodtoken","5717":"usually pretty empty periodtoken  easy to get in and out of periodtoken  not a ton of pumps commatoken but its a small town gas station so you shouldnt be expecting a ton of them periodtoken  its a solid place to fill up periodtoken  mini mart selection is small and the people working there arent the friendliest commatoken but what can you expect","5720":"normally this is our favorite restaurant periodtoken  this time commatoken service wasnt great commatoken took way too long for our entrees periodtoken seen another table right next to us commatoken get up and leave pissed periodtoken not much to brag about this time periodtoken took forever to get a second beer periodtoken very disappointed all the way around periodtoken","5724":"we came in on raceday so im wondering if they just really werent expecting too much business periodtoken we got cuban sandwiches commatoken rice commatoken pastalitos they were out of chicken and fried plantains periodtoken the owner and staff were all really friendly and i like the location and atmosphere commatoken but stopped there periodtoken the bread was obviously stale to begin with on the sandwiches and the pastalitos were both cold periodtoken the meat wasnt warm at all periodtoken just disappointing that we spent 30 for what seemed like leftovers from the day before and im still craving cuban food","5729":"update  i am giving them a star back because it appears the owner keeps up with yelp comments and genuinely cares about reviews and customer satisfaction periodtoken this has impressed me enough to go back for another try plus a craving for truffle fries that will not go away commatoken hopefully commatoken after my next visit i will be able to bump it up another star or two periodtoken  500 commatoken i will see you soon periodtoken fellow yelpers commatoken i will keep you posted periodtoken","5732":"our recent visit to this was our second time since our first visit was uneventful and not very good periodtoken  we decided to try it again and while the service has improved dramatically commatoken i feel the menu is not very exciting periodtoken  too much like all the other mediocre restaurants periodtoken  the siena advertises a french chef and exciting food  what is exciting about prime rib  i would like to see more french versions of their food periodtoken  how about filet mignon rossini style  how about a genuine french onion soup  what about potato gratin rather than french fries what about some great french sauces  beurre blanc commatoken provencale commatoken etc periodtoken i would love to see a menu that no one else can compete with in reno periodtoken  that is not the case at da vincis periodtoken  everything was okay but the only thing that was excellent was the service periodtoken","5738":"eh  periodtoken periodtoken we came commatoken we ate commatoken we paid a lot for average fare periodtoken  exceptional was the service forgettable was the meal periodtoken obviously a popular place as it was packed  periodtoken periodtoken huge margarita selection periodtoken   it would be fair to describe forgettable with regards to the meal for example commatoken i had the mixtos tacos periodtoken i found the mixtos to be bland commatoken the cheese to be rubbery commatoken the rice and beans to be bland as well periodtoken honestly commatoken the salsa was the most flavorful part of our meal periodtoken","5739":"the breakfast burrito was tasty commatoken but not real impressed with the sticky bun they warmed in the microwave and they got hard periodtoken not impressed periodtoken  overall nah periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenglorified staryucks periodtoken","5740":"decent food for wendys periodtoken  the sweet tea was far commatoken far commatoken far too sweet even by southern standards periodtoken  i threw 80 of it away periodtoken  also commatoken the above reviewer is wrong periodtoken  there are tons of options around the area which are both tastier and healthier than wendys around the vanderbilt university medical center periodtoken  most run in the 8 to 10 range periodtoken  in the potentially tastier category  1 sam and zoes this one is a hidden gem and just across the street periodtoken  it gets amazing reviews 2 calypso cafe this one gets great reviews too and its just down the road periodtoken 3 chains like applebees and logans","5741":"i had a hankering for fried food this afternoon and lowandbehold commatoken there was chubbies drive thru beckoning to me periodtoken    ive been through a few times and it never fails to deliver large quantities of deep fried goodness periodtoken  the chicken is great periodtoken  the shrimp and fish is all you can hope for periodtoken  the fries completely suck  greasy commatoken mushy commatoken and just gross periodtoken    they had a gumbo special today commatoken which my threeyearold ordered and i ate commatoken which was really good  very smoky flavor with chicken and sausage over rice periodtoken    they tend to be slow as they make the food to order commatoken but worth the wait as theres absolutely no other option in this part of town periodtoken","5742":"bubble tea is one of my many vices periodtoken its delicious and ill never turn down the opportunity for a honeydew bubble tea with tapioca and lychee pieces periodtoken so great periodtoken anyways commatoken a friend and i came here for our bubble tea fix and it was a pretty decent experience periodtoken id come back commatoken but it wasnt anything extraordinary periodtoken   it was busy in there like every single table was full type busy periodtoken people playing games commatoken eating food commatoken drinking tea commatoken the whole thing periodtoken that being said commatoken it was also quite loud but thats what you expect when a place is this popular id like to come back and sit and enjoy myself since i only stayed in there for about 10 minutes periodtoken   i got a honeydew bubble tea and it was good i also ordered the spring rolls and they were actually really good as well periodtoken the price is decent for what you pay for and they have special deals on different days of the week commatoken so on tuesdays you get cheap green onion cakes if you buy a bubble tea commatoken on wednesdays you get cheap spring rolls commatoken etc etc periodtoken you get the idea periodtoken   the menu is huge and there are tons of options for bubble tea you can also get iced teas commatoken shaved ice commatoken hot tea periodtoken there is an endless amount of options commatoken really periodtoken i was also surprised at the amount of food they had on the menu as well also commatoken you can get a stamp card here commatoken when you buy nine bubble tea you get the tenth for free which is great for addicts like myself   lots of parking in the parking lot even though it may get quite busy commatoken depending on the time you go periodtoken there are quite a few other shops in the complex commatoken which probably contributes to the craziness periodtoken if you dont want to bother with the crazy parking lot theres an abundance of street parking close by periodtoken   the service wasnt that great when i went commatoken the girls at the till werent that friendly but i wasnt super bothered by it since they were so incredibly busy periodtoken it took a while for my spring rolls and i went up to the counter to ask for them commatoken and they were sitting behind the counter not being called out periodtoken the girl was kind of snippy about it but i didnt really care since i just wanted my food periodtoken   overall commatoken not bad periodtoken was worth the visit because the bubble tea was delicious commatoken and ill probably come back some other time commatoken maybe to enjoy a bigger dish or a game periodtoken i take experiences like this as a grain of salt hopefully i come next time and theyre friendlier periodtoken if not commatoken i know i can always leave with a delicious drink that i came for periodtoken","5746":"they really arent kidding when they tell you that their seaweed salad is different periodtoken its different commatoken and not in a positive way periodtoken it tastes as if it was soaking alongside fish periodtoken it tastes worse than seawater periodtoken it tastes like fishy water periodtoken if you like your seaweed commatoken i assure you that you wont like this version periodtoken  other than that commatoken the beef negimaki is tasty commatoken but the sushi sashimi wasnt anything to brag about periodtoken ive had better sushi elsewhere periodtoken","5752":"this is more like a 2 periodtoken5 star review periodtoken my recent experience was pretty meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i used to love this place when i lived down the street periodtoken i hadnt been in for a long time commatoken and stopped in for a quick bite and glass of wine around happy hour time periodtoken i ordered a glass of wine commatoken which was like 10 periodtoken not having a happy hour wine is really annoying commatoken although they do offer a 20 bottle periodtoken adding some glasses of wine to the happy hour menu would be cool periodtoken   i ordered the pretzel with cheese periodtoken the pretzel was hard as a rock periodtoken so hard commatoken in fact commatoken that i couldnt cut it with a steak knife periodtoken i only ate about half because i was starving it was 5pm and i hadnt eaten all day periodtoken strangely enough commatoken i feel like more than one employee saw me struggling to cut the damn pretzel commatoken and no one asked me if everything was ok periodtoken strange periodtoken i could have broken a window with that pretzel or a tooth  either way commatoken it was a disappointing visit to a place i once loved periodtoken","5754":"i had a very good breakfast here periodtoken it was the deluxe scramble which comes with your choice of ingredients periodtoken it took a while for the food to come commatoken but it was worth the wait periodtoken i am happy that they are using the building well periodtoken i will definitely be returning to try other menu items periodtoken","5758":"the kind maitre d greeted me at the door and found me a seat at one of the few tables in this small caf\u00e9 periodtoken  it was so small that he had to use my table for pitchers of water and tubs of dishes as he cleared other tables periodtoken  but he was really nice about it periodtoken  i recommend the fleurdelis omeletgreen peppers commatoken onion commatoken provolone and bits of sausage commatoken covered with a mildly spicy red sauce and crawfish periodtoken  this came with wholegrain toast and fried hash browns periodtoken  the bloody marys with baconinfused vodka and full strips of bacon swizzle sticks looked amazingit was just too early for me to indulge periodtoken","5761":"yummy food and a local spot that is centrally located with outdoor seating periodtoken folks from all over come to fradys periodtoken they have a menu that changes of hot food and will make you some fresh eggs and bacon as a morning meal if you like periodtoken   a small local shop as well that sells sodas commatoken bread commatoken and other needs commatoken not exactly a supermarket commatoken but will get you that salt or coffee you need at the last minute periodtoken   super friendly staff and an overall nice spot to know about in the area when you get tired of the other spots in the area which could happen fairly quickly if you eat at the same spots every day periodtoken","5771":"this is the closest where i live commatoken but i am not here that often periodtoken the pizza is ok commatoken not terrible but  even one of the 4 star reviews mention commatoken there are better pizza joints in philly periodtoken  so commatoken if i dont feel like getting in my car to drive there and walking over commatoken ill come over here periodtoken not to mention they are open way late commatoken so if other pizza joints are closed commatoken ill come here periodtoken   i met the owners commatoken who are nice people and i never had a bad experience with the service and sometimes there are lunch specials for 2 slices and a soda periodtoken  but the biggest  problem is there are many pizza joints in philly commatoken its a competitive market and if there are better slices out there commatoken i am going to go there periodtoken","5776":"i thought the yogurt was great with tons of toppings to choose from periodtoken  you can go healthy or go crazy with all of the choices periodtoken  seating is very limited but service was great periodtoken i will be back periodtoken","5779":"the smoothies are ok commatoken every time i get one they have some chunks of frozen fruit in it periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhich is annoying periodtoken its just an ok place commatoken nothing fantastic periodtoken","5780":"everything was good periodtoken eating on the end of the wharf is great of course commatoken staff is cool periodtoken i could give another star if the food was exceptional periodtoken the steamed mussels were really good although the broth lacked some oomph periodtoken the clam chowder was ok commatoken loaded with a lot of herbs which wasnt my style periodtoken king crab legs was probably a bad choice on my part commatoken should have ordered local catch","5781":"not bad periodtoken  first time here periodtoken  mac and cheese doesnt have much flavour periodtoken  could be an off day periodtoken  cornbread is good periodtoken  brisket a tad chewy doesnt quite have that break on bend i like periodtoken    its an ok joint","5785":"obviously its starbucks and obviously their products are the same everywhere so i wont say anything about what they have commatoken rather commatoken how they have it periodtoken  ive been here about a million times commatoken its close to school and my department frequents this location periodtoken  i give three stars because it seems that there is almost always a line periodtoken  on occasion i have waited longer than felt necessary for a drink commatoken and i have been there at least three times when they were out of vanilla syrup periodtoken  how the heck does starbucks run out of vanilla syrup  anyways commatoken  they have a great outdoor seating section commatoken one of the best in my opinion commatoken and the workers are normally very nice periodtoken","5795":"the atmosphere and the service both get 5 stars periodtoken  i have dined here twice and both times i have had young commatoken friendly commatoken efficient servers periodtoken a huge change from the toocoolforschool hipsters that the depots competition employs periodtoken  the atmosphere is also excellent with bright commatoken airy spaces that have been artfully restored to their former glory periodtoken my only complaint is that the chairs are really uncomfortable periodtoken maybe they do that so that you dont sit around and drink forever periodtoken  the music is awesome an great blend of modern and postmodern alternative periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the food is at best two stars periodtoken the menu is not to my taste periodtoken on my visits i sampled the pepper appetizer commatoken clams commatoken the sausage and pepper sandwich with house salad and burger periodtoken  everything was just average periodtoken average and pricey periodtoken  for 14 for a burger i want it to be awesome periodtoken it was bland periodtoken  anyways commatoken i want to give the depot a higher rating commatoken but i just didnt love it periodtoken","5798":"normally this is my favorite place in town for a nice dinner periodtoken they still are a great place to go for brunch commatokendrinks commatokenapps commatoken or sandwichburger periodtoken however commatoken recently they have really downgraded the quality of their steak and salmon atleast what they put on their salads and it is very disappointing periodtoken i was hoping it was just one bad batch but it has happened on more than 1 occasion recently and i have friends that have noticed the same decline in quality periodtoken dont get greedy depot everybody loves it here so just keep buying the quality ingredients you always have  ","5803":"ill echo the numerous reviews here that seem to agree that the food is pretty good if you can stomach the terrible service youre likely to get periodtoken  i think the ny style of taking a pie thats been sitting outside all day and reheating it upon order is disgusting commatoken so ill never order by the slice periodtoken however commatoken their fresh pizza is great commatoken and i love the chicken parmesan sandwich periodtoken the fries are the delicious crinklecut kind commatoken and best of all commatoken they have diet mountain dew on the fountain with flavor shots  get a cherry shot in it periodtoken  but several times weve gone there commatoken theyve been busy and depressingly understaffed periodtoken amber was our waitress two times recently commatoken and should definitely consider employment in a different industry periodtoken 5 minutes to get acknowledged at the hostess stand which employs no hostess  and servers dread going near commatoken apparently commatoken another 10 minutes once seated to get waited on periodtoken  after putting in our drink order commatoken it took commatoken no exaggeration commatoken over 10 more minutes for her to get our drinks periodtoken we fortunately put in the food order when we ordered drinks why not we had enough time to look at the entire menu commatoken and 45 minutes later when the food arrived commatoken i was told another server took my sandwich commatoken and mine would come later periodtoken my three tablemates finished their food before i got mine commatoken with no apology whatsoever periodtoken again commatoken the food was delicious commatoken but then it took another 15 minutes to get cashed out periodtoken a 75 minute experience for what amounted to be pizza and sandwiches periodtoken i wont blame the kitchen because they were busy commatoken but the service is reliably terrible periodtoken  if youve got time to spare commatoken or it doesnt look busy commatoken i do recommend precinct pizzas delicious food periodtoken but always be ready to sit there way longer than you wanted to commatoken with little to no attention paid to you by the staff periodtoken four stars for the food commatoken one star for the service commatoken but ill generously round up to 3 stars overall periodtoken","5808":"the food is not anything special periodtoken  what sets this place apart is its prime spot right there on the beach right next to the round about  the pier periodtoken  go there when its not too hot out perhaps after sunset and sit outside periodtoken  its pretty relaxing yet in the center of the action too periodtoken","5811":"everything about this was just alright periodtoken the burger was meh periodtoken not flavorful periodtoken mac and cheese was fine in a mediocre fine kinda way commatoken not a good fine kinda way periodtoken green beans were just okay periodtoken i probably wont try this again periodtoken","5813":"normally commatoken i love this store periodtoken today not so much and not for the past few months periodtoken i called to ask if they have fresh terragon bc im having a bernaise emergency and first theres no answer in any dept periodtoken then i get an answer commatoken im placed on hold commatoken then im hung up on and im sure this is intentional bc no one wants to go look periodtoken hello commatoken whole foods commatoken im giving you my business

rib mac n chez  omg delish","5827":"once again st periodtoken louis has spoiled me periodtoken the whole foods right outside of stl brentwood commatoken had got me excited about whole foods once more periodtoken first with graeters and secondly and more often once graeters appeared more places with their outstanding togo sandwiches and pastry selection periodtoken  this location commatoken however commatoken lacks an impressive or even good pastry section periodtoken their pastry case is all of two or three feet long periodtoken the one in st periodtoken louis probably four times that length periodtoken   where were the cream puffs the non mini tarts or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry where were the french inspired pastries or the vegan ones where was any of this  instead there were pudding cups i bought one  it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate commatoken but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup commatoken creme brulee commatoken two types of macaron flavors commatoken and only a few cakes albeit i am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most whole foods periodtoken there were mini tarts commatoken but all the same mixed berry flavors periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken there was no layered deserts or tiramisu periodtoken  it was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad as i had driven there hungry and wanting pastries  maybe the other location in indy will prove more fruitful or pastry case full","5828":"i am amazed that this place has as many as 4 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken  sure commatoken their food is good enough to eat commatoken but its nothing too unique periodtoken  ive never had a greek salad without olives  theirs has none commatoken but the amazing dressing is the saving grace  traditional gyro meat should be made with lamb  theirs is not commatoken but getting extra yummy tzatziki makes it delish  they can keep their farmed tilapia high in mercury and frozen french fries periodtoken  but i will scarf down a plate of zekos wings its all in the sauces with them periodtoken  overall commatoken it is a place with very friendly owners commatoken who know how to dress up their food periodtoken for this commatoken i will return  they should be aware of the badmouthing their employees do though periodtoken i dont even know them and ive heard things more than once periodtoken  p periodtokens periodtoken look at the hood this place is in commatoken and then compare that to the reviews you read ","5839":"unique flavors commatoken huge donuts commatoken cold brew on tap  hipster ambience periodtoken district reminds me a lot of los angeles so i really wanted to love it but the donut execution was poor periodtoken   like birdies in dtla commatoken the donut is a little on the dry side periodtoken i appreciate that the pumpkin cheesecake donut i ordered wasnt too sweet commatoken but everything seemed off periodtoken there was way too much dough compared to the amount of pumpkin cream cheese filling periodtoken meh periodtoken ca folks commatoken this has nothing on sidecar or blue star unfortunately periodtoken   cold brew they add chicory powder was good though","5840":"poor service is their downfall periodtoken the building is great the chicken in a biscuit is good periodtoken they charge tourism prices periodtoken great patio periodtoken","5843":"great foods everything is so spicy and delicious periodtoken i can say i love mostly everything on the menu their karaoke system is alright commatoken the rooms are too dark commatoken but overall its not bad their spicy crawfish is very good too commatoken but the bad thing about it is they put too much legs on the bottom so you dont really get much of it periodtoken overall not bad  one of my favorite restaurant in chinatown periodtoken","5848":"ive seen complaints here about the price commatoken but i felt like my steak and frites were fairly priced  15 periodtoken  for lunch periodtoken the steak was a good portion was very tasty and well cooked periodtoken  i liked the onion and butter on it too made it yummy and  special a nod by the chef that commatoken  even thought it was just steak commatoken heshe were willing to make the effort periodtoken now that i know they nailed the steak i will be back for the more adventurous items on the menu periodtoken the mussels were very fresh and tasty periodtoken  the broth was subtle and delicious periodtoken i dont like it when the broth is too garlicky or saltynot a problem periodtoken  i liked the dessert a goat cheese cheesecakesweet and fluffy periodtoken  if they didnt make it there commatoken it was close by at the hands of someone who knew what they were doing periodtoken  i hate being served a costco cheesecake that is not fresh and overly cold from recent thawing commatoken and frankly you get that a lot in tucson periodtoken  the creme brulee was very tasty too big portion with tangy blueberries and strawberries periodtoken  wait staff was very good periodtoken  smiled and were nice commatoken but not phony periodtoken  i like staff that are engaged in their work commatoken but not too earnest or chattygood job periodtoken the room was comfortable commatoken cool it was 106 outside and clean periodtoken  the table was sturdy tucson restaurants commatoken why is this such a continual issue out there and the chairs substantial and cool looking periodtoken   why i cant give maynards a 4 or 5 stars rating yet i think its cheap of them not to offer bread with the mussels i had to ask commatoken granted it was nice bread periodtoken  the bloody mary tasted bad periodtoken  it had a neato bit of asparagus commatoken but it tasted like a slim jim and was pretty weak on the liquor side of the equation periodtoken  it was bad enough to send back commatoken but i chocked it down periodtoken  i just wont put out 8 bucks for a cocktail here again periodtoken  the frites sauce is catsup not special catsup either periodtoken wineyes red wine is supposed to be room temp periodtoken but that means about 65 degrees or so periodtoken  i think it had maybe sat at the bar overnight and warmed a bit much serving zin that warm gives it a harsh edge and a stale feel periodtoken  thank god i was having a steak with it periodtoken  the choice of warm wine might be the sommeliers style periodtoken  which is fine commatoken but forget about me agreeing by buying more periodtoken  i will go back and order something more challenging food wise periodtoken  to be on the safe side commatoken i will have a simpler cocktail and enjoy a beer with my food periodtoken","5849":"the service was good periodtoken i had the lettuce wedge and not sure what size the head of lettuce was but was the smallest lettuce wedge i have every seenordered periodtoken all the other food that our family ordered was fabulous and good size portions periodtoken we also had the flights

go relatively quickly periodtoken  i had the country ham commatoken i think more than anything commatoken its just not for me periodtoken really salty commatoken but i think its supposed to be that way periodtoken my review isnt influenced by that alone periodtoken  if you want to check it out as a tourist spot commatoken by all means go periodtoken youll enjoy your pancakes commatoken but im not in a rush to wait so long for an averahe breakfast when theres so many amazing options around periodtoken","5853":"the grounds are beautiful commatoken the market is beautiful and the facilities are clean periodtoken we go once a year to do apple picking or pumpkin picking but because their goods are so pricey  we dont shop there at all periodtoken","5854":"great food but pricey and portions are too big periodtoken you order meat loaf and you get a whole meat loaf periodtoken the new 12 sandwichcup of soup special is nice but excludes the reuben option periodtoken no prices shown periodtoken everything a la carte periodtoken but the food is tasty and service is quick periodtoken expect to pay 1015 dollars for lunch though periodtoken but you wont leave hungry periodtoken baked goods very expensive too but quality is good periodtoken always ask what things cost before ordering periodtoken","5855":"greek to its core periodtoken nice atmosphere periodtoken full and bustling periodtoken service a little harried and inconsistent periodtoken  after great hummus i came to find that commatoken as i was eating my appetizers and entrees commatoken i just really dont like greek food that much periodtoken not a knock on the restaurant commatoken maybe more so my taste buds periodtoken  flat face periodtoken","5856":"this cvs is conveniently located and pretty clean

register and i have to hunt them down periodtoken prices commatoken even for a drug store commatoken are usually on the high side","5869":"went back to have lunch here the other day and was nicely surprised that we could order very tasty breakfast dishes periodtoken  the shakshuka commatoken eggs braised in tomato and pepper stew commatoken with a strong cumin flavor commatoken were certainly a good way to start our meal commatoken the softcooked peppers making a perfect accompaniment for the runny eggs periodtoken  we ordered the appetizer combination plate commatoken including wellknown meze favorites periodtoken  especially good were the crisply fried fava falafal balls commatoken other meze were quite ordinary commatoken like the lackluster tzatziki periodtoken  not at all to our liking were the mushy commatoken bland dolmades stuffed grape leaves periodtoken  the grilled pork was correctly done commatoken served with a small salad periodtoken  i was glad to see a pretty good lunch crowd commatoken the lunch prices commatoken after all commatoken are very good periodtoken  looking at the dinner menu commatoken including goat stew and rabbit commatoken i imagined the food to be more focused and also more original in the evening commatoken while the lunch choices did not surpass average commatoken including the desserts of galaktobureko with tired phyllo and a pudding with lots of rose water periodtoken  the service is knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant bright and inviting periodtoken","5870":"soda fountain square is closed as a restaurant space and is now an event space through sqwires periodtoken","5871":"the menu is great but unfortunately they are inconsistent with food prep periodtoken ive had great food commatoken then cold food commatoken then undercooked food all for the exact same dish periodtoken","5872":"we wanted to love this place commatoken it is very cool looking commatoken the food smelled great commatoken but the service really needs work periodtoken i say that the food smelled great because we actually never got ours periodtoken had to flag down a waiter just to get water commatoken then finally got our bar and food order in commatoken only to have our waiter disappear and never return periodtoken  we  sat there nearly an hour with only water commatoken and could not get anyone to help us commatoken so we decided to call it a night and head to another favorite st periodtoken charles restaurant periodtoken  to be fair commatoken the place was super busy commatoken but it wont stay that way if the service is bad periodtoken  seems like it could be a fun place periodtoken","5873":"was really disappointed when i received my tofu proven\u00e7ale this last time periodtoken  both the potatoes and tofu came out incredibly dry periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenno olive oil to be found on the plate periodtoken  their proven\u00e7ale had previously been a blend of olive oil commatoken herbs commatoken tomatoes and garlic saut\u00e9ed to perfection periodtoken  ive always asked for this dish without onions periodtoken  today the olive oil with herbs de provence commatoken garlic etc periodtoken was completely missing periodtoken  the waitress told me she had no idea why they did that periodtoken  it was just dry fried tofu with a bit of tomato and herbs periodtoken i was so disappointed that this excellent dish had been botched periodtoken  she took it back and returned with what tasted like a lesser olive oil and nearly raw garlic added to my existing plate periodtoken  i guess i wont be returning commatoken which is too bad because i adored that dish periodtoken","5894":"this place is good commatoken its not great periodtoken service is fast commatoken efficient and friendly for sure but the overall experience is lacking periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensomething but i cant place it periodtoken i ordered a cheeseburger medrare with truffle fries and a black  white milkshake periodtoken since all of these combined is pretty much my favorite thing i ever i was more than willing to hand over the 12 for the opportunity periodtoken okay commatoken now the food  1 the burger periodtoken its not like the burger isnt good commatoken because it is periodtoken its just not periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni find myself saying five guys periodtoken i admit i dont have the most refined of palettes so take that with a grain of salt periodtoken it came out more medium than medium rare and its somewhat small periodtoken i can tell that its quality meat but i like my burgers juicy and this one just isnt quite periodtoken the bun is also a huge factor for me in a burger and i just dont like this style periodtoken id dock good dog for the same reason periodtoken love the meat but the bun just doesnt cut it for me periodtoken   2 the truffle fries periodtoken omfg periodtoken the best part of the meal periodtoken the fries are amazing periodtoken id probably just pop in and buy them on their own periodtoken and at this price i dont see myself ordering truffle fries from any other establishment ever again periodtoken  3 the milkshake periodtoken boy do i love me a black  white periodtoken this one was just too chocolatey for my liking periodtoken it tasted much more like just a regular chocolate milkshake which in and of itself isnt such a bad thing except for when what you really want is the holy commatoken blended harmony of rich heavy chocolate and light as air and sweet as pie vanilla periodtoken   all in all commatoken the proximity to my workplace and the fact that it is commatoken well commatoken actually good belies that there will surely be more 500 degrees in my future periodtoken i might tweak a few things like ordering the burger rare and can you get extra cheese  i wouldnt be surprised to see this spot updated even before the next work week is out periodtoken","5897":"the sole reason this review is 3 stars instead of 2 is because of jessica periodtoken wish i could give 3 periodtoken5 periodtoken dinner on a sunday night at 420 pm took 90 minutes periodtoken we sat at the bar periodtoken ordered the vermont breakfast  american burgers periodtoken our medium  medium rare burgers were both medium well   my husband was so hungry commatoken he didnt want to send it back and wait all over again periodtoken burgers were still ok  had great flavors periodtoken we waited almost 30 minutes for milkshakes periodtoken jessica was amazing handling a busy bar counter she saw that our wait was long  went above and beyond to make our shakes herself periodtoken shakes were tasty jessica was personable  attentive to every customer at the bar as well will probably return commatoken but not anytime soon periodtoken","5903":"good farm to table option when you are trying to stay healthy periodtoken hard to do when you eat out i had their classic commatoken no bun and added a fried egg periodtoken had saut\u00e9ed spinach as my side periodtoken will be back for sure","5924":"today was my first time visiting a red robin periodtoken i had heard many good things about them from friends and family and decided to take my brother out for an early birthday lunch and a movie periodtoken the restaurant appeared very clean and service was friendly and professional with just one tiny lapse periodtoken the burgers were great and i was happy with the fact that the waitress didnt bat an eye when i ordered mine medium rare periodtoken i have had restaurants tell me they wont serve burgers below medium and that just tells me that they dont trust the quality of their meat or kitchen staff periodtoken the fries were a bit of a disappointment though periodtoken my brother had bragged about how good they were and since we were in shortly after opening at 11 am commatoken i expected them to be hot and fresh periodtoken while they werent horrible commatoken they werent very warm and several of mine were very hard commatoken like they had been left to either cook too long or sat under a heat lamp for far too long periodtoken again commatoken they werent horrible commatoken it just seemed strange for them not to be fresh so early in the day periodtoken all in all commatoken i would happily go back again periodtoken  my one issue is something that is common to a lot of restaurants periodtoken i am a big guy at 61 and around 315 lbs periodtoken many restaurants commatoken red robin included commatoken have booths with their tables firmly mounted to the floor periodtoken as a hostess commatoken if you have a larger customer coming in commatoken it might behoove you to consider seating your diner somewhere where they can be comfortable periodtoken the restaurant was sparsely populated and there were regular tables and chairs commatoken high top tables commatoken and even bar seating that would have been far more comfortable for me rather than having me try and squeeze into a booth periodtoken yes commatoken i know that the simple answer is commatoken lose weight commatoken but that doesnt change the fact that you should always try and make your customer comfortable periodtoken","5929":"i miss going to this place ever since i left missouri periodtoken the place is not very authentic but its cheap and it fills you up periodtoken the pink lemonade is off the chart and we used to hang out here with my two younger brothers periodtoken","5932":"this place seems to have worked out most of the kinks that plagued their opening commatoken such as closing in the middle of lunch prime time because they ran out of meat periodtoken  now commatoken months later commatoken i finally made another visit due to an extreme burger craving periodtoken  the burger definitely hit the spot commatoken but the experience was almost ruined by the fries periodtoken  not sure why im reading so many rave reviews for the truffle fries because mine were so greasy and salty that i needed my milkshake constantly periodtoken  i still ate the fries commatoken mind you commatoken but i feel i may regret it later periodtoken  i was trying to give them their due because of the rave about them and id never had truffle fries before commatoken but the salt and oil made it too hard to distinguish any significant difference from regular fries periodtoken  i think the shake couldve used a bit more strawberry also commatoken because it often tasted plain with just hints of strawberry commatoken although that may have been the result of the saltyass fries periodtoken  oh commatoken and 12 periodtoken50 plus tax for a cheddar cheeseburger commatoken truffle fries and a shake  i dunno periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken its really just a step above typical fast food commatoken maybe two steps actually commatoken so the price is about right for the location periodtoken   while im not an aficionado commatoken i do get the occasional craving and have had my share of good burgers periodtoken  i didnt expect it to be as pink as it was inside when i ordered medium but it was juicy and tasty periodtoken  i may go back to give them another chance to get the fries right commatoken but the burger was on point periodtoken  the portions were just right too periodtoken  just the right amount of fries commatoken over a quarter pound of meat and a good size shake maybe 16oz periodtoken  if you dont get the combo commatoken the burger alone might be a bit underwhelming at glance but i think american portions are too big anyways generally periodtoken  im 6 feet tall commatoken 190lbs and i was full after the combo commatoken without getting the itis periodtoken bottom line  a decent burger joint periodtoken","5936":"the braised pork bowl came with a pretty pitiful amount of pork but it did taste pretty good periodtoken had a taiwan beer for 3 periodtoken50 which is pretty cool periodtoken","5939":"first visit for me to the dk house and the first time in 18 years for my wife periodtoken  first impression of the grounds  they badly need landscaping upgrades and improvements periodtoken  the buildingporch roof badly needs attention periodtoken  once inside commatoken the dining areas are nicely appointed albeit needing a little tlc periodtoken  the main dining room has 78 tables and it can be very difficult to have a quiet dinner over the discussions of the other diners periodtoken  in hindsight commatoken we should have asked to be seated in the smaller dining room with the fireplace periodtoken  our appetizers were very good and fresh  shrimp cocktail for me and the shrimplobster bisque for my wife periodtoken  for dinner commatoken i had the ny strip and my wife had the filet mignon periodtoken  both of our steaks were excellent periodtoken  only complaint was from my wife as her mashed potatoes were ice cold in the middle periodtoken  dessert was apple streusel and raspberry tort commatoken both very good periodtoken  service was excellent periodtoken  it was pricey 180 including tip but wed go back periodtoken  i sincerely hope that the owners invest in the property as it is an iconic chester county location periodtoken","5943":"everyone seems to be complaining about prices but i kind of disagree periodtoken first off commatoken their triple berry cake is the best periodtoken the fruits are fresh and the cake batter is not too sweet periodtoken the small goods i must say are a little bit pricey but if you look at the details and how nice it looks you get what you pay for periodtoken the ice cream is amazing commatoken birthday cake would be my personal fave periodtoken kitchen sink is the big talk of the place but i havent come around to trying periodtoken   i come here from time to time for their breakfast if im tired of my regular pho fix periodtoken lol periodtoken my boyfriend  i came in two weeks ago and decided to sit outside under the umbrella periodtoken with new orleans bipolar weather commatoken soon enough mister sun didnt shine and the july showers came down on us periodtoken the waiter was inside and didnt come outside to assure us if we wanted to move periodtoken so we closed our own umbrella and went inside hoping we bumped into the waiter to let him know periodtoken he refilled our drink and apologized for the inconvenience periodtoken i ordered the best banker croissant and my boyfriend had the 222 periodtoken the best banker tasted better than i expected but my boyfriends 222 was small proportioned periodtoken when our food arrived my waiter again was no where to be seen when i realized we didnt have our utensils so i actually got up and got it myself periodtoken overall commatoken food was good  worth the price periodtoken better service next time please","5954":"didnt think it was worth the huge line that formed outside the place while we ate periodtoken  eggs ordinary commatoken bacon actually very dry and crispy commatoken blueberry pancakes not that extraordinary periodtoken  all in all commatoken id come back commatoken but if there was the huge line outside commatoken id recommend to find someplace else because even though the servers are prompt and efficient commatoken the whole experience was very commatoken sorry to say but in my humble opinion commatoken not memorable periodtoken","5955":"i found the food here decent commatoken but the headache of weaving through the everexpansive line stretching out the front door is not quite worth the heady taco experience periodtoken   the main issue lies within the compact entrance which leaves little to no room for people to migrate into a manageable clump periodtoken instead commatoken we piled up like herded sheep around the register commatoken then piled out the front door periodtoken luckily commatoken it was a mildly warm commatoken sunny day so most of the crowd felt rather patient periodtoken however commatoken i do not recommend coming here at peak brunch hours or evening dinner hours near weekends periodtoken my friends and i arrived at 1230pm saturday prime time lunch periodtoken we were able to sit with a lovely individual commatoken but our food took app periodtoken 45 minutes before it came out periodtoken when i asked a staff member commatoken she told me they were backed up from the whole lunch crowd periodtoken so commatoken definitely order an appetizer i recommend the queso if youre waiting periodtoken  the outdoor seating is quite sidewalkchic commatoken if you know what i mean periodtoken lots of large picnic tables and plenty of room for pets periodtoken they even provide dog bowls if fido needs a drink of water periodtoken the picnic tables commatoken i would say commatoken are also their greatest downfall periodtoken unless youre ok with sharing room family style which we were commatoken you might prefer indoor seating or taking it togo periodtoken  food was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenless stellar than expected periodtoken i had the korean bbq and brisket tacos periodtokenthe meat was quite tender for the brisket commatoken and i found the pickled red onions added just the right amount of sourness periodtoken i was disappointed by the korean bbq commatoken a decent but lackluster mixture of chopped cabbage commatoken carrots commatoken and a slightly marinated bulgogiish meat periodtoken the star of my meal was the fried green chile mac n cheese periodtoken absolute cholesterolinducing perfection periodtoken this made the meal worth the crazy line periodtoken  i would say commatoken if you havent had texmex in texas commatoken give it a shot periodtoken if you have commatoken this might not be the best wait periodtoken","5957":"i only came into this friendlys to get a friendz basically a blizzard periodtoken the restaurant was very spacious and the ice cream area was incredibly clean periodtoken i used to be an ice cream girl at friendlys when i was in high school commatoken so i know what a pain it is to keep that sticky crap from getting all over the place periodtoken  my friendz was delicious periodtoken  ill be back","5965":"food is ok for a hospital periodtoken some of the staff are nice commatoken others are rude periodtoken overpriced but have a  captive audience  meaning patient families periodtoken plus hardly any place nearby to eat periodtoken","5966":"great place to grab a sandwich with no waiting periodtoken  pretty generous portion for turkey with cheese or roast beef periodtoken  nice touches include starting with a fresh commatoken delicious roll commatoken roasted red peppers commatoken razor thin sliced onions commatoken and wellpaired cheese periodtoken  for 5 periodtoken99 and ready made commatoken you cant go wrong for the neighborhood periodtoken  overall commatoken the store is nice commatoken with a lot of items commatoken if you look hard enough periodtoken  they also tend to have some really good sales esp periodtoken meats so commatoken have a look periodtoken  fresh and reasonable produce and friendly staff commatoken too periodtoken","5969":"great cappuccino periodtoken although my wet cappuccino and my husbands dry cappuccino came out exactly the same periodtoken  the coffee itself had good flavor periodtoken cute midtown location periodtoken  it would be nice if there were better menu signs periodtoken   but overall a nice cup of coffee periodtoken","5970":"setting aside my expectations of a barista greeting me  being able to take my order pretty quickly commatoken im hopefully optimistic periodtoken  so commatoken the shift manager was on the phone when i walked in  didnt acknowledge me periodtoken one other barista is working drive thru  not tons of cars in line 1or2 commatoken but engaged periodtoken looks like another barista may be coming on periodtoken  okay commatoken so ill just order on the app  see what happens  two other customers came in  ordered after me periodtoken manager finished the call  took an order  boom delivered periodtoken next order delivered periodtoken  dont see my order at pick up commatoken guess ill get off here and go check in periodtoken not the best sbucks in town periodtoken oh wait commatoken my name was just called  received my drink commatoken but im thinking i may have to ask for my bakery item commatoken hmm commatoken yeah the barista is helping a new customer now periodtoken  the kid that just came on and is taking over the dthru seems pretty sharp periodtoken shift manager is tagteaming the order for the new customer commatoken i think another customer has come in  maybe four min ago  not acknowledged until the barista was ready to take the order periodtoken  man commatoken i want my bakery item  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken lots of gnats where im standing btw periodtoken latest customer a new one doesnt look to pleased  oh commatoken just got asked if i was waiting on another mobile order  gonna get my bakery item commatoken yes  got it commatoken oh  the barista apologized for the wait thats what im taking about commatoken a little acknowledgment goes a long way periodtoken ah commatoken just realize the shift manager was making a big ole fancy drink just before announcing see you after my 10 min break periodtoken  ill give another star  i dont like complaining periodtoken just wish i could have been greeted with a hi or hello or good afternoon maybe a well be right with you periodtoken just a side note  no napkins commatoken tables are dirty periodtoken im thinking this could be a fantastic sbucks wa little better management  a lot of hard work periodtoken realize this is more a play by playcommentary commatoken not done many reviews periodtoken thanks for letting me vent periodtoken ill be back periodtoken im a sucker periodtoken plus commatoken maybe i could be an encouragement commatoken maybe help somehow  right","5973":"tastey pastry periodtoken  similar to a funnel cake periodtoken the only difference is the dough folded instead of spread out periodtoken only eat when freshly made periodtoken and do not worry about the powdered sugar periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it will end up everywhere","5977":"probably a great stop for breakfast commatoken but i came for a late lunch periodtoken food was good commatoken i didnt know all the variations they offer commatoken the nutella stuff looked delicious good music playing commatoken staff did a fair job commatoken but the facility wasnt very clean periodtoken looked as if it had not been cleaned since the breakfast shift commatoken floors commatoken tables etc periodtoken   ill be back most likely commatoken for breakfast next time periodtoken","5980":"quality delivered with disdain periodtoken  the sushi is good and the saki selection is great but its brought to you commatoken eventually commatoken  by people that clearly have better things to do periodtoken the lunch buffet is great and it minimizes your reliance on the wait staff periodtoken   the atmosphere is nothing to write home about but the music periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the music is bumpin banal blather that limits your ability to hold a conversation without it devolving into a combination of shouting a charades periodtoken that said lunch is better but once the sun sets the boombastic buffoonery begins periodtoken","5992":"outliers gets a generous 3 star rating from me commatoken but is a place i will continue to go back to when it is convenient to get a few beers periodtoken i have to judge them up against the ever growing list of breweries in indy commatoken and it just seems that they fall towards the back of the pack in most categories periodtoken    lets start with the beer periodtoken they almost always have their 4 house beers on tap periodtoken these include a brown commatoken an ipa commatoken a rye commatoken and a pilsner periodtoken all of them are decent beers and worth getting commatoken but none of them are head over heels better than what you can get at most places periodtoken along with those 4 are usually a few taps of either a seasonal or some brugge stuff periodtoken i have had some good sourfruit beers from here commatoken and i know they do some different barrel aging as well commatoken so there are some interesting options every once in a while periodtoken the issue is that these extra beers commatoken when they have them commatoken are really slow to change and they havent expanded their standard lineup in the year and a half they have been brewing periodtoken it seems in my experience that it is not uncommon to see the same tap offerings for well over a month commatoken which leads to me not stopping in here as much as i would otherwise periodtoken they just dont hold a flame to the variety of styles and beers that the other breweries in indy have commatoken and their lineup gets boring quickly because of it periodtoken  the space is not much to get excited about either periodtoken its an old warehouse with some picnic tables to sit at and some plastic tables in front of a tap trailer where you order your beer commatoken but they have gone out of their way to keep the brewing and drinking areas separate commatoken which is very disappointing periodtoken i love visiting breweries that have their brewery area prominently featured in their location commatoken but you cant see much of any of their operation from the tables commatoken which makes sitting in the old space even less justifiable when there are lots and lots of breweries in indy that have a nicer setup and their whole operation is in view of the customers periodtoken they pretty much just have about the bareminimum setup for people to stop in a try some beers commatoken but it looks like more of an afterthought to me and isnt a place i would choose to go sit at for an afternoon periodtoken  the hours here recently got extended to be a little better than they were commatoken so now you can drink here friday from 48 commatoken saturday from 25 commatoken or sunday from 124 periodtoken these hours make it obvious that they have a brewery that thrives on sales to restaurants much more than sales from their location periodtoken service hasnt always been the best commatoken and often it seems like the people working here are more what you would find at a brew fest where they are just volunteers helping the company out by pouring some beers periodtoken they are usually a little slow commatoken dont know much about the beer commatoken and i have on numerous occasions gotten served short pours because there is so much foam in my beer that they dont dump out or let settle periodtoken they are always nice though commatoken and i assume it is hard to find someone who is a great customer service person who wants to work only a few hours on a saturday afternoon or friday evening periodtoken  i like that they are another local breweries that makes some good stuff commatoken and their location close to my place is a big draw for me periodtoken it will continue to be a brewery that i stop at to get some decent beers at good prices commatoken and maybe to try the occasional new offering commatoken but it seems like they have been at a standstill for a while as far as what they have to offer so my visits keep getting more and more spread out periodtoken hopefully things are working out for them though commatoken and i will continue to keep an eye on their social media to seek out their new stuff when they have it periodtoken","5993":"got the soy black milk tea with pearls commatoken 5 periodtoken13 periodtoken its similar to thai milk tea commatoken which was why i purchased this commatoken however commatoken when i asked the girl at the counter if it was like a thai milk tea she said it was powder periodtoken not really descriptive but tried it anyway periodtoken the taste was fine commatoken but 5 periodtoken13 is a little steep for me periodtoken","5996":"for the area acceptable periodtoken  its the only game in town commatoken  so special treatment isnt common periodtoken  dealers by the majority are not friendly commatoken  it strikes you as a 20 of the dealers make 80 of the tips scenerio periodtoken i dont need a fan club commatoken  but at least pretend you dont hate your job periodtoken  weve dined at every restaurant and cant say weve ever had a bad meal periodtoken","6004":"heart food commatoken but poor service periodtoken try not to go in the afternoon during shift change periodtoken one server commatoken one bartender commatoken and night bartender and barback leaned against the counter and talked instead of helping the slammed am staff periodtoken you would think they would help to push the process of clearing out so that they can make money periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken ","6008":"i used to love coming to baileys range when they first opened periodtoken  their burgers were generous commatoken never dry and good quality periodtoken  however commatoken last time we went commatoken they size of the burger drastically decreased and even though we ordered our burgers medium commatoken they were very dry periodtoken  i also recall getting more of their homemade sauce commatoken but think they may give you less now periodtoken  the ice cream is still as good as i remember it commatoken but i dont think we will be going back any time soon periodtoken  too many other burger joints that arent nearly as expensive for what you get periodtoken","6018":"i got a sticky bun periodtoken it was very stale periodtoken not good periodtoken i expected good things since it was a city bakery periodtoken very disappointed periodtoken  edit after my one star commatoken swiss haus reached out to me and offered me to come in and choose something on the house periodtoken i appreciate that they care enough to do that periodtoken though i wont be taking them up on the offer commatoken kudos to them periodtoken two more stars","6019":"we tried pizza mizza because my hubby saw that they offer glutenfree crust in an ad somewhere periodtoken the 3 stars is for said glutenfree crust  the best ive had anywhere periodtoken they lose the other 2 stars for 1 the glutenfree crust is not on their menu commatoken so you have to know to ask for it periodtoken  2 the staff was pretty lukewarm commatoken didnt seem to want to be there periodtoken 3 we werent told upon ordering that they charge an extra 2 for glutenfree periodtoken the bill for 2 personal size pies and 2 drinks was a whopping 29 periodtoken very overpriced commatoken imo commatoken but i would definitely recommend them for those who want a good pizza and dont mind the price periodtoken","6023":"my first time here and i honestly think this was the worst experience ive had at a restaurant periodtoken i was really disappointed with the food periodtoken i was hoping itll taste authentic commatoken but i guess they made it more americanized which is kind of understanding periodtoken i ordered the papaya salad thum ma hoong for appetizer commatoken it tasted okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken down side was that it was too plain for me commatoken didnt really taste like the flavor i was hoping for periodtoken  the pad see ew was also so flavorless commatoken i wanted to get a taste of toastyness from the noodles periodtoken lastly commatoken the desert periodtoken i ordered the sweet mango sticky rice which is my favorite thai desert ever and i was really upset with this one periodtoken the sticky rice was more on the soggy side than sticky side periodtoken the coconut cream was just slapped on top of the sticky rice which i dont know why because its suppose to be mixed together with the sticky rice periodtoken also the mango wasnt ripe commatoken it was hard  not as sweet as it should be periodtoken the only thing that pleased me was the beef jerky seen hang commatoken it was really chewy  flavorful with seasoning  a side of a sweet spicy tangy sauce which made it taste 10x better periodtoken although commatoken the food wasnt to my likings commatoken the service  the environment was great  soothing periodtoken which was the reason for the 3 stars periodtoken friendly staff commatoken but horrible food periodtoken","6025":"food 2  5 stars  the breakfast poutine 4  5 stars the real highlight of todays brunch was my friends breakfast poutine  i stole a few bites periodtoken the poutine had a rich flavor and was very satisfying periodtoken   the duck confit   5 stars did not try but was told that the dish tasted great periodtoken   smoked salmon beni 0  5 stars although i was looking forward to my dish commatoken the smoked salmon beni was a huge disappointment periodtoken not only was the salmon in small supply commatoken it tasted like overcooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised definitely not a deal with the 12 periodtoken00 price tag that comes along with it periodtoken even though the eggs commatoken potatoes commatoken and other fixings of the dish tasted great commatoken the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking  especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant periodtoken i was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish periodtoken     location not a factor in the rating  prep  pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant periodtoken there are a lot of places to park even if the lot is full and we only waited about 30 min on a holiday sunday at noon periodtoken     service 5  5 stars  the servers were very nice and accommodating at the restaurant periodtoken additionally commatoken they were thorough on ensuring that the kitchen staff was notified of my allergy to nuts periodtoken     overall 3 periodtoken5  5 stars   overall commatoken i enjoyed my experience at prep  pastry and will most likely return to try some of their other food offerings however commatoken i will be avoiding their smoked salmon beni periodtoken","6026":"im sad to report that it seems the quality here is slipping periodtoken at first commatoken i thought it was a fluke commatoken but ive been here several times now and its definitely on the decline periodtoken the flavors arent as tasty as they used to be commatoken and the texture isnt as consistent almost all have runny spots and many sputter when coming out periodtoken ive tasted a few that would even be described as questionably fresh commatoken and one that was definitely bad they replaced it immediately after i brought it to their attention commatoken but still periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken in addition commatoken their toppings have gone down in quality  taste too commatoken namely the mochi commatoken the cookie dough commatoken and the brownies periodtoken not sure if this was their choice or their suppliers commatoken but its not good periodtoken the paninis they promised early in the season apparently didnt pan out periodtoken plus commatoken the spoons they use are not great for froyo commatoken and are even a little sharp and too deep commatoken and not ecofriendly many better ones exist periodtoken its still clean commatoken but not the sparkling clean it used to be periodtoken the girls who work there are personable commatoken but the really sweet manager commatoken allison commatoken who made customers feel really welcomed commatoken is no longer there periodtoken  they bring in a lot of different machinedispensed frozen treats commatoken in addition to the froyo periodtoken they started with old school frozen custard commatoken and added gelato and lower fatglycemic varieties commatoken and now even have italian ice periodtoken the ratio of frozen yogurt to these other items seems to be getting smaller periodtoken thats not necessarily bad commatoken just a heads up periodtoken i actually think this is kinda cool commatoken and if they were to expand on it a bit and offer really unique highquality options commatoken like soyvegan froyo or unusual flavors maybe something spicy instead of 3 different meh vanillas and 3 different meh chocolates commatoken theyd have something really cool  worth driving farther for periodtoken in fairness commatoken they do usually have a sea salt somethingorother commatoken kahlua chocolates commatoken and a bananaycaramely option commatoken but even those are pretty typical froyo finds periodtoken  also commatoken they possibly used to have a sugarfree option i only suppose this because the last time i was in there commatoken several different customers asked about it commatoken but the response was that they dont have a sugarfree flavor commatoken just the lower glycemic flavors and a sugarfree chocolate sauce periodtoken most customers who asked commatoken just walked out disappointed periodtoken another headsup commatoken if youre in search of that periodtoken  these changes arent enough to prevent me from going there at all froyos yummy commatoken but they certainly have made me less excited about it and more inclined to look for other options periodtoken unfortunately commatoken there really arent many in the area periodtoken i know im not the only person whos less happy with berry creamy than i used to be periodtoken i hope they heed constructive feedback from loyal customers and keep a check on their quality periodtoken it was one of the things that made this place so much better than the others id been to periodtoken berry creamy is still highish on my list commatoken but im worried about their position in the future periodtoken","6034":"the blu fig is home to some great mediterranean grub but has an odd set up periodtoken   pro blu fig is home to probably the friendliest staff of any mediterranean restaurant ive been to periodtoken   pro a couple of vegetarian options available commatoken including homemade falafel periodtoken   pro they have fruit tea one of my favorite things about nashville periodtoken   con the overall set up and flow of the place was weird periodtoken we were halfway waited on and halfway on our own periodtoken you place your order at the register but then dont pay until youre done dinning periodtoken   con there isnt much sitting room inside will probably be difficult during the winter months to find a spot to sit periodtoken   overall though commatoken it was good enough that i would go back periodtoken the falafel alone was worth the trip there periodtoken obed commatoken the manager there commatoken was extremely talkative and eager to share with you how the blu fig is different than other mediterranean restaurants periodtoken","6038":"cupcakes looked very yummy but were just average cupcakes periodtoken i was hoping they would be something more than that periodtoken i could have gone to the store and bought the same quality cupcakes periodtoken","6046":"most awkward drive through ever to enter and exit periodtoken   no playspace for kids periodtoken  efficient if you can manage to get in and out during busy traffic times periodtoken  nough said periodtoken","6047":"the sushi is decent commatoken pretty basic commatoken nothing fancy periodtoken the pick 2 is a great deal periodtoken if you order take out commatoken add about 20 to 30 minutes to the estimated time its done because without fail its never ready when we show up to pick it up periodtoken","6056":"i was really hesitant to try this place because of the poor reviews periodtoken it isnt oh my gosh amazing commatoken but it was good enough periodtoken i would definitely go back if i was in need of a pho fix periodtoken noodle city is much closer to me commatoken but they fail to cater to a vegetarian audience commatoken so i never go there periodtoken   i ordered the vegetable noodle soup with tofu and it was good periodtoken there were tons of noodles and vegetables periodtoken so much so that i ate some at the tables outside of pho bistro and the rest at home and promptly passed out afterwards periodtoken im not sure if that is a good or bad sign periodtoken i also had a taro milkshake commatoken and i cant complain periodtoken it was tasty periodtoken if i was craving pho in iv commatoken i wouldnt hesitate to come here periodtoken the service was good as well periodtoken","6057":"food always good some of their waiters are poor periodtoken  i hate it when a waiter fails to keep your water and ice tea glasses with something in them periodtoken  i also hate that they clear your dishes while your still eating periodtoken  leave me alone and let me eat periodtoken","6060":"the park has a lot of holes and cracks in the floor commatoken and a lot of the ramps need repair periodtoken some ramps have water damage periodtoken the staff are friendly commatoken though","6069":"the ice cream itself is very tasty but the service lacked something to be desired periodtoken for example there were 3 teenagers standing behind the counter that were less than attentive because they were to busy talking to each other periodtoken also commatoken the main reason i visited was to get the waffle cone which was very good last time commatoken and they didnt even have them available periodtoken","6071":"this place serves american style breakfast periodtoken do not expect patisserie here periodtoken their cinnamon roles are very large and covered in icing periodtoken its a sugar coma waiting to happen periodtoken the cheesecherry danish was quite good periodtoken the coffee was mediocre and took a while to prepare periodtoken avoid during rush breakfast hours on the weekend periodtoken","6076":"flies commatoken flies commatoken and more flies  it would be 5 star for take out because you wouldnt have to deal with flies periodtoken  but since its a food truck commatoken its all outdoors and the flies are annoying periodtoken","6077":"while i did not eat here i am extremely disappointed with katies pizza periodtoken this past friday night commatoken i went to katies for girls night periodtoken while the pizza and pasta they ordered they had enjoyed periodtoken i had two glasses of their house wine 9 each glass periodtoken i had asked for the check and when i received it i saw it was 19 periodtoken55 periodtoken i gave the waiter who had asked us 5 times if we were still okay commatoken clearly ready for us to leave 15 cash commatoken told him to take 5 for a tip and said put the rest on my card periodtoken i got the bill back commatoken i signed without really paying attention which is my fault periodtoken i looked at the receipt when i got home and saw that he had charged my card 15 and kept the rest of my cash for himself i was extremely upset commatoken but there was nothing i could do at that point periodtoken so my advice to you if you decide to go to katies pizza is to really look at the bill and make sure that they are charging your card correctly this is not a place i would expect waiters to do this but unfortunately it is periodtoken","6084":"i just had brunch with my wife at maynards kitchen commatoken for valentines day periodtoken we had eggs benedict and beignets for our meal commatoken and mimosas and a bellini for our beverages periodtoken i also had a cup of espresso periodtoken  my wifes eggs benedict were better than mine commatoken as she had bacon while i had crabcakes periodtoken although they were better commatoken the bacon was a little dry and chewy periodtoken my crabcakes were okay commatoken not great commatoken but the english muffin was a little charred commatoken and left a burnt taste with every bite periodtoken both eggs benedict were skimpy on hollandaise sauce periodtoken  i had thought about having the omelet with lump crab meat commatoken but i asked in what form the restaurant receives its crab meat periodtoken the waitress checked with the kitchen and then informed us the crab meat comes in a can periodtoken as i wanted crab commatoken i thought the crabcakes commatoken which she said were made in the kitchen commatoken were the better way to go periodtoken  our waitress was friendly commatoken but not well trained periodtoken she didnt know the difference between a mimosa and a bellini commatoken she didnt bring us any silverware with our beignets we were sharing an order for dessert commatoken she referred to the creme fraiche as whipped cream commatoken and when i asked for a double espresso commatoken she brought me a single espresso periodtoken  for a restaurant that tries to market itself as a highend dining establishment commatoken the performance was poor to average commatoken certainly not highend periodtoken  five months ago commatoken we visited with our daughter and our dog commatoken sat outside commatoken and had a wonderful brunch periodtoken i would have given five stars for that visit commatoken but today commatoken i think three stars is a fair rating periodtoken","6087":"glad to see a place like this open up in voorhees commatoken but beer tastes just okay and no hard cider options apps are good overall periodtoken lots of seating in the bar area","6098":"it was so busy that it was hard to have a good time periodtoken our food took over 45 minutes to come out and the waiter was often hard to find periodtoken however commatoken the ice cream martinis kept us occupied during the long wait","6100":"3 periodtoken5  we came in on a midweek night periodtoken  it was a little strange that the number of diners in the restaurant four were far outnumbered by the number of staff who seemed to just stand around listlessly periodtoken  it felt a bit awkward and made the ambiance commatoken im sorry to say commatoken a bit grim periodtoken    i ordered a combination platter of souvlaki and gyros which was pretty good for 12 periodtoken50 periodtoken  we also ordered a hummus plate as a starter and it was also tasty periodtoken  service was good commatoken if not muted periodtoken   ive been to a lot of greek restaurants and they are usually festive and happy places with a lot of laughter and a vibrant air periodtoken  this was not one of them periodtoken  on the plus side commatoken conversations could be easily heard between diners commatoken so no need to shout to each other in order to have a conversation periodtoken","6107":"sadikis is now relish commatoken nothing lasts over there for more than a couple months periodtoken periodtoken went on mothers day periodtoken food was ok side note the seafood mac n cheese was bangin periodtoken nice atmosphere but way to expensive

periodtoken","6108":"meh periodtoken everything is pretty average periodtoken nothing has very much flavor periodtoken below average service periodtoken not someplace i intend to return to periodtoken","6113":"had the buckaroo burger periodtoken too expensive for what you get periodtoken if the meat is high quality why feel the need to cover it up with so many other ingredients and condiments  granted im not a huge burger fan to begin with but the quality did not warrant the price periodtoken","6121":"i come here every time when i am in university city periodtoken food is good

commatoken ingredients inside the sandwich were fresh and good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut  the bread was standard softy hoagie roll stuff commatoken not the crusty commatoken light baguette that makes good banh mi so delicious periodtoken  typical banh mi are not the overstuffed meat overload sandwiches of philly  so the doughy hoagie roll overshadows the rest of the ingredients here periodtoken","6128":"just overpowering periodtoken  sushi is all about the fish commatoken and everything here was about everything except the fish periodtoken  all the flavors were just so overpowering here commatoken and when you tried to isolate the fish commatoken it just wasnt the quality that i expect for sushi in comparison to some of the other local options periodtoken    i do think if youre someone who is all into strong flavors and the texture of the fish itself is less important commatoken youll like this place commatoken and i can see this being some peoples favorite sushi restaurant based on how strong the sauces are commatoken but for me commatoken its just too much sauce periodtoken  if youre about the sauce and smells and you dont really like sushi commatoken this might be a good place to try to be introduced to sushi commatoken but if you like subtle flavors and really care about the mouthfeel and flavor of the fish commatoken id give this place a pass periodtoken","6131":"the food is good commatoken but they forgot my sandwich order and i had to go up and ask in order to get it made periodtoken","6133":"ill start by saying that this place did not get a better rating because its lack of staff periodtoken hopewell valley vineyard is beautiful periodtoken they had two events on what turned out to be a gorgeous saturday afternoon periodtoken they only had one person cooking commatoken three people behind the bar periodtoken clearly thats not enough periodtoken we werent able to do the wine tasting because it would

working at the front was extremely accommodating and on top of taking care of my little group periodtoken the chef put extra whipped cream on the girls shakes  they loved them 55  the place itself is adorable and welllit commatoken and fun periodtoken the art is local and the quirky personalization are special enjoyable periodtoken 55 periodtoken   unfortunately the reason for 35 is the food commatoken which is ultimately an important part of going out to lunch periodtoken the coffee was sadly lukewarm and would have tasted wonderful with a simple fix periodtoken i ordered a small kale salad and the vegetarian soup of the day commatoken i found the soup rather oddtasting and didnt end up finishing it due to strange texture and tastecombinations periodtoken the kale salad was okay but nothing you couldnt get at bread co periodtoken my sister ordered a ham  cheese panini and really liked it and the shakes were enjoyed by all despite the other frustrating dishes periodtoken definitely consider what you order if coming here and keep with classics commatoken the more creative options may leave you conflicted periodtoken   like i said commatoken hate to give a 3star review commatoken the atmosphere and staff were definitely on point periodtoken","6161":"this is not your los angeles donuts commatoken but this place is unique periodtoken their donuts are different than

commatoken i guess periodtoken","6181":"good food decent price some suggestions when going thru drive thru wish they would give you everything at once they always give you your ice cream like 4 min before your food ok during winter but in the summer it melts as you have window down waiting for food which also sucks if your taking it home to eat but its melted by the time you get there periodtoken also one time i went in with my family it smelt of dirty diapers we complained they just laughed periodtoken it may have been bad bleach for mopping or a customer put a diaper in trash but it stunk so bad that we left as it made us sick why smell dirty diapers when your eating fast food","6184":"let me start by saying that i love in n out and i would give in n out 5 stars hands down for

site to see periodtoken  we ordered our food and it took like 15 minutes to get it and it wasnt even that crowded which is rare periodtoken  in n out usually pumps out your food asap but tonight they lagged big time periodtoken  the last straw was that we got our food and our burgers still had a tad of pink in them periodtoken  this is the second time commatoken both times here at this in n out i have ever had that happen to me periodtoken  both times resulting in some stomach problems if you know what i mean periodtoken  the fries tasted a tad funky too like they were sitting out for awhile

been to periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken5 stars periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthis one in goleta periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenonly 3 periodtoken","6189":"decent schnucks location commatoken my biggest gripe is the parking lot seems sort of small periodtoken if you are in this area far prefer dierbergs or trader joes periodtoken","6190":"i cant go more than 3 stars since its local commatoken organic and gluten free sections arent as large as say trader joes or whole foods type stores periodtoken   but they are the cheapest supermarket in delco and better than all of the other big brand name markets periodtoken acne  commatoken super fresh  commatoken etc periodtoken   plus they have their can can sales periodtoken and even if their organic section is small compared to trader kids and whole foods its bigger than other brand name markets except maybe for the giant on oak ave periodtoken   cashiers are quick and lines move fast that is plus periodtoken for most consumers it get 4 stars but our house is organic so its get deducted a star periodtoken","6191":"burger up was more like burger ok

chalkboard talking about what farms they source for food periodtoken  very cool in my book periodtoken  the service was great periodtoken  the hostess was awesome with her greeting and our server leah was pretty nice periodtoken  now the food could use a little improvement periodtoken  i got the black bean and quinoa burger with the sweet potato fries periodtoken  the fries were soggy and at a lukewarm temperature periodtoken  my friends truffle fries were of the same quality as far as temperature and texture go periodtoken  the burger was also a little on the lukewarm side too commatoken not hot at all periodtoken  my friends did not oh and awe over their burgers either periodtoken    i might be back for lunch at the least commatoken but as for now commatoken not my top choice periodtoken","6192":"note the location of this food truck is next to the thorntons gas station parking lot periodtoken just drive up along armenia and you should see the red truck tucked behind a small make shift white fence periodtoken i ordered the 4 tacos for 8 special commatoken all dressed with raw onions and cilantro periodtoken the tacos were al pastor commatoken steak commatoken chorizo and fish periodtoken they were all tasty and freshly made the fish tasted especially fresh it didnt have the typical bland commatoken watery taste of defrosted frozen fish periodtoken my wife commatoken though commatoken said all the tacos were too salty commatoken except for the al pastor commatoken which is normally sweeter than most fillings due to the pineapple periodtoken our table mates commatoken who were mexican commatoken said the red ceviche was most delicious periodtoken the lemonade was not freshly madesqueezed as the sign suggested periodtoken all in all commatoken a solid place to try periodtoken the service was quick and friendly periodtoken","6193":"we made the biggest valentines faux pas which is commatoken deciding last minute to go out for valentines day periodtoken luckily thanks to the open table app commatoken we were able to secure a reservation saturday night for a peak hour seating periodtoken the restaurant doesnt look like much from the outside as it is housed in a large commatoken commercial style building commatoken but the inside is fresh commatoken brightly lit and minimally decorated periodtoken  i award three stars for the experience commatoken as service was friendly commatoken accommodating commatoken timely and food was executed to the best of their ability periodtoken where i found it lacking commatoken was taste and temperature commatoken general atmosphere periodtoken too picky we ordered the blue crab dip with parmesan cream for our first course commatoken second the cream of mushroom soup and complimentary salad for the special entree commatoken and entrees were eggplant vincent and the fish of the day commatoken redfish commatoken served whole with potatoes and vegetable of the day periodtoken  the soup was served first commatoken and was under seasoned and not very hot periodtoken crab dip came next and though gooey commatoken bubbly and tasty commatoken was slightly overshadowed by the pools of oil on top periodtoken  the entrees were also good commatoken my boyfriend loved the simplicity of his fish and it was cooked correctly periodtoken my eggplant vincent was  a cup of eggplant breaded and fried and stuffed with crab and shrimp commatoken served over a butter cream sauce and angel hair periodtoken again commatoken slightly under seasoned commatoken but over all a good commatoken tasty dish periodtoken overall commatoken not my pick for a romantic evening or food to write home about commatoken but suitable for an affordable commatoken seafood orientated craving periodtoken","6194":"after hearing a lot of hype over baileys range from my friends commatoken i decided to check it out for dinner one weekend with my girlfriend and her friends periodtoken i went in with high expectations commatoken but was left just feeling meh at the end of the meal periodtoken  i ordered one of the burgers they were featuring for the week as a part of their burger battles a turkey burger with a korean twist periodtoken right off the bat commatoken i was disappointed that fries did not come with the burger and cost extra periodtoken fine commatoken whatever commatoken i ordered some periodtoken when my meal came commatoken it was a let down by all accounts periodtoken both the bread and the burger were charred which gave every bite a bitter charcoal taste periodtoken the fries were limp and soggy commatoken as if they were neglected at the pass periodtoken  the only upside was the desserts periodtoken we shared a strawberry sorbet and a pistachio  cookies  cream in a waffle bowl periodtoken both were amazing periodtoken the sorbet was tangy and tasted of real fruit periodtoken the ice cream was creamy and rich on top of a freshly made waffle bowl still warm periodtoken  i will definitely come back in the future for their desserts commatoken but their burgers leave much to be desired periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6200":"this was one of the last stops we made on our way to black rock city commatoken nv periodtoken we ran inside to grab some postcards to send to ourselves at burning man commatoken but only found a card aisle instead periodtoken we ended up buying several birthday cards and tearing off the backs to make them into a onepage postcard periodtoken we stood in a slow line and paid for the cards and stamps commatoken but were then told they have no outgoing mail or nearby po boxes periodtoken they also wouldnt let us leave the cards and put them in their own outgoing mail periodtoken we luckily found a fitness equipment supply store nearby that was happy to mail our cards for us periodtoken service was friendly but it would have been nice to have a place to mail out the cards that they sell here periodtoken","6201":"first off commatoken the name reminds me of a swim school not a restaurant and the decor is lacking and should be redone periodtoken with that said the food was ok  my steakhouse salmon was pretty tasty and my husbands guinness fish and chips were also good periodtoken my son also had fish and chips and he liked it periodtoken there was nothing outstanding though and it was pretty overpriced periodtoken not sure if i will be back but it was a pleasant enough dining experience and the service was good commatoken","6205":"i had the chicken noodle soup and it was incredibly salty and the chicken was chewy periodtoken portions were small periodtoken extra star for the friendlyness of the staff and beautiful decor periodtoken","6210":"we read about this place in the st

originality and separates itself from the taco buses of the area periodtoken   positives recommended food choice commatoken chorizo periodtoken good corn tortillas periodtoken in my opinion commatoken better than the taco bus periodtoken not as starchy periodtoken  negatives carne asada tacos could have been marinated longer periodtoken i expected more flavor periodtoken abrasive staff commatoken could be friendlier periodtoken you are made to feel rushed to order at the counter periodtoken parking limited and seating limited periodtoken be prepared periodtoken  overall commatoken not blown away periodtoken i have had better periodtoken bottom line is i expected more flavor periodtoken","6212":"i came here hungry commatoken left disappointed periodtoken the food tasted good commatoken but the price and the quantity left my stomach feeling empty periodtoken better off going to a tapas place  more variety for the money periodtoken the donuts were good  commatoken nothing out of this

place periodtoken","6224":"stopped in for lunch periodtoken waiter had no personality periodtoken  none of the wait staff were really friendly commatoken very somber atmosphere periodtoken a cook pointed out to our waiter that a table needed his attention periodtoken had a poor boy shrimp sandwich periodtoken i think these sandwiches are special because of the roll periodtoken hard to say but

werent seasoned enough with lime and salt periodtoken    overall commatoken it was a mediocre experience periodtoken  id still pick chipotle over their q competitors anyday periodtoken  3 stars periodtoken","6227":"we usually dine here at least twice a month periodtoken part of a great dining experience is the staff and how they interact with the customers periodtoken the interaction and courtesy is now missing from this venue periodtoken there is no longer a welcoming atmosphere here or any concern as to the dining experience of the customers periodtoken this is unfortunate as it detracts from the overall dining experience periodtoken our order was not completed as asked  we were presented with a dirty wine glass to use periodtoken it was wiped with a napkin but was still dirty when given to us periodtoken food still good but the place is in decline periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6229":"i guess you could call this slot machine heaven commatoken smoker central

on our usual thursday date night periodtoken we got a flight of all of their ciders only 4 and decided there was only one of those we half liked and the rest we did not like at all and had to force down periodtoken i think we like dry ciders commatoken not a lot of hops commatoken with a hint of sweetness commatoken but the ciders here were all too sweet commatoken too hoppy commatoken or just plain gross periodtoken recommend going to cinder if you want to try a bunch of ciders though not all of theirs are locally brewed obviously since its a ciderpizza bar commatoken not a cidery periodtoken","6236":"to be honest i really struggle with this brewery periodtoken i love multiple levels of their establishment commatoken but the beer is not one of them periodtoken and lets face it commatoken its a brewery periodtoken isnt that kind of important   lets start with the heart eyes emoji provoking assets periodtoken their food is great periodtoken their fried chicken sandwich melts in your mouth i didnt order this but i always get a taste of my buddies palate  periodtoken their bao buns were not the best ive ever had commatoken but still tasty periodtoken i actually prefer mine more on the airy commatoken fluffy side commatoken but they choose to sear theirs so its a little crispy on the outside periodtoken id also prefer periodtoken more crisp than fatty piece of belly inside but hey look whos being contradictory now make up ya mind commatoken tone periodtoken anyways commatoken i was surprised at how much i loved the fried rice in my salmon taco periodtoken i actually enjoyed a few forkfuls on its own throughout the course periodtoken but even still commatoken almost all of the portions are a little small for the price periodtoken quality is important though here commatoken and i feel they nail it periodtoken   the atmosphere is definitely another pro periodtoken if you dont like noise commatoken go away periodtoken people are having fun and

guess what periodtoken periodtoken i hate sours periodtoken dont get me wrong commatoken ive had a few of their beers that i have really enjoyed commatoken but overall i think this place is over hyped periodtoken my thought is they just try to get too eccentric commatoken and just get a little nutty with their concoctions periodtoken like i said commatoken i dont hate it commatoken but i rarely love it periodtoken ill still keep going though periodtoken the atmosphere commatoken food commatoken and occasional slam dunk brew still reels me in periodtoken","6237":"i was here with a friend of

probably the low point of the plate periodtoken  the falafels were heavily fried  had little taste periodtoken  ive had superior falafel almost anywhere else periodtoken  the plate came with large scoops of labneh commatoken baba ganoush commatoken  hummus periodtoken  all three tasted very good periodtoken  in fact the baba ganoush had a nice subtle smoky flavor  that was very appealing periodtoken  my wife ordered the chicken schwaarma which i helped her eat periodtoken  we thought it was very tasty periodtoken  the waitress we had was excellent periodtoken  the music however was not so good periodtoken  it was blaring out of ancient ceiling speakers which were low quality  seemed to be torn periodtoken  the music was tinny  would get full of static  the volume would fade then

periodtoken the concept is clever burger patties in a burrito commatoken taco salad commatoken sandwich commatoken etc periodtoken  let me start by saying the amount of love and attention that they put into the hatch green chile sauce and their cajun sauce is noticeable and makes these sauces stellar periodtoken       now the problem is that they dont pay as much love and attention to the other parts of the whole periodtoken i ordered a taco salad which comes with the green chile sauce commatoken diced hamburger patty beef or turkey commatoken chopped tomato commatoken chopped onion commatoken all on top of a bed of lettuce and surrounded with tortilla chips periodtoken i had two problems with this dish  1 periodtoken the hamburger was diced and not ground periodtoken 2 periodtoken the hamburger was a frozen patty periodtoken         i really feel like this food truck has potential to be outstanding if only they put the same amount of love into all items of each dish

periodtoken","6249":"nice place to stop and eat periodtoken we go just about every sunday for breakfast periodtoken no matter which waitress we get they are always friendly and get our orders right

be very busy with work and hard to reach periodtoken  it took several phone calls and emails to hear back from them commatoken although the manager explained theyve been having some trouble with their phone system periodtoken  we went over all of my event details and i made a couple of small changes to the menu commatoken including selecting a glutenfree and vegetarian entree commatoken for those guests with special dietary needs periodtoken  i talked to her at length about which appetizers and entrees are glutenfree because im allergic to gluten commatoken as are many other people commatoken and we settled on some good choices periodtoken  fast forward to a few days before my event when the event coordinator commatoken a different woman commatoken called me and proceeded to run down the whole thing with me again because she didnt have the notes from my call with the owner periodtoken  i again stressed the menu changes and the importance of having glutenfree items periodtoken  on the day of the event commatoken i discovered that they had swapped out one of the entrees i specifically requested and that was listed on the final menu invoice for a red bell pepper stuffed with couscous

tight and cozy periodtoken the kitchen is open faced and there are coffee mugs commatoken the menu commatoken and a listing of the specials to greet you right at the door periodtoken   i ordered the bread pudding french toast and my husband ordered a basic breakfast plate periodtoken the french toast was good commatoken the eggs my husband had were extraordinary and i really liked the direction

family and we are big fan of pad thai so we ordered it too periodtoken that was a bummer periodtoken it was red and taste different than the all other pad thai ive eaten in my life periodtoken i would go back there just to eat the spare rib dish and some tea periodtoken","6307":"love the concept and luckily when we walked into this small commatoken quaint little place on the pier commatoken there

cayenne pepper periodtoken i have had clam chowder all over the world and sadly commatoken i cannot recommend this once periodtoken it needed some creaminess butt hat could be personal opinion periodtoken get a cup if you are unsure like we did commatoken a bowl of it is a big commitment periodtoken there were a lot of people working and things came out very quickly periodtoken  hubby had a local beer which he enjoyed and i had a glass of wine periodtoken a glass of wine here means a glass commatoken loved it periodtoken no frills here commatoken wine right to the top of a glass you would get at your grannys house periodtoken we split the fried platter with calamari commatoken shrimp and scallops for 13 periodtoken not a ton of food  3 pieces of each maybe but the coleslaw complete with raisins and pineapple was a treat and they also throw on about 3 large onion rings periodtoken this was a nice dish to split so we did not ingest too much fried food periodtoken there is also the option to have fried oysters on it which we skipped periodtoken i imagine the more you order on the plate commatoken the less you get of each periodtoken i would for sure come back here periodtoken unpretentious and even a little gritty periodtoken come as you are periodtoken if you want fine dining commatoken there are other options on the pier periodtoken they will validate your parking if you park on the wharf periodtoken","6311":"i thought it was marginal given all the hype periodtoken i was under the impression that the burritos were relatively large  i guess mostly just full of rice periodtoken also choosing steak was a mistake  it was all kinds of chewy and gristly periodtoken id go again if someone else wanted to and id probably get something else periodtoken","6312":"baileys ditched the duck burger   i am devastated  it was one of the best burgers ive ever had periodtoken sigh periodtoken   had a pumpkin bean veggie burger on their special list once with an apple relish type thing and it was kind of a flop not well balanced and had too many competing flavors to taste any individual one periodtoken not to mention i left the restaurant forgetting my leftovers commatoken barely took 3 steps outside commatoken and when i returned for my box it was already taken and lost   but their shakes are wonderful recommend the salted caramel and they have a solid local beer selection periodtoken   why commatoken baileys commatoken why do you torment me so  signed commatoken               your duck burger lover","6315":"best cappuccino served

good but not great periodtoken it was the hand tossed  the dough commatoken sauce commatoken cheese and toppings were good commatoken but a bit too much bread vs other things periodtoken the price was way too high considering the size and product periodtoken the service was exceptional we had our pie delivered in only 20 minutes and people were very friendly periodtoken  we may try again but since

and chicken periodtoken  there however is one issue i have with the new chicken sandwich periodtoken   there are no other offerings on the menu to balance out the intensity of the flavor of the chicken periodtoken   my chicken was a bit dry because it was in the fryer a bit too long but on average the sandwich is phenomenal periodtoken  but its an intense sandwich with a lot of flavor periodtoken   i do wish theyd lighten up on the powder flavoring maybe just one side of the chicken  but in order for me to enjoy this  sandwich to its fullest potential it needs some french fries or some cole slaw something periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the price point is a bit high for 7 but seeing that they spend so much effort behind each sandwich its a bit to be expected i guess periodtoken   however in this town were not about over paying for food periodtoken","6324":"cyranos is known for its desserts and its pink interior periodtoken remember in steel magnolias when they say the church looks like its been sprayed with pepto bismol commatoken they were also talking about cyranos periodtoken the desserts here are good and if you live in the neighborhood dont want to go much farther commatoken thats perfect periodtoken otherwise commatoken there are better places to go for desserts periodtoken like a bakery periodtoken","6325":"for a place with brewpub in the title commatoken i dont consider this a great place to go for beer periodtoken they seem to run out of selections a lot and it is never cold periodtoken i guess thats part of the whole english vibe its not so bad in the winter when im going for a darker beer commatoken but if im having a light beer on the patio on a hot day commatoken i want a cold beer that said commatoken the outdoor space is really nice when its warm commatoken the bar has a cozy fireplace when its not commatoken and the food has never disappointed periodtoken the menu changes a lot commatoken so there isnt any one thing i can point to commatoken but the specials are typically on point periodtoken","6327":"delicious food and cheap on the pier periodtoken dont recommend the fried foods because the plate only had a few shrimp and scallops periodtoken the clam chowder and pasta were delicious wish they werent out of spider crabs  wanted to try their in house special the onion rings were good too  if youre in a hurry or want to eat outdoors thee is a side window that has much quicker service","6329":"when we go to reno commatoken we like stopping at panda express sometimes for the good tasting chinese food periodtoken its quick service and the people are friendly periodtoken  my favorite is orange chicken with rice and my wife likes the chicken chow mein periodtoken we always get a 2item combo with rice and a drink

telling me that i need to try a five guys burger because it was the most amazing thing on this earth according to rumor periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni did periodtoken its absurd the amount of times i felt like i had somehow offended someone on some deep seeded personal level because i had not had a five a guys experience periodtoken i figured commatoken man commatoken what a loyal fan base periodtoken they must know what they are doing periodtoken i tried not to get my expectations up too high from all the hype commatoken but it was hard not to expect some sort of spiritual and divine cheeseburger religious experience periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i got a cheeseburger commatoken a regular cajun fries commatoken and a coke periodtoken and man i wish i split that order with someone i didnt realize that a regular cheeseburger was a double patty if i had known i probably would have ordered the little burger instead which i assumed was a junior cheeseburger but come to find out its actually a normal sized burger periodtoken also commatoken i love my burger fully dressed and at five guys commatoken fully dressed comes with mayo commatoken lettuce commatoken tomato commatoken pickles commatoken grilled onions commatoken and grilled mushrooms periodtoken plus theres more toppings available upon request periodtoken so between the toppings and the double patty it all certainly adds up to be a pretty hefty burger periodtoken   the cajun fries where great but super salty from the all the seasoning they put on them commatoken so i probably drank enough coke to be made of coke by the time i left  good thing theres free refills periodtoken  the free peanuts are a cool idea periodtoken not like you have any time to eat them since the food comes out super fast there was tons of people there and huge line almost out the door when i showed up at peak lunch hour but they kept it moving quickly and i barely had time to fill my drink and pick a table before my order was up periodtoken   this place is nothing if not pure efficiency ill say that much periodtoken they hustled so much behind the counter that i felt like i needed to swipe on an apron and help out myself   the staff was very friendly and the girl taking my order was great at explaining how everything worked periodtoken   i know a big complaint at five guys is the cost periodtoken but for a double patty burger commatoken giant fry portions and a drink i cant really complain at 11 periodtoken plus i probably wont ever order that much food in the future periodtoken next time ill probably get a small fries and a little cheeseburger instead of regular fries and a regular cheeseburger periodtoken  pros fast and friendly service commatoken big portions commatoken fairly priced periodtoken  cons i found the patties to be a bit on the thin size but it certainly didnt disappoint periodtoken","6337":"a cosy little neighborhood taco joint periodtoken good food commatoken fair price periodtoken weird tip situation commatoken bring cash periodtoken","6338":"this is a nice little indoor snowball spot where you can sit and eat at a table if you want periodtoken  they specialize in stuffing their snowballs with cheesecake here and have come up with some really interesting combinations periodtoken  they use a snowizard machine so the ice isnt quite as fine as hansens but the cheesecake addition and the creative flavoring twists make this a worthy place to grab a treat at periodtoken","6340":"i give them three stars on behalf of the staff commatoken they are real cool commatoken the que is not commatoken real tough ribs","6341":"food was decent commatoken if a bit pricey periodtoken   the home fries werent fresh commatoken but were the little frozen cubes periodtoken   the omelette was very good commatoken but my green tea was some herbal concoction that was super strong periodtoken   if i was in the area again i would probably try something else periodtoken","6342":"hey periodtoken not too bad periodtoken the brew is great periodtoken waitress should of checked on us more often though periodtoken if they step it up a little commatoken then its a good 4 star spot periodtoken","6346":"i think 3 stars is generous periodtoken its really a 2 periodtoken5 periodtoken the staff was really friendly commatoken restaurant was clean commatoken and food was fast periodtoken thats just it periodtoken its fast food periodtoken i went with a basic famous star burger and it was identical to a whopper from burger king periodtoken this was my first

periodtoken","6347":"our concierge recommended this place for a late lunch periodtoken  we had huge po boys  my catfish po boy was very flavorful periodtoken  the fries that came with it were meh periodtoken  we were happy with what we ate commatoken and we were so full for the rest of the day commatoken we didnt have dinner  we thought that the prices were okay periodtoken  one of the less expensive places we ate at in nola commatoken but also more casual periodtoken  i would definitely pick this place over the food court at the riverwalk if youre at the convention center periodtoken","6349":"i stopped at gelateria del leone on a wednesday afternoon for a quick little afternoon pick me up periodtoken  i ordered a small cinnamon gelato periodtoken  its a cute place and i have been before and enjoyed it but on this day i wasnt feeling it periodtoken  the cinnamon gelato had some ice crystals in it periodtoken  this led me to believe maybe it wasnt so fresh  it doesnt help that i have had the vietnamese cinnamon ice cream at clementines creamery two times now and it blows me away periodtoken  this paled in comparison periodtoken  sorry gelateria periodtoken  i also felt like the selection looked a little sparse periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6352":"yeah not much to say about since its a typical fast food joint that has a pretty big variety periodtoken weve all seen the commercials periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the only thing i really have to say about this location is be careful when going through the drivethru at night periodtoken it happens every time i go periodtoken they always forget something in my order periodtoken usually its just an item or some sauces that we asked for that they forgot to put in periodtoken other times they give just one ketchup packet for a large order periodtoken weve had whole meals missing periodtoken instead of a large curly fries weve gotten a small order of regular fries before periodtoken i think the worst one ever was a jumbo jack with cheese commatoken but there was no meat patty periodtoken some how jumbo jack with cheese was turned into a grilled cheese yeah that one sucked because we checked the bag before leaving periodtoken","6354":"ive lived here for about 5 years but never even ate here because i was scared of the reviews solid commatoken quick commatoken but i could def see that many items were low or gone and options were limited as a result periodtoken id recommend getting half chow mein and fried rice as the base  portions provided in the combos arent always even which is a bit disappointing opening your box and seeing mostly a small portion of mostly green beans with 3 pieces of chicken in a 23 item combo periodtoken orange chicken is usually on point periodtoken the beef with broccoli was alright commatoken slightly sketchy taste but beware of the sauce cause it can spill all over the bag and everywhere and be a no fun why did i choose you mess  i was surprised to see how long the line can get for this place i like how they offer you hot sauce when you leave now and wish they had the sweet  sour soup here also","6360":"pretty good pizza periodtoken  very quiet location nestled in the mall periodtoken  doenst deliver commatoken but they do have take out specials periodtoken  if you decide to dine in commatoken they also have good specials on beer and pitchers periodtoken  the wait staff was very friendly and attentive periodtoken","6361":"i shop with my mom here frequently periodtoken  my mom has a love affair with walmart for some reason periodtoken  this is by far the cleanest walmart on the south side periodtoken  i usually can find most of what i am looking for here periodtoken  lately i have been headed a more organic commatoken grass fed beef route and less of a processed food direction periodtoken  i havent went all crazy yet and threw out the captain crunch but making small changes periodtoken   it seems that overall most grocery stores on this side of town are missing the mark on offering those type of items and walmart is no different periodtoken  i usually do not buy anything that is fresh here just because of the fact it is a superstore and i dont like the idea of someone ahead of me purchasing fertilizer commatoken weed killer commatoken manure whatever and then me putting my food on the same belt for the cashier periodtoken  it kinda grosses me out so i just stick with fully packaged items periodtoken  the parking lot congestion is really high especially by the building and trying to get out periodtoken  will i be back periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenof course every sunday with my mom periodtoken","6363":"only eaten here once commatoken the food was good periodtoken traditional

they close at 530pm monday through saturday and they close at 400pm on sunday periodtoken  sure commatoken the quality isnt always topnotch commatoken but i tend to look at what i pick out at least the stuff on the selfserve tables before i put it in my basket periodtoken  and at their prices commatoken i have no problem throwing out some stuff thats gone bad periodtoken  small onions are 5lb for 2 commatoken so if a few go bad before i can get through all 5lb commatoken oh well periodtoken  half the time anything that goes bad was good to start and i wasnt able to go through it all periodtoken  its not just good prices commatoken but its also bulk produce  its like costco commatoken but just for produce  i spent 45 there today periodtoken  my biggest complaint would be that they only take cash periodtoken  the whole lack of receipts thing bugs me commatoken too periodtoken  they do have an atm there commatoken though commatoken so its not a huge problem periodtoken  honestly commatoken i dont think the traffic is a reason to knock off stars for pj periodtoken  its not their fault periodtoken  there is a light right there  if youre going to pj commatoken turn at the light and then go into the parking lot periodtoken  or drive past commatoken go downtown and turn around in one of the parking lots and come back from the other direction periodtoken  i like going to pj periodtoken  im lucky that im also within walking distance periodtoken  its worth the walk periodtoken","6368":"prices are great and the food is flavorful periodtoken  5th street benedict was delish commatoken however commatoken the bread of our steak sandwich was literally sticky dough and the steak was tough and fatty periodtoken","6369":"i feel bad here periodtoken  maybe i missed something  i live local and keep seeing all of the positive reviews periodtoken  my wife was in the mood for something new so we gave andale a try periodtoken  well commatoken lets see commatoken the portions are a 4 outta 5 periodtoken  i think they are appropriate and certainly worth the pricing commatoken 5 outta 5 periodtoken  i did not get the same customer service feel as others on this forum periodtoken  i did order to pick up commatoken but i am not sure if the guy on the other end of the phone understood the menu periodtoken  although he was kinda nice commatoken definitely not rude periodtoken  going in the restaurant commatoken cleanliness was a 3 outta 5 periodtoken  i like the concept and appreciate the home made recipes commatoken but the food was a bit bland periodtoken  not super tasty

periodtoken","6370":"truthfully commatoken not sure what the hype is about periodtoken certainly a solid variety of pancakes commatoken but the quality is not above what you can throw together out of a store box mix periodtoken the sign outside boasts that theyve offered 23 varieties since they opened 50 years ago commatoken but waitress informed us that they no longer sell the potato pancakes periodtoken we ended up getting the swiss chocolate 5 regular pancakes with a ton of chocolate chips dumped on top commatoken georgia peach 3 regular pancakes rolled to cover a peach compote commatoken and blintzes 3 small rolls periodtoken glad we didnt have to wait longer than 10 min on a tuesday morning periodtoken wouldve been quite disappointed if we stood in one of those infamous lines only to taste mediocrity periodtoken plenty of other great breakfast options in town periodtoken i recommend loveless cafe periodtoken","6371":"we had a great time chowing down at this little italianpizza joint periodtoken be warned that while all of my friends tried their pizza and loved it commatoken i did not partake periodtoken also commatoken there is technically parking available

the appetizers commatoken including greco salad commatoken the broccolini caesar salad commatoken the roasted bronzino commatoken crispy artichokes commatoken meatball commatoken chicken parm commatoken asparagus commatoken octopus commatoken short ribs commatoken and a multitude of pizzas including margherita commatoken eggplant commatoken mushroom and zucchii and cipolla periodtoken while i cant speak much about the pizza commatoken but heard great things about the cipolla commatoken i really enjoyed the two salads commatoken especially the broccolini and the spicy chicken parm periodtoken the asparagus and artichokes were a bit too overoiled or fried for my taste periodtoken the short ribs were decent but just also a bit too fatty periodtoken the octopus was a tad bit on the chewy side and given how much it cost with how little were on the plate commatoken id likely not get it in the future periodtoken i think if you want to eat frugally commatoken the pizza and salad combination is likely the way to go commatoken as the antipasti can add up commatoken but overall commatoken its a decent commatoken but expensive little italian joint periodtoken  food 34 stars

they also offer some traditional jewish breads that you might not find anywhere else in the area periodtoken  i never tried any of the jewish breads and dont have any point of comparison to know if

toppings that you can eat commatoken not a smoothie in a bowl periodtoken not impressed periodtoken its not horrible commatoken but i wouldnt go there again periodtoken i asked why they blend it all and they said it is because the ingredients are frozen periodtoken assuming they do this to cut down on costs periodtoken if you want to have toppings to eat that are not blended then its a dollar a

certainly better private clubs in nola periodtoken   as time passed most of the people i know realized that they really didnt get a lot of value out of their memberships so they dropped out

commatoken drinking periodtoken  my wife had a raspberry ale which was a little too fruity for me periodtoken  i tried the charming wit and was immediately smitten periodtoken  well lets just say i liked it a lot periodtoken  this was a kid friendly event so there was plenty of cold water on tap for the kids periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the warehouse was not air conditioned and the few

2 hours commatoken at which time my kid was getting too hot as were several other kids periodtoken  there was live music courtesy of artist steve wulff commatoken and a zydeco band whose name i cannot recall followed him periodtoken  there were two food trucks outside and the crepe cart inside with part of the proceeds going to hie periodtoken  unless this venue was being used for another charity event such as hops for hope commatoken i would not recommend going here from the months of june through september as the heat was stifling periodtoken  however commatoken during the months of march

the concerts are general admission and everyone packs into the concert hall commatoken with no options for seating on the main floor periodtoken  depending on where in the knit you are at commatoken you may or may not have a good view and you may or may not be smothered by other attendees periodtoken  seeing a show here commatoken i was not sure what to expect periodtoken  i was pleasant

protein in the meat dishes we almost never finish both our curries periodtoken  their naan is good but not the best that ive had periodtoken  i like their eggplant vegetarian curry although some people may not like that there is no texture to it becuase the eggplant is mushed up periodtoken  the chicken tikka masala and biryani are good but we prefer the lamb korma and the house special makhani chicken periodtoken  the saag is also very delicious and the chili chicken is very good but it tastes more like a chinese dish because the chicken is fried and there isnt really a curry sauce periodtoken  their buffet is reliable commatoken cheap and good as well but the atmosphere is a bit dingy so i prefer delivery periodtoken  they usually take about 3040 minutes to the domus on 34th and chestnut periodtoken","6420":"does this place have some of the best donuts in the world if they dont i am shocked periodtoken  i had a donut in here that i can only discribe as outstanding periodtoken fantastic commatoken fabulous periodtoken the second one i had was just meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i was kind of disappointed periodtoken i have been here several times and i cannot seem to get a consistent product periodtoken a donut that is fresh and yummy one day is dry and bland another periodtoken   the service moves at a moderate pace periodtoken the first visit commatoken the place was packed and it took a while periodtoken the second time commatoken the place was empty and the service took even longer periodtoken they were almost out of coffee and gave us three half filled cups of warm coffee periodtoken it tasted old periodtoken if you have brew commatoken right on your sign commatoken shouldnt you have fresh coffee at all times just saying periodtoken  i have tried the sliders commatoken and they are very tasty with quality ingredients commatoken but they are a bit pricey periodtoken  this place is often a madhouse with horrible parking commatoken but i continue to go back periodtoken if you are ever walking down magazine and want a little break commatoken try it out periodtoken","6424":"teetering between 3 and 3 12 stars periodtoken 12 star extra for the location and surprising lack of sit down restaurants within walking distance to clearwater beach near the pier periodtoken lots of fried options and a few broiled platters on the menu periodtoken   cute decor and live music on the downstairs periodtoken we sat upstairs and couldnt hear the music periodtoken  we ordered the spinach crab dip for starter periodtoken served with extremely salty chips periodtoken it had a layer of unappetizing hardened cheese on the top but once u got that bad boy outta the way it was decent periodtoken good deal during happy hour for beer periodtoken on to my lobster roll periodtoken i used to go out to montauk for my fix and this wasnt as good periodtoken a bit under seasoned but otherwise ok periodtoken  hubs got the broiled seafood and i tasted the scallops periodtoken worst ive ever tasted periodtoken  service was ok but kitchen mustve been backed up even though it wasnt too crowded periodtoken","6426":"i guess im in the minority here commatoken but i didnt love bandit coffee periodtoken  a coffee shop needs a few things to me  it needs good coffee commatoken but it should also be comfortable with good work stations commatoken wifi obviously so that if this is where youre going to sit and work or chill for a while commatoken you dont feel like your tailbone is going through your neck periodtoken  bandit has good coffee and if youre in a pinch and want a cup to go commatoken then coming here is a great option periodtoken  but if youre looking for a place to work commatoken or read a book or newspaper yes commatoken some people still read those commatoken then i dont think this is the place for you periodtoken  it is very modern and open commatoken but their seating arrangements are bars or tables with these metal stools to sit on periodtoken  basically the opposite of comfort periodtoken  i like the floor to ceiling windows commatoken so you get a lot of natural light commatoken and maybe this is the kind of layout millennials are looking for periodtoken  maybe young adults in their 20s like this sterile environment and dont mind a breaking chairs periodtoken  perhaps they like metal stools because its really frustrating when a bar fight breaks out and you hit someone with a wooden stool commatoken and it shatters commatoken leaving you without a weapon for the next drunk idiot periodtoken  but this is a coffee shop commatoken not an english pub periodtoken    i like my coffee shops being more homely  some comfortable couches and chairs around commatoken and absent that commatoken seating arrangements that make me able to sit and work or read for longer than 30 minutes periodtoken","6427":"i expected something totally different in terms of atmosphere and display periodtoken the music was some poppy radio station and it did not have the elegance of maple street but the cherry cobbler i purchased was delicious periodtoken  i was irritated commatoken

morning to check out the coffee here periodtoken  the cafe options for good coffee are sparse between the washington square neighborhood and center city and i had grown tired of looking at the empty ethnics space commatoken the good karma cafe is a welcome addition to the neighborhood periodtoken    i ordered an iced coffee  its good to know they come in two sizes  16 and 20 oz commatoken along with a shot of espresso at no additional charge commatoken and that they also carry soy milk periodtoken  i decided to sit down with a magazine and my coffee and take in the atmosphere of the new space its very open and still feels a bit empty somewhat lacking the cozy atmosphere that makes a cafe seem so inviting periodtoken  i went to take a seat in the side room towards the back of the space commatoken but the air felt a bit stuffy there so moved towards the front periodtoken  the music added a nice chilled out vibe commatoken and the large paintings added some color to the otherwise white walls periodtoken    the space up front near the counter is a bit barren commatoken with the exception of two notsopretty drink coolers it would be nice to see more tables here commatoken or a counter with some stools periodtoken  there is also an atm inside commatoken nice i suppose if you need a bit of extra cash not sure if the cafe takes cards periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhowever commatoken it would be nicer if the sound on the machine could be turned off it beeps loudly every time a button is pressed kind of distracting if you are reading or studying periodtoken additionally commatoken with the size of the space commatoken before they opened commatoken i was expecting more of a cafe the kind that serves soups and sandwiches commatoken in addition to coffee commatoken tea etc periodtoken commatoken maybe this will happen eventually  it would really be nice to have a quick sandwichsnack option in the neighborhood periodtoken  all things aside commatoken i know theyve only been open for about a week and a half and are still getting used to the new space commatoken so ill definitely return periodtoken","6444":"my experience at sliced was just fine periodtoken  my reuben was really good periodtoken  the broccoli and cheese soup was not overly cheesy and had good consistency periodtoken  however commatoken the soup lacked salt and was incredibly hot commatoken making me believe it was reheated in a microwave periodtoken   i was expecting a larger selection of soups than the three they had on the menu periodtoken  ill go back and see if the options are different commatoken or if they are the standard periodtoken  overall commatoken a nice change of pace commatoken but nothing exceptional from the other soupsaladsandwich places in the area periodtoken","6446":"the service always seems to be slow or in different periodtoken the hostess was by the kitchen to keep warm she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar commatoken even though we said to seat us away from the door periodtoken  while sitting commatoken 4 tables were left dirty for 1015 minutes by the time we left periodtoken  the food was just placed on the table even

much that can be said periodtoken  this one is open 24 hours and is good for a late night snack periodtoken  i was coming home from an event held in st periodtoken pete and needed a quick soda periodtoken the wait for the drivethru took longer than usual periodtoken but commatoken this is to be expected late on a weekend night periodtoken   not a huge fan of this drivethru periodtoken the

somehow i knew that would happen periodtoken it was very late and i didnt want deal with the hassle of letting the restaurant know periodtoken so commatoken i just decided to deal it with periodtoken

cant comment on the atmosphere much commatoken but the strips and fries are delicious periodtoken nice crispy chicken commatoken always ready on time periodtoken 15 for a 6 piece commatoken but its enough to feed both me and my husband periodtoken   they will only include sauce if you ask for it periodtoken their signature is a sweet and hot sauce periodtoken its good","6457":"we went here on a whim and the service was really great commatoken my food was really good commatoken but the rest my party was not too thrilled with their meals periodtoken for reference commatoken i got the twisted southern chicken periodtoken the chicken was perfectly cooked commatoken the corn and potatoes were really great periodtoken  two people in my party got the short rib mac n cheese and it wasnt really what we pictured when brought out to the table and the feedback was that it was really greasy and neither of them finished their meals commatoken which says a lot commatoken since theyre both guys and finish everything periodtoken i cant even remember what the dish was that we ordered commatoken but the same thing was said about that periodtoken too greasy and it wasnt finished periodtoken   personally commatoken i would give it a shot again commatoken but i dont think anyone else would periodtoken","6461":"the pizza was good  the service was really good and the guys working very friendly

though","6462":"the shop is cute and everything is displayed beautifully periodtoken  there is no lot nearby so parking may be weird but its worth having to walk a few blocks in my opinion periodtoken  the items were all gorgeous commatoken no sloppy frosting or whatever else here commatoken you can tell the bakers really care about their work periodtoken  i found the prices a tad high to be honest but having gone through  most of my haul commatoken the quality is top notch and is definitely worth the splurge every now and again periodtoken between me and my parents were got a little of everything and i really recommend the red velvet cake the best cake ive ever had seriously and the various bars key lime and lemon are not to be missed periodtoken   my major complaint was nothing had prices on it commatoken so you had to ask constantly and when i went it was very busy so that quickly became a hassle periodtoken  also commatoken the women at the counter seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by the crowd so things didnt run as smoothly as they should have it was early afternoon on a weekday periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenstill busy but im sure saturday or sunday mornings are worse periodtoken maybe management should look into getting some extra help   i did want to shout out to the women at the counter though commatoken someone came in to pick up a special order cake for the kentucky derby of all things and there was some very minor issue with it that the woman was very upset over unneeded in my opinion the issue had no effect on her ability to enjoy the cake it was purely aesthetic and truly a small detail and the woman helping her was very kind and understanding and considerate when dealing with this drama queen periodtoken","6464":"this place was okay they didnt have many flavors but they did have some ive never tried before which was cool periodtoken i got there 45 mins before closing and felt like i was in the way of their cleaning duties commatoken and even though i finished eating at 930 i felt uncomfortable hanging around periodtoken they had a lot of topping options but not peanut butter commatoken this is my favorite topping to add so im hoping they get some in the near future periodtoken","6473":"aesthetics is great love the vibe and desert martinis are delicious but the traditional fare was uneven periodtoken especially the  grilled

loyalty card program periodtoken i filled up my card buying mostly the regular size snowsmoothies periodtoken but then when i tried to use the card commatoken regular size was a 50 cent upsell periodtoken i think they even charged me for boba periodtoken it just pissed me off periodtoken bad enough that i didnt come back for a year periodtoken sure it is only 50 cents or whatever but it was the principle periodtoken  it didnt make me feel like a special customer periodtoken it made me feel like a chump periodtoken","6477":"i dont normally shop at whole foods because their prices are so out of line with other grocers in town periodtoken however i am having such a time getting rid of a colony of ants in my apartment making it impossible to cook there that i needed some prepared food

commatoken you cannot sample a variety beers available in tennessee periodtoken  the staff is friendly and the girl i spoke to knew her shtthats a big positive periodtoken   the downside of the fs is the  beers available in tennessee bit i mentioned periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthere just arent that many of the nations greatest beers available here periodtoken  thats not a failure of the fs commatoken thats a failure of a political culture that treats high gravity beer as magically separate and hence discourages most great breweries from even attempting to negotiate the treacherous waters of a bipartite distribution system periodtoken  but i digress periodtoken  the fs is a great local resource periodtoken  check them out","6493":"everyone in this place was rude it seems like everyone was in a rush even though it wasnt busy periodtoken  we didnt even get to finish ordering before they were trying to end the transaction and seemed annoyed when we tried to update our order

extremely thin and runny commatoken almost like water commatoken and has no taste periodtoken   but like the ketchup commatoken the place tries to be unique and become the first burger place to cater

fritter was decent and i would eat it again periodtoken the batter for the other two donuts was really dry and floury probably the same dough but fritter ingredients helped periodtoken they were some of the worst donuts i have ever tried periodtoken the topping on the gooey butter cake was okay but needed more of the cream to counteract the dryness of the donut periodtoken   i give them a bonus star for being open until 12 am on weekends because it is awesome to be able to get a donut late periodtoken however commatoken if deciding between going to a krispy kreme with a neon hot now sign on or strange donuts commatoken i would pick krispy kreme every time and probably eat a half dozen periodtoken","6514":"i am giving 3 stars but i wont be back periodtoken its simply too expensive

glad it wasnt filled with more periodtoken  the price was good commatoken the donuts were ok periodtoken maybe it was just a bad batch because so many people on here seem to love it commatoken but i wont be back to see periodtoken","6526":"open til 3 am for those late night hunger crawls but be willing to throw some bows because this small little fast food joint is packed in the wee hours of the

garlic and slices of ginger periodtoken    the scallion pancakes were also good but i can get the same thing out of the freezer section at an asian grocery store periodtoken  but the sauce they comes with the pancakes  delicious  if they got said sauce from a bottle commatoken please let me know what its called and where i can find it  the braised beef noodle soup was nice periodtoken  the broth was a little lacking in flavor but nothing i cant fix periodtoken  the noodles would have been better if they used fresh egg noodles in lieu of the linguini type noodle they use but its just a personal preference periodtoken  the beef was tender and easily fell apart commatoken definitely a must order especially when its cold and rainy outside periodtoken  the oyster pancake was not our

door with my friend commatoken i noticed the outdoor dog park and benches periodtoken  although a great idea commatoken the first smell i had walking into this new establishment was pizza commatoken grass commatoken and dog shit periodtoken    the interior can be easily mistaken for a high end italian restaurant periodtoken  everything was redone from the old restaurant and definitely had a continental feel for it periodtoken    i headed out back where they recently added the outdoor patio periodtoken  service was excellent as we never ran dry periodtoken  there was actually a yelpsponsored event where a handful of strangers formed minicircles as they got to know each other like a speeddate event periodtoken  eh commatoken id do it for the free food and drinks periodtoken  the pizza wasnt bad periodtoken  not sure how else to describe it periodtoken  i felt like the toppings were good commatoken but the crush was soggy and i felt like i had to struggle keeping the

regular gardenburger patty they probably took out of the freezer periodtoken    what i did love was the onion rings periodtoken  amazing onion rings  seriously commatoken what kind of batter did they use  my bf felt like it tastes like the same batter used for crunchy fried shrimp periodtoken  the onions were cooked perfectly so that when you bite into the ring commatoken you actually bite off the onion cleanly without dragging any of it out of the breading periodtoken  perfectly crunchy with flavor periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken mmmmmm  this location made it look like a holeinthewall

positive i love the space periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it is bright and very bold commatoken the service was good when they were paying attention commatoken they let you try as many flavors as

expected for the small container that you get commatoken the sprinkles were gross i had to waste part of the gelato to get them off in my opinion they tasted like foam commatoken or what i think foam

commatoken bar area open and airy with large windows and bigscreen tvs for sports fans commatoken etc periodtoken the main dining area is your typical grid layout with a large buffet area deep in the area commatoken serving sunday brunch periodtoken appeared very clean and wellorganized and decorated periodtoken   hostess typical 20something with long hair and an unnatural habit of saying like

up to the front counter at the time we were ready to be seated periodtoken   server nice enough periodtoken really i mean really pushed the brunch buffet periodtoken  i wonder why i guess its the most commonpopular sunday afternoon choice took a while to obtain actual menus but not an intolerable amount of time periodtoken interesting that commatoken even though this was our first trip here

okay periodtoken the server was good commatoken not great periodtoken the food was good periodtoken no dealbreakers here commatoken but no real reasons for me to activate the culinary phonetree and

table and then to my delight i saw a whole shelf of games you can play at your table periodtoken so commatoken after grabbing the last cards against humanity we played at the table for an hour laughing way to loud and making horrible card combinations periodtoken since we stuck to sitting at a table we relied on a waitress and i have to say service was pretty slow and they were not super

fries were perfect periodtoken   the service was slow commatoken but the server was pleasant periodtoken my water wasnt refilled the entire time i was there and my colleague had to fetch her twice to get another beer periodtoken that may simply have been because it was an event night and the bar was pretty busy periodtoken im told thats not typical periodtoken if youre in the area commatoken and

staff was nice and the place was clean periodtoken the food was ok but a bit over priced for what you get periodtoken","6606":"a restaurant has to have a hook these days commatoken and one of baileys is the dairycowrustic farm theme commatoken right down to the milk can lights and assortment of old windows over the central community table in the bar area periodtoken the first floor is open to the second floor commatoken lending itself to increased noise level commatoken which it was the night we were there periodtoken burger joints seem to be the in thing and this is a burger joint commatoken but definitely an upscale one commatoken both in their offerings and their prices periodtoken   another hook is the option to have your burger made from a variety of sources bison commatoken lamb commatoken beef commatoken pork commatoken chicken or veggie periodtoken all cooked to order and on your choice of bun periodtoken some of their condiments were unfamiliar to our group sriracho mayo commatoken rooster sauce periodtoken all in all commatoken an interesting concept periodtoken our burgers were good commatoken but we all agreed they didnt make it on our best ever list periodtoken and 1112 for a burger is pretty steep in my world  youre obviously paying for the concept  cutesy atmosphere rather than a wellexecuted burger periodtoken and when you add in drinks and dessert commatoken it ends up being a pretty pricey night out commatoken especially with a family periodtoken  service was soso periodtoken the hostesses seemed preoccupied with their own conversation periodtoken our server was friendly and answered all our questions about the menu commatoken but she was pretty much mia after she took our order periodtoken we didnt order dessert commatoken and after reading other reviews commatoken sounds like we missed out on the one thing baileys does exceptionally well periodtoken","6607":"3stars for being good commatoken but over priced periodtoken unless you are  a senior commatoken then you get a good deal commatoken and it is well worth it periodtoken    usually the place is either empty or near empty in the morning periodtoken  and its most often seniors who are there periodtoken it really is a nice place periodtoken we also really think that it is usually really empty because it is really over priced periodtoken  i mean there are often more staff than customers in the morningafternoon because they have prices that keep people away periodtoken  seriously omelet commatoken toast commatoken and coffee is near 15 commatoken and with wife its near 30 periodtoken  i would like to give the place a better review as we like it there periodtoken however we also feel stupid for spending that much on eggs and toast periodtoken  we  only go there when our parents are visiting as the senior deal is a good deal for  them periodtoken","6611":"interesting st periodtoken louis tradition periodtoken have many st periodtoken louis friends who have told me about it  before i ever tried it periodtoken but im from milwaukee which lays claim to being the original custard location leons  commatoken of tvs happy days series and where its a

nice variations periodtoken i love sour cherries and even in wisconsin commatoken all you get is bing cherries in custard periodtoken drewes sour cherry and hot fudge is a great experiment periodtoken next time commatoken however commatoken i want to try it just plain to make a comparison with milwaukee periodtoken","6612":"to clarify commatoken i did not mean to imply nor did i say that the restaurant had no french influence or dishes periodtoken  the menu is fine commatoken its mainly the bread that i hope will be improved periodtoken  to me commatoken good french baguette has a crusty commatoken brown exterior commatoken and an airy interior periodtoken  what i found at ghinis commatoken as typical in the us commatoken was pale commatoken without a significantly crusty exterior commatoken and a uniform interior without the characteristic air pockets periodtoken theres really a big difference periodtoken","6616":"a completely ordinary breakfast and an outrageously long wait commatoken thats what you get at the famous pp periodtoken  a good breakfast commatoken tasty and well prepared periodtoken but not special by any means periodtoken what you end up waiting an hour for

were 100 average periodtoken been eating flapjacks for over 50 years commatoken and these are pretty ordinary periodtoken  servers were very friendly commatoken and the atmosphere is fun periodtoken a good family place if your family doesnt mind standing in the street for an hour waiting to be seated periodtoken","6618":"i went for dinner last night with family periodtoken we were seated promptly but it took over 5 minutes for our waitress to say hi and take our drink order periodtoken she always seemed in a hurry to talk to us periodtoken the place seemed understaffed periodtoken i ordered the filet mignon periodtoken it was cooked perfectly medium was actually pink periodtoken the sides were unassuming periodtoken a side of broccoli that i didnt think was seasoned in any way periodtoken and some crispy overcooked potato wedges slightly spicy periodtoken presentation was poor and it looked like any amateur could have done that periodtoken i give it the three stars based on

there bcoz i had a gift card periodtoken they smoke at the bar only but it smells even at nonsmoking areas periodtoken the food was both good and bad periodtoken good the bbq ribs commatoken bbq

tourist site than a place to go for value and good food periodtoken  dont get me wrong as the shell fish is good and fresh but very expensive and terrible atmosphere periodtoken","6647":"this place is a bit overrated periodtoken while the service was great commatoken i think you can find better sushi almost anywhere you go periodtoken i didnt dislike my yellowtail canopy roll periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut i also wasnt impressed by it periodtoken the yellowtail canopy was finely chopped rather than the normal whole pieces of fish commatoken which i worried was hiding bad quality fish periodtoken i ended up removing it and basically just eating a spicy salmon roll periodtoken we also had the sashimi sampler meh and the pork dumplings which were actually very good periodtoken   i probably wouldnt come back if not for our very attentive waiter periodtoken","6648":"i must be missing something on this one periodtoken  the food was okay periodtoken  the

great periodtoken a little to peppery for my friend periodtoken my fiance had a homemade blueberry infused vodka commatoken which she enjoyed periodtoken  the only issue have with pub and kitchen is the price periodtoken  the portions are small commatoken and the price is large periodtoken  so be warned commatoken this is a rittenhouse restaurant with rittenhouse prices periodtoken  dont let the pub in the name fool you commatoken its not a place for a quick commatoken inexpensive bite to eat periodtoken  also commatoken i think if your special is going to be several dollars more then your highest menu item commatoken you might want to mention it periodtoken  blueberry vodka  commatoken which was suggested was 16 a pop commatoken which seemed a bit high too periodtoken  overall nice

was fries that came with house made ketchup which i loved periodtoken you can taste some chunks from the tomatoes periodtoken i ordered a mango ipa which was super smooth compared to regular ipas

periodtoken  there was something for everyone from your weird vegan cousin to your mom who thinks applebees is the epitome of fine dining periodtoken  everyone is going to find something they liked periodtoken  i had a delicious sandwhich with some hearty steak fries and my better half enjoyed buffalo chili periodtoken  one thing i did not enjoy was paying a huge markup for taste of philly pretzels with a side of some notsoyummy pimento cheese dip periodtoken  ill pass on that next time commatoken and wouldnt recommend this app periodtoken  all in all it was a nice place to have a late lunch and enjoy some brews periodtoken  the seating in the bar area isnt very comfy no backs on the chairs commatoken just stools so dont sit there if youre planning to stay a while periodtoken   also commatoken make sure you ask for your check well before you need to leave periodtoken  it honestly took over 15 minutes from the time we told the server we were ready to leave to get our check and

this post periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but i just dont get the hype periodtoken i have tried their frozen custard on several occasions commatoken and i dont think that they are that great

periodtoken we started with the fried calamari and it was by far the best in media periodtoken very fresh with a light breading commatoken so you could actually taste the squid periodtoken the marinara sauce accompanying it was good as well periodtoken my wife choose the braciole commatoken which is a special they have every sunday periodtoken this was her first time having the dish commatoken and it may be her last periodtoken the meat was a little tough commatoken and the stuffing had a somewhat overpowering taste of spices commatoken primarily rosemary commatoken that threw the flavor off periodtoken i personally liked it commatoken and ended up eating most of it as she ate my chicken parm periodtoken my dish was excellent periodtoken the chicken was tender and moist commatoken with a very flavorful breading periodtoken i had a side of gnocchi with it and they were delicious periodtoken they were cooked just right commatoken and were not too dense periodtoken all in all a great dining experience periodtoken it seems every time we go for italian in media we end up at fellinis commatoken but we will definitely be back to spasso","6793":"this place is a fun spot off the main broadripple strip periodtoken  it tends to be a mid30s crowd which is a needed break from the 21 crowd of broadripple periodtoken  this place feels like it belongs on mass ave commatoken

commatoken waffle fries or slaw and salads periodtoken  i find their menu a little bit lacking and i find the chicken to be rather bland periodtoken  sometimes the service is a little spotty but not

periodtokenpeople who have never worked in the food industry periodtoken    in the end commatoken the wait was long but not bause of a long menu or people not working periodtoken periodtoken

the slush coolers boba tea periodtoken not as good as other places periodtoken i feel like there should have been more boba and my taro flavor was not very distinct periodtoken the lychee one was good though periodtoken very refreshing and the rainbow jelly was yum unfortunately commatoken i did not get to try the ube or siopao periodtoken we left the ube on the kitchen counter for a few hours while preparing dinner commatoken so i think it was my fault i should have put in the refrigerator periodtoken but when i went to open it and try some commatoken it was kind of watery on top and didnt look appetizing periodtoken my husband who is filipino ate the siopao when he got home from work and said it was just ok periodtoken  interior is nice and bright commatoken modern looking and there seemed to be a good constant stream of customers coming in periodtoken will definitely have to try some of their food specials and hope to update this review and add some more stars

evidence submiited  1a  observation   dont ever try ordering online periodtoken  1b  analysis   why      a  their high tech ordering web interface generates a fax really  a what       b  nobody there ever looks at the fax machine for orders periodtoken ever    c  funnily commatoken they apparently receive some type of automated phone call that they ignore that tells them to look at the fax machine for an incoming web order periodtoken  maybe morse code would work  2a  observation even calling them ahead doesnt insure you of not waiting in line to pickup a phoned in order periodtoken  2b  analysis unreal    a  their carryout area deals with customer oneatatime periodtoken  period periodtoken   b  case in point      1  last sunday i phoned in an order periodtoken  seems simple right      2  they asked when i was arriving periodtoken  lol periodtoken  more to come periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken      3  two 60s something guys beat me to the door commatoken end up in line in front

she returns he asks if they can pour red wine vinegar into it periodtoken  csr disappears commatoken a few minutes later another csr shows up holding a 2 gallon container of red wine vinegar to ensure  this relic really wanted what he asked for periodtoken  they argue a bit and finally agree periodtoken  original csr returns commatoken he asks for 2 orders of beef tongue off the hot bar that requires another timeburning circuit to ensure they have it periodtoken  she finally returns commatoken and he then decides to order a pastrami sandwich and he wants to know his potato chip choices

and im spinning it with fervor periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken           b  different csr finally shows up commatoken asks second old dude for his order periodtoken  he wants 2 deviled eggs but is extremely concerned that liquid will drip out and mix  with the creamed herring he wants periodtoken  they tell him they are in separate carryout containers but hes adamant hes been told that before and that they have showed up together in the past periodtoken he then parades up and down in front of the cold cut case asking for an 8th of a pound of this and that periodtoken   at this point im wondering if these guys tunneled and escaped out of a local old folks home periodtoken  or perhaps a mental institution periodtoken  3a  observation  they have the best meatloaf on the planet and the portion is huge and comes with 2 side dishes periodtoken  their vegetables are few and bland commatoken but their mac n cheese is a winner commatoken has egg in the recipe and a crunchy exterior periodtoken  two can eat for 22 periodtoken  great sunday fare at a good price periodtoken  3b  analysis  i might get better carry out service if i fake a heart attack while in line or are wheeled in on a gurney asking for my last meal periodtoken  they need to handle phone in orders differently as well as their carryout queueing process but also liable is the ancient clientele they attract and thats not liable to change periodtoken  give this place a shot periodtoken  when you have an hour to kill periodtoken","6816":"this is a great place to go if you need some quick food to sober you up

way i can rate this establishment with a tabula rasa commatoken instead of drunk induced admiration","6818":"pretty decent banh mi periodtoken we loved the fresh baked bread commatoken although wouldve liked it spicier and more acidic the slaw was a bit boring periodtoken more pate would have been nice as well periodtoken this is definitely not the place to go for ambiance commatoken its a counter tucked inside a convenience store but the food is better than youd think from the atmosphere periodtoken","6821":"sometimes what i find confusing about yelp is that there is no real effort to separate really old reviews from the new ones periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and in the case of the daily bread commatoken i wonder if thats an important distinction periodtoken many of the reviews about the poor service and dirty tables seem to be from as far back as 2010 periodtoken i just havent found that they back up my experience there so far periodtoken  i generally go for lunch when its the most busy periodtoken and despite that commatoken the orders are taken fast commatoken theyve yet to be messed up and the food is prepared fairly quickly periodtoken they have a decently sized outdoor area commatoken which is great  because honestly i have never wanted to spend much time inside periodtoken ive found that it tends to be kind of cold in there and its often packed to the gills and loud periodtoken but the outdoor area is quite nice periodtoken  that said commatoken ive liked all of the food ive had periodtoken the buffalo chicken melt is ok commatoken but i was really happy with the various vegetarian options and the smoked salmon sandwich periodtoken they have some great delistyle sandwiches too periodtoken theres just a lot of very different options here commatoken the ingredients are fresh and things are just paired together well periodtoken they have a pretty nice soup combo too commatoken which is barely more than the individual sandwiches periodtoken  a friend of mine had some of their frosted cookies too  whoever is decorating them really knows what theyre doing periodtoken i cant speak of the taste though commatoken as ive not tried one periodtoken  they also have four or more unsweetened ice teas at any given point commatoken which is great periodtoken you dont see that much periodtoken","6825":"elmers great periodtoken  cookie dessert commatoken oh my periodtoken  friendly bartenders who are often airing their woes behind the bar periodtoken   burgers were good periodtoken    i would visit again commatoken just not first choice periodtoken","6827":"it seemed like a lucky coincidence that a grilled cheese sandwich craving would hit on the same night the say cheese truck was making an appearance at the south street night market periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the sandwich that i got after my long wait did little more than quiet the craving periodtoken  i was psyched to see that the grown up grilled cheese listed on the menu board featured taleggio commatoken arugula and jalapenopeach jelly periodtoken  sadly commatoken as i reached the truck a staff member erased the taleggio and wrote in a fairly generic substitution of monterey jack in its place periodtoken  the event was packed and we were there on the late side commatoken so i dont fault them too much for running out of the taleggio periodtoken  however commatoken they kept charging the same price for the sandwich  wth  whatever  i had waited that long i was getting my grilled cheese periodtoken  i had high expectations commatoken and what i received was underwhelming periodtoken  there was a meager ratio of ingredients to bread the bread was hard and dry the cheese was not melted the whole way through and it seemed like they salted the outside of the sandwich periodtoken  there were a few bites in the very middle that actually had a reasonable amount of cheese commatoken arugula and jelly that made me realize what the sandwich could have been periodtoken  for a place that calls itself the say cheese truck commatoken my grilled cheese should have been more than just acceptable periodtoken  curiously my husband went with the nongrilled cheese option commatoken a roast beef poboy commatoken and got a really great commatoken substantial sandwich periodtoken  it was 2 more than the grilled cheese commatoken but that 2 got him a lot more food periodtoken  his sandwich added a star to the review all by itself periodtoken  i might give say cheese another try  especially if i encounter them outside of the mob scene of a night market periodtoken  maybe keeping up with the crowd was part of the problem periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6832":"my trip to pub and kitchen was an unplanned lunch after some hanging in rittenhouse square on a perfect fall afternoon periodtoken    outdoor seating was a must periodtoken    i was looking at a menu and it was rather small and read in an unimpressive way periodtoken    the waiter sold me on a burger which was their special on this day commatoken the meat came blended from a high end butcher in nyc periodtoken  supposedly he had never until now let this blend of meat out of the city periodtoken  pub and kitchen had exclusivity to this meat which peaked my interest in what can a high end butcher from nyc do that i havent seen before with a burger periodtoken    the burger came with caramelized onions on a bun periodtoken  the meat lived up to the height of exclusive beef periodtoken  although i dont plan on spending 18 for a burger again anytime soon periodtoken  my tastebuds were more then satisfied periodtoken  i will describe this meal as i would when i describe the eating experience of any of my favorite foods periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken when the burger was gone commatoken i was a little bit sad periodtoken","6833":"this place is alright periodtoken  they dont have many bakery goods and i did try the ube cake to go periodtoken  it looks delicious but taste like a regular cake commatoken i barely tasted the ubeness periodtoken  i got the taho commatoken i guess im used to the clear very soft tapioca balls in the philippines and not the chewy black ones but the main flaw with the taho was the texture of the tofu periodtoken  its like lightly firm tofu when it should be buttery soft commatoken silken tofu periodtoken  where it just breaks apart when you slurp it like soup periodtoken  thats how ive always had it when i was in the philippines of when my mom buys me some in hawaii chinatown periodtoken  the syrup was on point though periodtoken","6835":"district is definitely good commatoken but its more like eating a piece of cake periodtoken personal rule commatoken if the line is past the tap handles commatoken its not worth the wait periodtoken   the cinnamon roll doesnt get a lot of love but its the best thing on their menu periodtoken they torch it right before serving to you periodtoken that and coffee is pretty awesome periodtoken","6837":"it seems unfair to write a review after having been here only once commatoken so ill have to go back for round two sometime soon commatoken but my initial impression is that this place is okay periodtoken it certainly wasnt bad commatoken but it didnt blow me away periodtoken perhaps i need to try something other than a plain croissant commatoken but at the time what i really wanted was something lunchlike commatoken and everything they had as far as i could tell had meat in it periodtoken something vegetarian along the lines of their turkey sandwich andor ham and cheese croissant perhaps a spinach and feta croissant wouldve been awesome periodtoken maybe i needed to ask periodtoken   in any event commatoken its a bustling little place and people obviously love it periodtoken but it seemed that you kind of needed to know what to order commatoken since there wasnt a ton on display and there wasnt a list or anything periodtoken next time ill have to read the yelp reviews and figure out what to ask for periodtoken ","6838":"the service was solid and friendly periodtoken the food was good commatoken but it was a little overpriced periodtoken i got the longhorn burger and ordered it medium rare periodtoken it was very yummy periodtoken also commatoken their large fries is enough to feed two people periodtoken   their milkshake game is a little weak periodtoken oh commatoken and if you want to have a conversation with someone commatoken they play their music a little too loud periodtoken other than those things commatoken its a solid place for groups commatoken and it has a quirky atmosphere periodtoken","6839":"double check your order because they are new and unorganized periodtoken  that said commatoken i like spicy chicken and for fast food commatoken they do it right periodtoken  i recommend the spicy fried chicken vs the chicken strips periodtoken  ill be posting review updates over time because like i said commatoken this place is new periodtoken  glad they moved to the area periodtoken","6846":"unfortunately commatoken the delicious food was marred by the terrible service periodtoken  the waitress we had was perhaps one of the rudest ive encountered in a while periodtoken  it started when my boyfriend and i decided to order the kolsch which happens to be our favorite beer commatoken despite being the cheapest on the menu and in a can periodtoken  the waitress response when we ordered thisum commatoken really  she also asked us 4 times if we wanted a glass with it periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenshe finally brought the beers out with some glasses and asked again commatoken if we needed a glass periodtoken  yes we said again periodtoken  she then attempted to pour the beer into the glass while it fizzed all over and told us she was a bad at pouring beer periodtoken  just give me the glass commatoken ill pour it myself i told her periodtoken  good was her response periodtoken  the food however was delicious periodtoken  both the mussels and the skate were awesome periodtoken  i would have stayed for dessert and more drinks if the waitress hadnt brought us over our check immediately after we finished dinner without asking us if there was anything else wed like periodtoken  ill definitely be back here commatoken but avoid the rude waitress section periodtoken","6847":"i probably will be criticized for saying this commatoken but to me the candy was too sweet periodtoken i know commatoken you are saying dude commatoken candy is supposed to be sweet commatoken it has sugar periodtoken and i reply yes commatoken i know commatoken but candy should not be so sweet that you cannot even swallow periodtoken and then you reply if you dont like it commatoken dont go periodtoken and now we have agreement commatoken i wont periodtoken","6849":"sushi was good rice was a bit undercooked better than their carson location but when we got seated by the host i let them know i was doing the dinner menu for lunch so i can have a full menu and also let the chef know and everything was great periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken until i ordered dinner rolls i felt like i was being watched by the other chefs about the rolls i ordered and they kept going to talk to my chef in spanish not knowing i spoke spanish saying those are dinner only rolls in spanish periodtoken i continued with my lunch but definitely didnt like being watched on what i was eating especially if they were speaking spanish so i wouldnt understand thats not very professional and hopefully they learn from situations like this periodtoken","6850":"ive been back and forth over this since eating here yesterday periodtoken  mrs periodtoken s and i were excited to finally be in the area for dinner commatoken as we are huge fans of baileys chocolate bar commatoken and figured we would love the range just as much periodtoken    however commatoken we were displeased with our visit  for starters commatoken i had been joking about he new trends with bacon flavored deserts commatoken and joked about checking the menu for a bacon shake periodtoken  little did i know there was a bacon shake on their boozy menu periodtoken  i was feeling adventurous so i ordered this mixture of ice cream commatoken caramel commatoken candied bacon and makers mark liquor periodtoken  at 9 it was one of those situations that i generally avoid commatoken because 9 for a drink that i know nothing about is a risk i just dont take periodtoken  and if i ever had any questions of why i dont take these risks commatoken the bacon shake did it for me periodtoken  this shake is tasted in levels periodtoken  first you get the liquor yummy periodtoken  thats your first sip commatoken ice cream and liquor periodtoken  next you get the caramel periodtoken  by the third or fourth drink commatoken i was getting chunks of bacon periodtoken  not so yummy at this point periodtoken for me it wasnt about the bacon alone periodtoken  it was the tremendously sweet caramel commatoken with the salty yet sweet bacon commatoken all mixed into one thing periodtoken  it was too sweet commatoken too much to handle commatoken and at 9 commatoken too much money to go out on a limb for periodtoken    for dinner commatoken i ordered a bison burger forgot to order cheese with fries and honey mustard sauce periodtoken  mrs periodtoken s got a regular burger with fries and cheese sauce periodtoken  my burger was decent commatoken not bad commatoken but not the best periodtoken  mrs periodtoken s was not as excited about her burger commatoken mostly because the ketchup wasnt your every day flavor periodtoken  i tolerated the different style but i honestly just am not a fan periodtoken  as for the fries commatoken they were good periodtoken  the cheese sauce was much better than the honey mustard commatoken mostly because the honey mustard tasted more like spicy mustard periodtoken  maybe a mistake was made commatoken maybe not commatoken hard to say periodtoken  all in all commatoken baileys range was just ok for me and the wife periodtoken  i am torn between 2 and 3 stars as i write this review commatoken for the simple fact that if someone were visiting and asked to go here commatoken i would probably suggest passing on it commatoken at least if i was expected to be a part of the group and point them in a different direction periodtoken  i think the most fair review i can give here is 3 stars commatoken as part of my issue with baileys range has to do with taste commatoken and for me this isnt my style of food periodtoken  service and atmosphere are both ok as well commatoken but really when i think of a 45 star place commatoken it should transcend tastes and be inviting for people who usually do not eat a certain style of meal or cooking periodtoken  baileys does not do this for me periodtoken  its not exceptional to me periodtoken  its just commatoken ok periodtoken  so here goes commatoken 3 stars for baileys range and a new list for my followers periodtoken  just not my cup of tea periodtoken  a fair rating for a place that just isnt my cup of tea commatoken but some might still find value in the experience periodtoken  that seems fair commatoken right","6851":"i tried a corned beef sandwich as i was enticed by a 5 periodtoken00 coupon periodtoken warm on rye commatoken the meat was sliced thin so very tender periodtoken i was impressed with the help yourself pickles which were pretty good commatoken but the sandwich was pretty average periodtoken for a good corned beef on real ny rye commatoken baked in store along with house roasted corned beef and others i ll drive a little further south on dale mabry to carrollwood deli periodtoken the closest thing to a real ny sandwich in tampa periodtokenwith a very varied menu i will be back to try something else commatoken as the pickles were worth the trip commatoken","6852":"disappointing considering how expensive this place is periodtoken  after living close to it for a few years commatoken a friend took me along to meet up with a group there periodtoken  its just your standard casino but overpriced periodtoken  i wanted to play some 21 but couldnt find a table for less than 15 a hand with most tables saying 25 periodtoken  im a little cheaper than that periodtoken  then walking around the casino commatoken i was shocked periodtoken  not much can shock me these days but in 2015 commatoken seeing people indoors smoking just seemed weird periodtoken","6856":"looking for good crayfish periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this not the place periodtoken i was sorely disappointed periodtoken they were small commatoken not spicey commatoken flavorless  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and i had to send them back because they came out cold periodtoken i was not impressed with raw oysters commatoken either periodtoken a real disappointment for new orleans periodtoken on the other hand the brussels sprouts coleslaw was quite tasty periodtoken","6860":"closer to 3 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken  just had this for lunch periodtoken  the place was nice looking and clean periodtoken  the staff was really friendly periodtoken  i paid 15 periodtoken99 for a fire quacker duck burger and some sweet fries periodtoken  the burger itself was a little smaller than i had anticipated periodtoken  it wasnt as flavorful as i thought it was going to be either periodtoken  it wasnt even remotely spicy periodtoken  the duck was cooked very well though and tasted good periodtoken  ive had better sweet fries periodtoken    i think i will try this place again though commatoken i really want to try the duck bacon or brisket on a burger periodtoken","6863":"i have been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally had a chance last week periodtoken do not let the fact that this is a food truck with tables and awning dissuade you from going the food is good periodtoken i had the carne asada tacos and the carne asada caramelo which were good periodtoken my friend had the cabeza tacos which were also good periodtoken it was a little crowded but the food was served quickly periodtoken it is outside commatoken so keep in mind the temperature when you go periodtokenthey also have sonoran hot dogs commatoken but we decided to try them next time periodtoken","6865":"good food periodtoken my son loves the lamb periodtoken owner super friendly and visited our table periodtoken very clean periodtoken lots of seating periodtoken we enjoyed it periodtoken","6868":"i went for lunch during the week wednesday with my friend peter periodtoken i was really excited to try this cypriot food periodtoken he got the spanakopita commatoken and i got ground lamb with pine nuts on flatbread i think it was called lacham azeen periodtoken both came with a few mouthfuls of a side salad periodtoken  the food was tasty  hot commatoken came out quickly commatoken and the portions were perfect for lunch periodtoken  service was decent commatoken the waiter was very practiced and tried to be funny periodtoken i would have preferred he had been better about keeping the water glasses full instead of disappearing outside every few minutes he was commatoken however commatoken very solicitous and offered recommendations periodtoken  the decor is nice commatoken the walls are painted white commatoken the touches of blue and the ambient light give it a very mediterranean feel commatoken which i suppose is what theyre going for","6869":"this place is a bit expensive for fast food and the portions arent too generous commatoken but if youre in a hurry and youre walking home from a night class commatoken this may be your best bet its open most weeknights until 11 p periodtokenm periodtoken  lunch items arent served until 11 a periodtokenm periodtoken  if you go any earlier youre stuck with bagels i believe theyre called squagels by virtue of the fact that theyre squarish and not circular and other items i dont really consider to be real food periodtoken  i tried the jalapeno and cheddar squagel on two occasions  i ordered cream cheese with it and it was fairly tasty to my sleepdeprived commatoken 7 a periodtokenm periodtoken commatoken slightly offgame taste buds periodtoken  the asian chicken salad was acceptable and the piece of bread it came with was fairly good and added value to the meal periodtoken  the chain also offers a 12salad commatoken 12sandwich combo which is a convenient though obvious idea periodtoken i usually get the tuscan pesto chicken since its the least offensive and least messy of the sandwiches ive ordered here the chicken tinga sandwich is a bit messier  the guacamole and stringy chicken bits tend to spill out of the sandwich when you bite into it and i order a salad with it periodtoken  ive never gotten a soup here periodtoken    the coffee is acceptable if not memorable periodtoken  the brownies and cookies dont exactly taste homemade commatoken but if the mood strikes you commatoken theyre available periodtoken    going back to the sandwiches  order them raw not toasted since the toasted bread is crunchy and hard periodtoken  also commatoken the tuscan pesto chicken tastes better without melted cheese periodtoken  the latter ruins an otherwise quasihealthy meal periodtoken  ive never gotten the carrots with a sandwich commatoken but ive opted for the pepperflavored kettle chips periodtoken  raw carrots dont particularly appeal to me periodtoken  for beverages commatoken i do recommend their lemonades mojito lemonade or raspberry lemonade albeit theyre full of empty calories periodtoken    service b taste b","6870":"it wasnt great but it wasnt bad periodtoken the food was good periodtoken i had a ham and cheese griller so you really cant mess that up periodtoken my mom had a club and my sister had a wrap periodtoken the wrap had honey mustard even though my sister said no honey mustard periodtoken but i dont know if i can blame the cook or the waitress periodtoken   our waitress wasnt the greatest periodtoken she was a little slow and when we asked her what the soup of the day was she forgot to come back and tell us periodtoken when she did remember she couldnt remember what the soup was periodtoken today it was cream or something commatoken maybe crab or maybe corn and something vegetable periodtoken im not kidding that is what she said periodtoken now as i am allergic to seafood they are very different soups   the prices there are pretty reasonable periodtoken for the three of us it was about 30 bucks periodtoken i will admit i have been there for breakfast and that was much better periodtoken","6871":"the more and more i go to gastropubs commatoken the less and less impressed i am by them periodtoken i dont know if the schtick is just getting old commatoken or if people are doing a worse job commatoken or what commatoken but cmon people commatoken entertain me  pub and kitchen strikes me as a fairly run of the mill entry into the gastropub arena periodtoken very nice interior rehab job check periodtoken pretty awesome selection of beers check periodtoken couple fancy commatoken gourmetish items on the menu check periodtoken yawn periodtoken the thing missing was something to separate this place from the crowd periodtoken why would i go here instead of any other place just like this jonny brendas has whiskey donuts periodtoken the tap room has tacos of the day periodtoken the royal has one of the better burgers around commatoken not to mention innovative uses of pork that surprise me every time mmmm commatoken pulledpork nachos with beer cheese sauce  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i digress periodtoken this place had  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken 18 dollar fish and chips periodtoken 18 bucks seriously for fish and chips maybe you shouldve saved some money on the fancy interior so you could serve some food for a reasonable price periodtoken listen up pub and kitchen and you too commatoken devils den if i wanna spend 40 dollars on dinner commatoken im not going to a gastropub commatoken not when there are better dinners to be had for 40 pick your byob or much cheaper gastropubs with the same food i dont get the 20 dollar entree movement in these places commatoken it really makes no sense periodtoken  one other irk our waiter was nice commatoken but he had to have come to our table like 45 times during the course of the meal periodtoken body language my friend commatoken it will tell you all you need to know commatoken like when we are done with our menus see putting down menu commatoken when i need another drink see drink close to or completely empty periodtoken this aint rocket science homey periodtoken update as i read through all the other reviews commatoken bad service is a recurring theme periodtoken  if you live near pub and kitchen commatoken or are in the area commatoken hit it up commatoken itll be a fine dinner periodtoken but i dont think its worth traveling very far at all to go to this place periodtoken","6873":"not bad commatoken but not out of this world periodtoken city limits is a popular breakfast spot in bellevue with a roomy interior commatoken outdoor seating commatoken a large array of coffees commatoken and friendly employees periodtoken  the extensive menu offers a number of options and specializes in the banini various paninistyle sandwiches framed by a bagel periodtoken on paper commatoken the huevos rancheros banini seems like the winner commatoken with pepper jack cheese commatoken egg and bacon commatoken and my favorite condiment on the planet commatoken jalape\u00f1o cream cheese commatoken all between an everything bagel periodtoken but there wasnt that spicy kick i had hoped for commatoken reasonably flavorful but not the heat i anticipated periodtoken the bagel was blander than most ive eaten commatoken which really surprised me because its hard to mess up an everything bagel periodtoken  the southern banini was better commatoken with egg commatoken bacon commatoken and cheddar cheese commatoken but the most significant difference was the flavorful sausage offsetting the blandness of the sesame seed bagel periodtoken would i eat here again sure commatoken if i were meeting someone for breakfast periodtoken but i wouldnt go two blocks out of my way to eat here periodtoken quite frankly commatoken when im in the bellevue station strip mall commatoken im heading straight for legendary pizza perfect","6878":"solid not going to complain commatoken i mean they are doing it periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken bringing pho to mainstream america well ucsb that is periodtoken  i wish they were here when i attended ucsb but better late than never periodtoken    i had the pho tai and if you are craving pho then this may satisfy your craving periodtoken  however commatoken i prefer my thin slices of meat rare and thin periodtoken  my noodles were a bit limp and i like my bean sprouts crisper

addiciting periodtoken  the 2 young men behind the counter were very sweet and lovely periodtoken  although im more of a salty girl but when it comes to vietnamese coffee commatoken i go all out periodtoken  give me the 2 inches of condensed milk periodtoken   they go light here commatoken maybe just looking out for you periodtoken  yeah a bit pricey for a vietnamese joint but id rather spend 10 bucks on a meal here then spend 7 at a drive thru periodtoken  much better for you and go ahead and titilate your senses periodtoken  you can alwasy douse your pho with siracha or hoisin sauce

periodtoken heed the warning from other patrons periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe location is small and there is a considerable waiting list for a table periodtoken since we were interested in the food and not so much how we eat it commatoken we ordered from the side window and ate our food on the outside patio tables periodtoken i ordered the cioppinno served in a bread bowl periodtoken  the flavor was delicious and there was plenty of seafood commatoken including a rock crab claw commatoken blue crab legs commatoken shrimp commatoken scallops commatoken and mussels periodtoken my only problem with this dish was the awkward way in which i had to eat it without a shell cracker for the rock crab and how messy the soup was served in the bread bowl periodtoken 8 napkins were not enough to keep my hands clean as i ate periodtoken im assuming that if i tried the food served in the restaurant commatoken it might have been a little smoother periodtoken my husband ordered the crab

place we opted to eat seafood in santa barbara commatoken and it was not too shabby periodtoken we walked to the restaurant from our hotel commatoken which was a bonus periodtoken taking in the atmosphere of the wharf on a chilly night certainly got us into the santa barbara mood periodtoken even once we arrived commatoken the small bar style dining and aroma of the days catch inside the place was in line with the image one conjures up when thinking of fresh seafood periodtoken  after a very brief wait commatoken we got a seat looking directly at the kitchen commatoken and let me tell you commatoken the staff have this operation down to a science periodtoken they are moving people in and out of the restaurant at record speed commatoken all without sacrificing service periodtoken our waiter was friendly and helpful commatoken and we never once felt rushed periodtoken in fact commatoken this was a highlight for us periodtoken even when selecting our beverages commatoken he let us sample beer and made recommendations on wine periodtoken   we ordered all of our food at once commatoken as wed had a chance to peruse the menu and take a few tips from yelp periodtoken we ordered a glutenfest including a cup of clam chowder commatoken a half dozen oysters commatoken some coconut shrimp and the shrimp and scallop linguine periodtoken  the clam chowder arrived first commatoken and it was a bit bland periodtoken i really wanted to like it since the weather was ideal and they add bacon in every batch  commatoken but it was lacking something periodtoken adding the oyster crackers helped commatoken but i would recommend skipping this periodtoken if you are in a soup mood commatoken maybe try the soup of the day periodtoken they had a bisque commatoken and that might have been a better option periodtoken   the oysters arrived next commatoken and that was the biggest letdown for me periodtoken i am an oyster junkie  ive been known to eat four dozen in one sitting periodtoken im also an oyster purist commatoken meaning i add only a tiny bit of lemon before eating them so they maintain their sea flavor periodtoken the presentation was sloppy  just ice on a plate commatoken which was melting and wet our eating area commatoken a measly slice of lemon and lime commatoken cocktail sauce and a little horseradish periodtoken the oysters themselves just werent that good commatoken and for the first time in my life commatoken i left two on the plate when it went back periodtoken  the coconut shrimp and linguine arrived together commatoken and they were both quite good periodtoken you know how sometimes when you get coconut shrimp commatoken they seem to be lacking coconut these babies were loaded with it and were large in size to boot periodtoken i think i bit into the tail on every shrimp i ate on account of the batter being so delicious periodtoken the onion ring garnish was also amazing periodtoken maybe its just the fact that i dont eat gluten often commatoken but the batter on everything was outstanding periodtoken  the linguine was pretty good as the seafood was tender and the noodles were just past al dente periodtoken the sauce was a little too white winey for me commatoken but my boyfriend loved it periodtoken maybe it felt like too much because i was already drinking a glass of sauvignon blanc periodtoken  all in all commatoken i think this was a three and a half star dining experience periodtoken admittedly commatoken the biggest disappointment was likely my own elevated expectations periodtoken yelp reviews caused me to believe that the food would be spectacular commatoken and id say it was just good periodtoken seeing the aquariums of crab was also sad as they were overcrowded and all trying to escape periodtoken maybe ive just seen finding nemo too many times commatoken but i couldnt watch them periodtoken watching the chef commatoken however commatoken was fun commatoken and the shellfish coming off the grill looked

roll commatoken and cheddar really came together nicely periodtoken i inhaled it periodtoken i also accompanied this small wonder with the truffle fries periodtoken they were delicious commatoken the truffle taste came through in every bite commatoken but they were incredibly salty periodtoken for the rest of the day i staggered back and forth to the water cooler to quench my thirst commatoken like a man walking through a desert that also has a water cooler in it periodtoken this place has some potential and id definitely try it again commatoken but im not sure if id eat here any more than once a month periodtoken for those looking for a miniature version of the fabled rouge burger commatoken there is one distinction the rouge burger is topped with divine gruy\u00e8re cheese while the 500 burger is only available with swiss commatoken provolone commatoken cheddar commatoken or american periodtoken other than that commatoken the burger is pretty much the same commatoken except about 14 the size or less periodtoken brioche buns are key","6895":"this review is based on the deli side only periodtoken the pastry side is delicious 5 stars periodtoken  great pies and donuts periodtoken ok back to my review periodtoken   i got a hoagie today periodtoken yes eat gud makes hoagies now periodtoken  the price was reasonable periodtoken  4 periodtoken99 for a 6 inch hoagie with a small side salad periodtoken i got potato salad which was tasty periodtoken the roll was stale which wasnt like eat gud since their bread is usually fresh and they were sold out of french baguettes periodtoken i got londonport roast beef which was tasty but was lacking in quantity periodtoken  they weigh out their meat to only 3oz of meat for 1 meat per sandwich periodtoken  they use boars head meat which i prefer but for some reason  the majority of sandwich shops in hamilton dont carry periodtoken so all in all good tasting meat but not enough of it periodtoken  hopefully on my next visit they get rid of their weighing out policy and provide more meat periodtoken also i hope they have a fresher roll selection for hoagies periodtoken","6898":"tonight we went to the shlafly brewery for supper periodtoken i had a salad called green and grain with ranch grilled chicken periodtoken  i am very pleased with my choice a full plate nicely arranged and the quianno was a great addition to the salad periodtoken","6901":"enjoyed the service periodtoken periodtoken periodtokencute and helpful wait staff periodtoken the food was very good periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenordered mostly apps periodtoken glad we dropped in periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwould come back periodtoken","6902":"had dinner here on a gorgeous night  we had to take advantage of the weather and sit outside periodtoken we were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a table commatoken so we had a few drinks at the bar periodtoken 7 cocktails this new yorker needs to travel  who am i kidding  anywhere to get her affordable liquor fix i ordered the mint julep but really didnt like it periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the bartender swapped it out for the strawberry sangria for free spreading the love in philly  the sangria was much tastier periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i had been craving mussels all day and so was thrilled to see them on the dinner menu periodtoken big mistake  these mussels were in a hefeweizen broth periodtoken the flavor was awful periodtoken the color of the broth was murky and make me frightened to dip my bread periodtoken and once i mustered up the courage commatoken it didnt even taste good soooo very disappointing meal periodtoken my friends were perfectly satisfied with their own selections commatoken so im just going to chalk it up to poor selection on my part periodtoken but if the word pub is in the name of your restaurant commatoken shouldnt you do a good job with mussels three stars for the cheap and tasty alcohol ","6903":"this is supposed to be the innout of the midwest commatoken meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i think i was just expecting a lot more since innout is what i had always heard as the comparison commatoken but that doesnt even come close to true periodtoken as a bicoastal resident of both cali and indy i am privileged to eaten at both places many times for many years commatoken and five guys commatoken although a step up from mcdonaldswendys commatoken is nothing more than just an average fast food burger joint periodtoken the fries are not anything worth writing home about commatoken and the peanuts are kinda weird periodtoken i have been to this location many times and i have always had great service thats what the 3 stars are for commatoken and the food is fine commatoken it just aint no innout periodtoken but this is a good location for sure commatoken they are clean commatoken friendly commatoken and fast","6904":"great service and friendly staff periodtoken highly mediocre food periodtoken calamari undercooked and doughy periodtoken spaghetti bolognese tasted like chef boyardi world there periodtoken needs improvement","6908":"came here to try a frozen coffee since it was in the area we were shopping periodtoken i got the mocha frappe which was okay periodtoken i wouldnt drive distances for it periodtoken the atmosphere is decent for a cafe commatoken but based on how big it is commatoken youd think it would be busier periodtoken i will say that my dad usually picks up birthday cakes from here and they are pretty delicious commatoken especially the birthday cake with the fruit periodtoken overall commatoken dont really expect great coffee commatoken but definitely try some desserts periodtoken","6909":"inexpensive lunch combos periodtoken fresh and tasty periodtoken nothing to write home about though periodtoken","6910":"drinks we had were great commatoken our server was outgoing and friendly periodtoken this would be a great place to stop by for some drinks or desert commatoken but the food was seriously disappointing periodtoken i ordered the friday special commatoken enchiladas la bamba commatoken which turned out to be just a really plain taco casserole on top of tortilla chips periodtoken really nothing special about it at all periodtoken my date ordered the chicken pesto commatoken which turned out to be the type of frozen chicken with the grill lines painted on it periodtoken as i said commatoken the food was a major disappointment and i would not recommend it commatoken but the drinks were good and the atmosphere was nice and appealing periodtoken","6919":"i have been using castrillos for years and i think they have gotten under new ownership in the last 6 months and i dont like it as much periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken crap commatoken i mean i really want to commatoken i do periodtoken i even tried again the other day and i was just underwhelmed periodtoken   i dont think the sauce is all that good any more and i have gotten some soggy dough a few times periodtoken this last time the pepperoni so so over cooked it had hardened and started to shrivel periodtoken i didnt even finish one piece periodtoken   so commatoken whomever bought this business needs to call the old owners and find out their secrets and go back to the way it was because that was working for me and this is just not even close periodtoken","6921":"i stopped by greko to pick up food on the way home commatoken so this was a to go order periodtoken the counter service is great commatoken everyone is really personable commatoken which is a definite plus periodtoken i noticed that the owner was even kind enough to assist someone possibly homeless by giving them something to eat periodtoken this added the third star periodtoken   my experience commatoken i ordered the greek salad and added the lamb periodtoken  the salad ingredients were fresh commatoken if sparse periodtoken i was able to count the number of cucumbers and tomatoes and kalamata olives commatoken the addition of the fried chickpeas was nice periodtoken my salad was completely missing feta cheese  i did call back and let them know that my salad was missing feta periodtoken i only received an apology periodtoken  that was by far my biggest disappointment periodtoken my total with tax was over 15 periodtoken there was not enough food to justify this commatoken and while the quality was great commatoken i was definitely still hungry periodtoken   i also didnt love that they chop the lamb up before putting it on the salad periodtoken i am probably one of those rare individuals that would rather they leave it sliced periodtoken    i really want them to do well commatoken but fear that these serving sizes and price might prevent some from trying it out periodtoken","6923":"made a stop here one afternoon for an addition to my hard rock tshirt collection periodtoken the tshirts here are a little different in that the logo in the middle of the shirt is purple instead of yellow and it fades pretty badly after you wash it once periodtoken  i went to the food court and got something to eat and it was basically like you average mall food court periodtoken i looked around some and i thought that the casino itself was pretty nice but probably not as good as vegas periodtoken if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke commatoken i would stay out of here commatoken this place reeks of it but thats to be expected in a casino in my opinion and it didnt bother me that much periodtoken  i agree with some of the other reviewers in that it did look like a good place to party commatoken if i would have discovered this place ten years ago commatoken i could have gotten into a lot of trouble here commatoken lol periodtoken","6927":"people smoking in the bar periodtoken bar games jumbo jenga commatoken shuffle board commatoken corn hole periodtoken give it a try periodtoken  i dont know if it is a st periodtoken louis thing commatoken but i havent seen the words douche bag and douchey in so many reviews before periodtoken maybe it fits commatoken i thought it was ok periodtoken","6934":"i love the food and drinks here commatoken ive never had anything i didnt like periodtoken my favorite is the grilled cheese commatoken mixing apples and cheese is my favorite commatoken so this sandwich is a hit for me periodtoken the decor is awesome as well commatoken very unique and and fun periodtoken what i find really disappointing is the service periodtoken the past few times ive been in ive had the same male server who has been less than stellar periodtoken we wait maybe 10 minutes to give an order commatoken waited 30 minutes for our first drinks commatoken and then another 20 for the check periodtoken i would have loved to order a couple more drinks and maybe some desert commatoken but waiting on the server 30 minutes per drink is something i dont have time for periodtoken the other staff seemed to be working really hard and even helped us out a little when our server was no where to be found commatoken i wish i would have had one of them instead periodtoken","6943":"stopped in and had a nice gyro periodtoken the help was friendly commatoken you can taste the espresso in the iced mocha and they make their bakalava periodtoken i took some to go and havent had it yet periodtoken  lots of egg combinations for breakfast were offered periodtoken","6945":"when freddys opened i couldnt get enough periodtoken i think i went once or twice a week the months after it opened periodtoken they serve match stick fries commatoken chicken burgers commatoken melts commatoken hamburgers and hotdogs periodtoken my favorite is the freddys frozen custard i cant get enough commatoken its addicting for me periodtoken i see the monthly special flavors and just love every one periodtoken i especially love when they blend in the toppings to make a concrete commatoken and this i will go through their drive through to get periodtoken the are thick and as good as it gets periodtoken i would give this place a 5 out of 5 in the dessert category periodtoken    however commatoken the food is ok periodtoken its fresh and hot periodtoken  i just dont care for their style of burger nor their match stick fries so the thought of eating of meal there commatoken would for me commatoken just be a means to an end to get dessert periodtoken i will profess im a picky fry person periodtoken  a huge plus at freddys are its staff periodtoken they are always friendly and polite commatoken the space is open and good for people with mobility issues periodtoken also the location is clean and there is plenty of parking periodtoken so its got a lot going for it periodtoken","6950":"a little overhyped but solid overall periodtoken the wait can be a bit much being that its located on the pier with tons of tourists periodtoken enjoyed the food commatoken nothing really bowled me over commatoken but i enjoyed myself periodtoken dont think ill be back but thats mostly because of the long wait periodtoken the staff was terrific periodtoken","6952":"the food was very tasty but spicy periodtoken  im not really a fan of indian food so im not a great judge of this stuff but i think it was pretty good periodtoken  very well done commatoken but unbearably spicy periodtoken  the only items not spicy were the white rice commatoken pita bread commatoken and vegetable pakora periodtoken  aside from the food commatoken the people were very friendly periodtoken  and the lunch buffet was 8 periodtoken99 which was fair periodtoken  my main complaint is the state of the restaurant periodtoken the interior is outdated and dark and the exterior is shady commatoken but the atmosphere is comfortable periodtoken","6953":"i would say this is not the best bbq in tampa but its not bad if your in the mood and in the area periodtoken there is no place to sit and eat so its pretty much drive up commatoken walk up and order your food periodtoken this is pretty much two trailerout buildings set up roadside periodtoken as for the food ribs are fall off the bone but not really that much flavor periodtoken no dry or wet rub placed prior to smoking commatoken and heck anything can become fall off the bone if you leave it on the smoker along enough periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni dont mean this to come off that harsh but i am trying to be honest periodtoken i prefer my bbq to have some sort of bark on the exterior with a noticeable smoke ring this bbq is absent of the bark and only a light smoke ring periodtoken as for the sides they are just a ok in my opinion periodtoken periodtoken the beans say out inside individual packaged containers so there room temp commatoken dry commatoken and thick periodtoken the macaroni salad was the same lukewarm and bland periodtoken i guess in a pinch it fits the bill but if your in the mood for some finger licking bbq you might want to look elsewhere periodtoken periodtoken","6955":"service was a little lacking commatoken but food was definitely 5 stars we came in at what appeared to be shift change commatoken so the waitress that seated us seemed annoyed periodtoken the homemade sourdough and jelly was amazing periodtoken i ordered the california dreamin and absolutely enjoyed it periodtoken would definitely go back for food quality commatoken but the 3 star rating is for the service quality periodtoken","6962":"burgers are a tinge overcooked commatoken the only available toppings are bacon and cheese carson location and others offer fried eggs periodtoken fries were soggy but the homestyle vanilla coke was the redeemer","6964":"its ok periodtoken pretty good pizza commatoken friendly service commatoken great decor commatoken and convenient location periodtoken   the pizza  i was here for late lunch and decided to order the lunch special  a slice of cheese pizza commatoken salad commatoken and soft drink for 8 periodtoken00 periodtoken you can add whatever toppings you desire for 0 periodtoken50 each periodtoken not a bad deal periodtoken i ordered the salad with raspberrywalnut vinaigrette dressing and a cheese pizza with italian sausage periodtoken the salad was brought out with my drink periodtoken it was a generous serving of lettuce commatoken tomato commatoken red onions and fabulous crunchy croutons periodtoken the salad was good commatoken but nothing outstanding periodtoken it was also served heaped on a small plate periodtoken keeping it on the plate while i ate was a bit difficult periodtoken   the pizza came out in about 20 minutes periodtoken it was a huge slice of thick crust type pizza which is not my favorite periodtoken it was also so large and the the crust so thick commatoken i had to eat it with a knife and fork shudder periodtoken the overall taste was bland and with the thick crust it all was a bit dry periodtoken the sausage was crumbled and uninspiring periodtoken   the interior is funky and cute and clean periodtoken the blue walls and touches of art and blousy curtains give it a pleasant friendly hippy feeling that is welcoming and casual periodtoken   i think i would give it another try and order a personal size pizza with one of the special combinations periodtoken they also have a nice selection of beers in addition to soft drinks periodtoken","6967":"it must be good because theres always a line periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i would say if you can walk right in and eat commatoken its worth the wait periodtoken otherwise commatoken i wouldnt stand in line periodtoken  im an regular pancake sort of guy periodtoken no fancy pancakes periodtoken just pancakes commatoken eggs and ham periodtoken  mine breakfast was good but not over the top periodtoken  my wife had the cooks medley periodtoken  again commatoken it was good but nothing super special periodtoken  we were told by a nice couple that the sweet potato pancakes were the deal periodtoken  maybe next time periodtoken  service was good commatoken they have water  coffee while youre waiting periodtoken  we were told the lines were shortest before 9 and after noon periodtoken  i would say if your visiting commatoken have time on your hands and want to do something nashville commatoken come on periodtoken  good people watching and chatting with the neighbors in line periodtoken if you want something more unique commatoken theres probably more unique finds in nashville periodtoken  you can get larger groups in here if you want periodtoken  also commatoken there were lots of kids periodtoken  really built for groups of 4 or 6 periodtoken","6969":"i cant give this place 4 stars because the burrito i ordered commatoken steak was just ok periodtoken  for 7 it was bland and light on the meat periodtoken  however commatoken the place is called indy tacos for a reason other then a hopeless lack of creativity periodtoken  the taco i ordered was terrific periodtoken  the mole which is a flavor that can easily be mutilated taco was amazing periodtoken  finally an authentic taco in indiana periodtoken  it was packed with fresh commatoken tasty ingredients and the sauce was fantastic periodtoken  i will go back and try the other tacos commatoken if i can get past the mole commatoken skipping the steak of course periodtoken  2 to 3 tacos would make for a filling lunch commatoken which is cheap in my book periodtoken","6976":"this is a tough review for me periodtoken  i love donuts periodtoken growing up commatoken a lit hot now sign followed by a warm krispy kreme donut was a favorite scenario of mine periodtoken rightfully so yeast donuts have always been my favorite until i grew older and couldnt deal with the excessive sweetness and converted to an occasional cake donut    i heard all the rave about this place when i moved here and i just knew i found the perfect way to satisfy my donut crave without being too sweet like krispy kreme or too dense like dunkin periodtoken i think hearing everyone else talk so much about it clouded my judgement and i just thought they were the best hands down periodtoken after that excitement wore off i returned and i was able to think on my own how i felt about them periodtoken   as for the donut itself i could go without periodtoken its dry and not usually what i think of as a real donut in my opinion when it comes to taste periodtoken not yeasty but also not cakey periodtoken its definitely its own breed periodtoken   what keeps me coming back however commatoken are the toppings periodtoken these guys are always making up the best flavor combos using just about anything u can think of as inspiration periodtoken they post the donut lineup of the day on their instagram every morning so you know which they are offering on that day periodtoken between the varieties of the flavors along with their levels of sweetness everyone is sure to find something they like periodtoken   they have an entire menu outside of the donuts though periodtoken usually 3 slider options for the day periodtoken your usual coffee drinks and teas plus soda and juiced veggies periodtoken   they do have wifi and indoor as well as 2 outdoor seating locations periodtoken i love the open kitchen and hearing the buzz of all the customers in and out periodtoken definitely a place to at least try once periodtoken","6980":"a friend and i found this little cafe on our way back to the hotel one afternoon and decided that we should keep it in mind to try out before we left periodtoken  turns out we went there the very next morning for a well needed hangover cure before a lengthy day of sight seeing and an even longer night of roaming around bourbon street periodtoken    the menu is listed on huge black chalkboards above the counter where you order commatoken although if you dont feel like craning your neck backwards and squinting from your spot in line commatoken you can find a paper copy close to the entrance or left on tables periodtoken  its your typical cafe menu bagels commatoken omlettes commatoken breakfast platters commatoken etc periodtoken with a slight french twist to some dishes i periodtokene periodtoken you can order a fresh croissant instead of toast periodtoken  the prices arent too bad eitherabout 6 or 7 bucks for a breakfast platter commatoken 2 or 3 bucks for a special coffee periodtoken  the line can get pretty long commatoken but i dont see it as the kind of place with a line out the door as there are tons of other similar cafes splattered all over the french quarter periodtoken  you have to order at the counter commatoken take your number card and try to find a place to sit periodtoken  the turnover in this place is pretty quick commatoken so it shouldnt be too hard to find a seat and you can always move tables if necessary periodtoken  if you dont want to eat there commatoken i think you can also get the food to go periodtoken  since the place is small commatoken its easy to feel very crowded in there when the line is long commatoken so i recommend sitting by the door if you can snag a spot commatoken makes it feel a little more open periodtoken  i got a breakfast platter with eggs commatoken hash browns commatoken bacon and a croissant instead of toast periodtoken  the eggs were fine i dont like yolk commatoken so i only order the whites and its very hard to mess those up  the hash browns were great commatoken shredded and greasy maybe a little too greasy with random bites of crispy potatoes mixed in the croissant was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was supposed to be warm and buttered but it was more like a crispy flaky mess with a spot of butter  sadly the bacon was greasy and limp instead of nice and crispy like i expected i ate it anyway periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou can never turn down bacon periodtoken  my friends ordered similar platters which came out looking a lot like mine periodtoken    overall commatoken the food was a little greasy for my taste commatoken but it did the job periodtoken","6981":"thats a shame  this place is full of junkies customers  the staff and the service is fast  its just too much like homeless or you can tell the addict people all coming here and soliciting","6982":"so i normally love this place but today commatoken not so much periodtoken ordered 2 bowls the same except one fish change and mine was missing ingredients and looked like a darn mess as compared to the other bowl periodtoken consistency is key","6988":"this is at least my 6th or 7th trip to danny boy beer works and nothing changes periodtoken i love the craft beers and the place itself periodtoken they have 2 great patios  one sunny and one in the shade periodtoken but my problem is the service periodtoken we went on sunday and after sitting at a table for about 5 minutes i went up and ordered beers at the bar from the bartender periodtoken  i grabbed menus and after sitting with our beers for another 5 to 10 minutes i was able to flag down a waiter periodtoken we ordered an appetizer periodtoken the appetizer was brought and i was told that he would return in a minute with plates and napkins periodtoken never happened periodtoken we finished the appetizer and ordered another beer from the waiter periodtoken we were never asked if we wanted more food or water although i saw other tables with glasses and pitchers of water on them periodtoken in fact commatoken he walked by us with a pitcher of water twice periodtoken to get my check commatoken i had to go back to the bar and ask the bartender to ring it out periodtoken  if this were the first time commatoken maybe i would be kinder periodtoken unfortunately it is not periodtoken often you cant tell if there is wait staff or not periodtoken so commatoken go for the great beer try a take me to church but be prepared to get it yourself periodtoken","6990":"the last time i visited this place was very disappointing periodtoken the disappointment came from unfriendly service and the desserts periodtoken  my friend ordered a seasonal peppermint hot chocolate and when it arrived it didnt taste of peppermint periodtoken when she mentioned this to our server commatoken the server seemed annoyed periodtoken when she brought it back commatoken they hadnt topped it with more whipped cream periodtoken this made the product look sloppy and like the kitchen didnt care  like they just put a few drop of syrup in it and sent the mess back out periodtoken also commatoken basically any time we said anything to our server commatoken she looked annoyed periodtoken no fun periodtoken  while their carrot cake and root beer float are pretty decent commatoken the other desserts are pretty disappointing periodtoken ive also tried their chocolate tart periodtoken it was good commatoken but the serving was so small and while theyre known for their bread pudding commatoken it is no where near my favorite in town periodtoken   this place is nice for lunch when you just want a simple soup and salad periodtoken and hopefully your server is in a better mood than mine was periodtoken","6998":"thought a little over priced periodtoken they had issues day we went periodtoken couldnt get in beechwood aging section periodtoken giving bud light hat when ive been drinking budweiser for 40yrs periodtoken for 35 should been given choice between bud and bud light hat periodtoken gave bud light hat away periodtoken","6999":"our visit to baileys range was a bit of a disappointment periodtoken  it was our first dine in experience here commatoken we were looking forward to it periodtoken  we had got an ice cream to go once previously and wanted to try dining in after we saw the cool atmosphere periodtoken  so on a luch break we tried a dine in periodtoken  we got sat right away even though they were slightly busy periodtoken  we got our order in right away periodtoken  we ordered the burgers well done which we regretted due to them being overdone and very dry periodtoken  however the flavor combinations of both burgers were quite tasty periodtoken  our server was really slow and not because she was busy with other tables periodtoken  she just took extremely long to get anything we needed like more napkins commatoken drink refills and our food periodtoken  she quickly picked up the bill to cash out our payment though periodtoken  she also was a bit rude in her service to us periodtoken  it was lunch time we were short on time so it felt too long of a visit commatoken over one hour to get some burgers and fries periodtoken  we got our ice cream to go again as to get done on time periodtoken  on the plus side our servie at the ice cream station was very quick and super friendly periodtoken  we have agreed to try to dine in one more time before we give up on this place so hopefully it will be better periodtoken  peace","7003":"the service is great and the staff are very friendly commatoken but i was very disappointed in the serving sizes of the adult beverages periodtoken most beer bars restrict serving sizes around 11 abv commatoken but anything over 8 gets served in an 8oz glass at the price of a pint periodtoken their bloody marys are  phenomenal periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken all 6oz of them periodtoken finally commatoken i understand that people love their pets commatoken but restaurants are not the place for your little yorkie in a basket that you continue to feed under the table periodtoken if you disagree commatoken this is the place for you periodtoken a service animal is one thing and completely acceptable commatoken but be considerate of other patrons this isnt petsmart periodtoken","7004":"typical diner fare periodtoken layout similar to most of the philly and south jersey diners periodtoken menu options were nice periodtoken  went with the roast port sandwich with broccoli rabe periodtoken they brought it without long hots which just wasnt going to work for me periodtoken luckily they were able to get some for me and i did really enjoy the sandwich periodtoken","7005":"burger up is our favorite restaurant periodtoken my wife and i eat there probably more than any other restaurant periodtoken weve always been to the 12 south location commatoken but after seeing a movie at the carmike thoroughbred commatoken we decided to try the cool springs burger up periodtoken   to preface commatoken i want to say the service commatoken decor commatoken and even the food commatoken was all good periodtoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit wasnt the same as the 12 south burger up periodtoken the aioli had a bit of a corn syrup taste commatoken and the woodstock my wife and i shared had a tinge of a sloppy joe like taste periodtoken none of these made the food bad commatoken but the same items at the 12 south location tasted more refined overall of a higher quality periodtoken that being said commatoken the cool springs locations features some menu items not found in 12 south periodtoken we enjoyed the fried green beans commatoken and if i werent full from popcorn and soda from the movies commatoken i wouldve loved to have tried a milkshake periodtoken   tldr great vibe and decor commatoken but the food just wasnt the same as the original location periodtoken","7006":"here on business and ate at this restaurant twice periodtoken i am being generous with 3 stars because the food was ok as expected periodtoken service was good on the first visit and thats why the 3 periodtoken food was good both times periodtoken on the second visit commatoken had very poor service from my waitress periodtoken they were busy it was saturday night periodtoken the attitude of my server when i had my meal served with the wrong type of chicken was commatoken thats what you ordered periodtoken it was not periodtoken she exchanged it quickly and was short when i paid periodtoken its a thankless job but telling a customer even at jrs its your fault will be why i wont go back periodtoken","7007":"went here for a coworkers birthday today for lunch periodtoken loved the overall atmosphere and ambience periodtoken i ordered the asian chicken salad and tomato basil soup which was the soup of the day periodtoken the soup was excellent will definitely order again and i actually wished i had ordered the big bowl periodtoken on to the salad periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken very good as well love the textures and flavors in it periodtoken only problem was the chicken periodtoken i really cannot describe to you what was wrong with it because i cannot quite put my finger on it periodtoken i just found myself eating around it periodtoken  maybe mine was just a fluke i am not sure periodtoken  if i decide to try it again i will just omit the chicken from the salad periodtoken   and last but not least the reason i am writing this review periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken 2 of my coworkers ordered the mediterranean  flat bread pizza periodtoken amazing i immediately regretted not ordering it periodtoken if you like veggie pizza you cannot go wrong and for all you vegetarians it is one of the few options you have here periodtoken i liked it so much that i ordered one to go periodtoken i admit it did not taste as great the next day periodtoken i will be back but i will go for happy hour next time my coworker raved about the mixed drinks so much that i have to see for myself","7011":"a quaint oldstyle southern restaurant periodtoken  i had the brownie sundae sugar coma and hubby had a malt periodtoken  we got there just at closing periodtoken  a lady was playing a piano and came by our table to ask for song requests periodtoken   i read that the place used to be a drug store on the ground floor and a hospital on the 2nd floorbuilt in 1898  periodtoken  its got charming atmosphere and the desserts are hand made commatoken not shipped in periodtoken","7012":"its a nice commatoken local commatoken neighborhood joint periodtoken acts a kind of a neighborhood hub periodtoken good cookies which is key commatoken good sandwichs and i am told the soup is good too although i have never had it periodtoken breakfast or lunch commatoken youre good either way periodtoken","7015":"nashville doesnt have a lot of international markets periodtoken   i love diverse and ethnic food periodtoken my husband is peruvian and in order to make his traditional dishes we need things like aji amarillo commatoken aji panca or other classic peruvian specialties periodtoken there is a lot you can find at this store  whether you need chinese commatoken mexican commatoken asian commatoken japenese or anything inbetween periodtoken its a great store to pick  up canned or packaged products periodtoken   with saying that commatoken i would warn on the quality of meats or seafood periodtoken we typically get tripe at different stores commatoken and the tripe there was frozen and yellow periodtoken i have seen packages of beef look extremely brown or fish smell periodtoken even a lot of the shellfish is completely opened up or dead commatoken which shows the conditions for keeping it fresh arent up to standard periodtoken","7023":"i wish there was a gets the job done option periodtoken  it was serviceable food commatoken good price commatoken subpar service periodtoken  i feel like carryout is the way to go periodtoken  the inside is beautiful and clean commatoken but service is not great periodtoken  i was nearly finished with my hot and sour soup before they brought our drinks commatoken and then only because i asked for them again periodtoken  the food was ok commatoken good sized portions commatoken not the most delicious i have had commatoken but tasty periodtoken  i love general tsos and this version was alright but too much ginger flavor for me and not at all spicy periodtoken the chicken was all white meat commatoken but very overcooked and some pieces were pretty tough periodtoken  but you got a large portion with chicken fried rice for less than 8 periodtoken  i might get carryout on the way home commatoken but i dont see going back to dine in anytime soon periodtoken","7025":"since toppers is near my office commatoken when we decided to order lunch in a few days ago commatoken i decided to try a new pizza place periodtoken we settled on a thin crust veggie pizza commatoken cheesy stix commatoken and hot wings for three of us plus extra to share periodtoken they delivered exactly at their estimated time periodtoken we all liked it  nothing too exciting commatoken but definitely good periodtoken my one coworker found a few hairs on one of his slices that didnt appear to be any of ours commatoken so that was kind of gross commatoken but it happens commatoken i suppose periodtoken since everything else was otherwise good commatoken id go back periodtoken","7026":"i have dined here many times commatoken probably never on a tuesday periodtoken the food was bland and thoughtless periodtoken  i have had the pasta and fagioli many times commatoken and never been so disappointed periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhope you try harder next time periodtoken","7027":"well commatoken we have been to bjs twice now commatoken so here is what we think periodtoken  the good bjs has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long periodtoken  the bad bjs has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long periodtoken  bjs is one of those restaurants that cannot decide if it is a steakhouse commatoken a brew house commatoken an italian restaurant commatoken a pizza parlor commatoken a rib joint commatoken or a burger place periodtoken as is so frequently the case with restaurants that try to do so many things commatoken it ends up not doing any of them very well periodtoken the servers seem to have a lot of trouble answering questions commatoken because there is such a massive amount to remember periodtoken frequently they have to pass such tough questions as can i get that with mushrooms on to the kitchen manager commatoken who appears to be in a black hole from which your server may never return periodtoken  on to the food periodtoken first visit we had salmon commatoken which had a very nice flavor but was a bit over cooked periodtoken this time we first ordered calamari as an appetizer commatokenwhich was nicely battered and fried with good marinara and horseradish dipping sauces periodtoken we then both ordered the rib eyes commatoken each medium rare periodtoken the cooking was fine periodtoken the quality of the meat was terrible periodtoken we have been around a good while commatoken and these were the toughest commatoken most gristly rib eyes we have ever eaten commatoken or at least tried to eat periodtoken when we arrived home commatoken rex the amazing wonder dog ended up eating most of them periodtoken he thought they were great periodtoken then again commatoken he eats cat litter periodtoken  grandson had a burger and fries commatoken which he gave his 8 year olds thumbs up to periodtoken if the ketchup on his face was any measure commatoken both must have been good periodtoken  beer selection was wide but not more than the average brew house periodtoken  so all in all commatoken a great big mediocre for bjs periodtoken if you are in the area of the outlet mall in wesley chapel commatoken there are numerous other places to choose from periodtoken think about them periodtoken think about them hard periodtoken","7029":"not the best chinese food ive ever had but not the worst either periodtoken  this place is alright periodtoken  i love the fried donuts they have for a dollar periodtoken  they are so delicious and come out piping hot  i also enjoy their crab ragoons and hot and sour soup periodtoken  the fried rice left much to be desired periodtoken","7030":"the one and only sushi place to get your sushi fix in iv periodtoken ive been here a handful of times when ive been too lazy to go to sushi ahi at the marketplace periodtoken its never crazy busy and you get your order within 15 min if theres no one else around which seems a bit much commatoken but i have enough patience to wait periodtoken im not that adventurous when it comes to sushi commatoken but i have to say their california rolls are pretty good periodtokenthe cost of the sushi itself is a bit pricey for the quality commatoken and sometimes quantity commatoken that you get periodtoken i mean i got 2 mini hand rolls for 4 dollars when i could have gotten 2 large hand rolls for 6 dollars at the marketplace periodtoken  bottom line a good place to go when you are attacked by that sushi craving periodtoken","7034":"food was ok for my i dont like sea food much my gf loved the calamari pasta periodtoken location was nice periodtoken it def gets crowded and we waited for an hour before we were able to eat periodtoken   the reason 3 stars is i asked for light wine in my pasta and they did not do that periodtoken also it is a very cramped inside stools so close to one another periodtoken if you want more space fire 4 people eat outside but bring a jacket if there for dinner it gets windy and a bit cold periodtoken","7045":"weak steamed clams periodtoken the waiter was great and the view was wonderful so go for that the bisque was way to much on the tomato side than he lobster","7046":"really 3 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken pub and kitchen is tasty commatoken and has a great beer selection but the food menu is limited periodtoken there are about 56 items of very pricey entrees commatoken and 56 more reasonably priced sandwiches periodtoken they used to have fish and chips on the menu commatoken but unfortunately this item has been removed periodtoken the burger was awesome commatoken and cooked perfectly commatoken although it seemed there was about 14 piece of bacon on it periodtoken the pulled pork was also really delish and unique commatoken and the coleslaw accompanying it was great commatoken but i wish this came with fries commatoken too periodtoken the service was good commatoken but our server checked on us frequently commatoken bordering on uncomfortably too much periodtoken i would definitely go back for a beer and a burger commatoken and the company commatoken the best parts of the night","7047":"middle of the road periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken beer just ok at best periodtoken service was a notch lower than that periodtoken cool building but lacks adequate parking periodtoken given that the building exudes an almost religious brewery vibe commatoken they just did not get all the way to good in my opinion periodtoken both times we have been there commatoken our server was trying way too hard to be cool and did not try hard enough to provide good service periodtoken overall commatoken i surely expected more from a brewery located in a building like this periodtoken too many other breweries in the area that are head and shoulders better than indiana city brewing periodtoken","7048":"we went to the opening day commatoken which was a little chaotic commatoken but they had lovely free pastries and coffee commatoken so we gave high point a second run today periodtoken a little bit disappointed tbh periodtoken its fine periodtoken but overall commatoken somewhat expensive and not terribly inspiring  service commatoken coffee and crepes just ok periodtoken  they havent tried to do anything fresh with the mugshots space commatoken which would have given it a more distinctive identity periodtoken were huge fans of the vineyard cafe commatoken which has fantastic crepes and some of the best service in the neighborhood commatoken so im not sure wed go out of our way to give high point a third go periodtoken they might have to up their game in a neighborhood with this many great options periodtoken","7050":"it was okay periodtoken  i purchased enchiladas and my son purchased a quesadilla periodtoken  he had to go inside because the quesadilla wasnt put in the bag periodtoken  the horchata was just mediocre periodtoken  its nice to have authentic mexican through a drive thru periodtoken  the prices and serving sizes were adequate but i think there are better options in the area periodtoken","7056":"i came in here for the first time periodtoken i usually go to chickafil but wanted to try something different periodtoken i got the grilled chicken salad periodtoken it was good nothing special and wasnt any better that other places i get a chicken salad from periodtoken inside it was decorated nice though periodtoken","7057":"good service and food is good periodtoken  however commatoken the food is the american version of what mexican food should be plus the prices are a little in the expensive side periodtoken that said the place is in great location and the perfect place to spent an early friday or saturday night with a date or friends periodtoken reason for the rating is the prices periodtoken","7062":"3 periodtoken25  pretty good overall food  service  menu  smores sundae  3 periodtoken25 pretty good frozen custard commatoken although wisconsin is still my gold standard","7063":"this is the first time l have ever been to a cracker barrel periodtoken i went with my sister and her kids periodtoken the table i was seated at had ketchup on it periodtoken i didnt realize it until i put my arm down on the table periodtoken this was way before we got food or drinks periodtoken the floor behind me was filthy as well periodtoken ketchup and left over food on the floor between our table and the table behind me periodtoken i never would have paid attention if it wasnt for my niece dropping her toy constantly on the floor periodtoken thats enough to be hesitant to stay periodtoken then we get the food periodtoken the fried chicken and macaroni  cheese were the best part of the meal periodtoken my mash potatoes were barely like warm in the middle commatoken  almost cold periodtoken plus the mash potatoes and fried apples were bland periodtoken the gravy they used on the mash potatoes was really good also periodtoken right after i left the restaurant commatoken my sister pointed out a bunch of food stains on my back periodtoken needless to say i was shocked periodtoken i just bought this shirt the precious day in ny at the nintendo store periodtoken now its ruined periodtoken i washed it once and it still hasnt came out yet periodtoken i am not happy since i do live out of state on the west coast periodtoken its not like i can go back easily and grab another periodtoken  my only positive on this restaurant was the staff periodtoken the staff was very polite and offered us great service with 2 rambunctious 3 year olds periodtoken from the wait staff to the store staff everyone was polite periodtoken  despite my positive on the staff i dont want to go back their anymore periodtoken even to the one and only restaurant thats open in my city periodtoken this place did not live up to its hype periodtoken maybe it should focus more on the restaurant side rather then the store periodtoken the store despite the crowd was impeccable periodtoken nothing out of place and a person to put it back as soon as it was moved periodtoken if the restaurant had that same attention to detail commatoken it would improve it a great deal periodtoken","7066":"delicious organic burger commatoken but a bit overpriced for the size periodtoken sweet potato fries excellent commatoken but also overpriced periodtoken  service is good periodtoken","7068":"great margaritas periodtoken good service periodtoken clean establishment periodtoken space enough between tables periodtoken indoor and outdoor seating periodtoken good locale periodtoken  food i wasnt impressed with my taco choices periodtoken  i got the korean bbq commatoken and the special country fried chicken and gravy periodtoken neither jumped out at me and made me happy periodtoken  very little substance in the taco periodtoken periodtoken tiny quantity commatoken and no real pizzazz as far as cilantro commatoken shredded cabbage commatoken whatever periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  very dull commatoken in fact periodtoken   salsa was mediocre commatoken as well periodtoken periodtoken  so  food 3 periodtoken everything else 45 periodtoken  i would go back for a pitcher of margaritas commatoken but id probably bring my own salsa periodtoken","7070":"this place is not a bad stop for mexican food periodtoken  very clean commatoken easy to read detailed menu and kind staff periodtoken  we had a large party and some of the food was not hot at delivery periodtoken  although the place was not crowded at all commatoken the waiters could have checked in with us more often periodtoken  with a smaller group maybe a 4 person family i think it would be a lot better periodtoken","7073":"place is ok periodtoken  food average periodtoken  maybe i just ordered the least favorite items periodtoken  nachos are average commatoken maple bacon slab was ok periodtoken fried shrimp with mango was ok as well periodtoken  sorry i can rave about this place although i pass it every day periodtoken  this was my second visit periodtoken  my first was much better  on the week they opened ","7076":"after a big lunch commatoken we decided to swing by district donuts and give the donuts here a try periodtoken being in the middle of the afternoon commatoken there wasnt a long line commatoken and getting seating inside wasnt too hard either periodtoken the vibe is pretty relaxed commatoken with a spacious feel commatoken some industrial finishes commatoken and spacious booths commatoken bar seating commatoken and some outdoor spots as well if you want to sit down periodtoken most of the attention was focused on the donuts commatoken but as the name suggests commatoken they also serve sandwiches and coffee here  so a little bit of everything for everyone periodtoken we ended up sticking with donuts commatoken trying out the chocolate glaze commatoken spicy maple praline commatoken and cookies and cream periodtoken  howd it shake out to be honest commatoken i was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that i had seen on here and other places on the internet periodtoken the donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side commatoken and outside of the maple praline commatoken i didnt think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts i have had periodtoken i do have a soft spot in my heart and belly for maple donuts commatoken which explains why i liked that the best flavorwise  but it also didnt have any hint of spiciness at all commatoken which makes me wonder why the description even bothered periodtoken the chocolate glazed donut was very average to me commatoken and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthere was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top periodtoken  overall commatoken the donuts are different from what youd pick up at a krispy kreme or dunkin donuts commatoken but it didnt measure up to the uniqueness and tastiness of other donutcentric shops that i have been to periodtoken i would like to come back and try the sandwiches commatoken which looked tasty commatoken but from a donut standpoint commatoken i came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectations periodtoken","7077":"i really commatoken really want to like this place more periodtoken i love the fact that there is a local coffee place within walking distance of my work so that i can help the local economy while obtaining my caffeine fix periodtoken   the only problem is that to me commatoken northwest just isnt that good periodtoken i like the environment and ive always been able to find a seat if need be periodtoken its also fun to see so many local clayton people going about their days both in and out of the shop periodtoken but the employees are always very hit or miss periodtoken all of the ladies are very nice but some of the guys are very blunt and unpersonable periodtoken maybe not morning people who knows periodtoken   i have never been impressed with their food case selection periodtoken the options never rotate hope you either like cranberry walnut or chocolate and some of their offers are just marked up things from companion up the street periodtoken granted i have never had their fresh made options which ive heard are good periodtoken   they have some sort of digital punch card but i had to ask about it to sign up after having gone in the stop about 34 times a week for a month periodtoken i feel like they should have a sign about it at the register unless they just hope people dont know about it so they dont have to give you freebies periodtoken its also hit or miss on if your cashier will ask you for your punch card number commatoken so remember to bring it up if you want your points periodtoken   the coffee itself is good commatoken both hot and iced periodtoken as a coffee glutton i wish they would offer one more size up commatoken but that cant really be helped periodtoken i wish they also made better dirty chai lattes because the one i had there was abysmal and undrinkable periodtoken  i want to love you commatoken northwest i guess i just wish you cared about variety and your customers a little more periodtoken despite this ill probably keep going here just because my options are slim periodtoken hopefully ill grow to like you better in time periodtoken","7086":"food was good but its overpriced periodtoken staff wasnt friendly or rude periodtoken restaurant wasnt clean commatoken they need to wipe down the tables and clean the floors periodtoken","7089":"eliscoreometer 313  being in santa barbara always makes me crave seafood periodtoken either than or chorizo soaked in cheese periodtoken given that seafood is abundant in the wharf areas commatoken and that my company and i had worked up an appetite running around the beach commatoken i opted to bring is here periodtoken   first commatoken the company i was with could brighten any day commatoken so mood did not really affect this perspective periodtoken second commatoken wine was poured so that also improved the spirits periodtoken however commatoken there were some nottobe overlooked flaws and shortcomings to this place periodtoken   the menu is a bit confusing periodtoken should i look at the menu or the chalkboard ahead of me commatoken or the random appetizers haphazardly scattered around the place on small chalkboards this made it very hard for us to make orders that were of sound judgement periodtoken but we persevered periodtoken   oysters blue  local periodtoken flavorful commatoken fresh commatoken very poorly shucked periodtoken not a single one i had was cleaned properly of grit periodtoken additionally commatoken many large chunks of shell were common in each one periodtoken really not pleasant commatoken but they were so rushed commatoken who cares  rock crab their specialty was tasty commatoken though probably less than 3lbs quoted periodtoken yet it was hard to compare against the size of the enormous spider crabs being hacked to bits through the window periodtoken theres very little that can be incorrect about the preparation of this item periodtoken served with butter an cocktail sauce and a number of wipes periodtoken   abalone periodtoken served fried over tomato rice pilaf of a sort periodtoken it was reminiscent of a risotto commatoken but thats neither here nor there periodtoken the abalone was tender enough commatoken lightly breaded commatoken and tasty periodtoken it was probably the best item commatoken but something we ordered after we noticed it in some tiny corner of the blackboard periodtoken it was difficult to get the waiter back to make the order periodtoken   overall commatoken the meal was fine periodtoken however commatoken the constant negative chatter from the unseated guests piling up behind us and shoved into the entranceway was unappealing periodtoken they were hungry and irritated by the lack of service periodtoken commenting about what we were eating and how long it was taking periodtoken but the restaurant did nothing to deal with the massive crowd periodtoken ill stick to brophys or any one of the hundred other seafood establishments that offer a much better experience periodtoken","7093":"its really a good lunch spot on weekdays periodtoken low price and limited choices periodtoken taste is so so though periodtoken i ordered thai hot pot thinking its spicy periodtoken but i really cant tell afterwards what does that hot mean periodtoken its neither spicy nor hot as in more than warm periodtoken also commatoken im never sure whether should i leave tips at a place like this commatoken you know commatoken seems like a fast food joint but still with some sevice periodtoken","7094":"if you find yourself in terminal d commatoken definitely check this place out periodtoken they have pretty decent sandwiches for you to enjoy there or on your flight periodtoken probably one of the better sandwiches ive had at an airport for sure periodtoken i have to agree that its extremely slow so i would not recommend stopping if you gotta move quickly periodtoken it took us about 20 minutes to receive our food periodtoken we ordered the roast beef and smoked turkey sandwich commatoken both really good periodtoken im not sure what the long wait was about but if you have the time to kill which most people do in an airport commatoken check this place out periodtoken","7098":"ive been drinking la colombe for years and i have been twice disappointed with the nizza espresso here periodtoken the first time i visited this location i ordered a cortadogibraltar commatoken excited since i hadnt had la colombe in a year and a half commatoken and i was feeling nostalgic periodtoken i already knew something looked wrong from the darker color of the coffee swirled in the milk periodtoken it was burnt yes i know the color of the crema doesnt matter but it does matter if it normally is lighter and the same coffee i drank it commatoken but i didnt enjoy it periodtoken i probably shouldve said something commatoken but alas i didnt and checked it off as a bad oneoff periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   a few weeks later a month maybe i return to the same location and decide to order an espresso periodtoken the nizza once again periodtoken giving it another chance to redeem itself periodtoken the barista started talking to me commatoken asking me questions commatoken trying to have a conversation while he was pulling the shot commatoken maybe thats what killed it periodtoken i took my coffee and sat down with the rest of my party already having noticed that the crema was very dark commatoken not a definite sign of burnt but i could smell it periodtoken one other person in my group also had his coffee their regular drip burnt as well periodtoken even less drinkable than mine periodtoken to the point where he commatoken a person who basically never takes anything back commatoken took it back which they did when they smelled it and realized it was really burnt periodtoken i had already chugged half of mine so i decided to stomach it again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   maybe theyre fazing out their nizza and i should try their new single origin next time i will periodtoken stick to the craft coffee my friends periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken la colombe atmosphere is so nice commatoken their pastries delicious commatoken but i dont dare try their nizza ever again at this location periodtoken will update my review next time im in town periodtoken","7100":"we ordered take out it was good periodtoken the meat was good commatoken but just good periodtoken it was pretty oily though periodtoken the fries were good commatoken crispy which i liked periodtoken the shakes were very yummy i do recommend those vanilla and chocolate periodtoken","7102":"i am not sure how this place get such good reviews commatoken since it is all prepackaged tourist food periodtoken the grouperwhich you should get blackened was pretty decent periodtoken i got that as the substitute for haddock periodtoken it cost five dollars for the upgrade but was worth it periodtoken the scallops were good commatoken as was the grilled shrimp commatoken but the green beans were terrible periodtoken the crabcakes were awful too periodtoken its an ok location commatoken but you have to pay for parking like every other place in clearwater periodtoken it tasted no different than joes crap shack periodtoken the best part about this place was the service periodtoken i have to say that stacy was very attentive commatoken very professional and made it a more enjoyable experience periodtoken","7103":"the service was great periodtoken  i think the guy was the owner possibly periodtoken but the crepes were not proportioned right periodtoken  the one i had had too many blackberries and too much mascarpone cheese periodtoken  the one my brother got had so much nutella and cherries commatoken it looked kinda like a nutella soup periodtoken hopefully they step up their game periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i really want them to do good","7104":"pancake pantry smentry periodtoken this place is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overrated periodtoken this was one of the first breakfast joints that ive tried when i first moved to nashville periodtoken people couldnt stop raving about this place periodtoken so i dragged my friends out of their bed on a sat morning to wait 40 mins before we got our table periodtoken   the service was descent and so were their breakfast periodtoken its not anything to die for periodtoken i guess i didnt get the memo commatoken but whats so special i would have given this place two stars due to their long line and them not opening for lunch or dinner only breakfast commatoken but they get a bump up because their potato pancake was pretty good commatoken but thats about it periodtoken   maybe i was irritated and anticipating some food to die for commatoken but this was ok periodtoken sure commatoken its better than the chain pancake places commatoken but not specialty store where i would wait longer than 15 mins","7107":"this review is just a warning periodtoken  if you order online commatoken the catalog description will give the year or vintage of the wine along with the points periodtoken  however   there are these little boxes that are automatically checked for you unless you uncheck them in which you agree they can switch the vintage periodtoken      even if you search their site indicating you only want to see wines that are in stock in a particular store commatoken they do inventory only on the wine regardless of the year periodtoken   you go to pick up you order and lo and behold commatoken many of the wines are unavailable  and i mean more than half periodtoken     so for example if you choose a pinot noir  2011 rated high by users and with 90 wine points rating commatoken  they can substitute 2012 even though that year  may be horrible periodtoken  my advice save yourself the trouble and dont use their website periodtoken   go to the store periodtoken that said the store is huge  and does have good prices periodtoken   especially on their 5 cent sale periodtoken","7110":"great coffee drinks commatoken great pastry asiago cheeseanything always wins my favor periodtoken  reasonable prices and very popular with the sitdownlaptopornewspaper table squatters and the walkin crowd that commatoken judging by the efficiency of the line  knows how to navigate this popular spot periodtoken","7114":"was said to be the best in philly periodtoken did not hold up to that name periodtoken the fries were good but would not say the best i had periodtoken i had the blackened chicken breast with shrimp periodtoken they went way overboard with the spice  periodtoken the chicken was juicy on the inside though periodtoken i ended up eating only a little of it periodtoken wifey enjoyed the broil seafood platter periodtoken and i enjoyed her fish and shrimp more than she did periodtoken  the pineapple cake desert was on the money periodtoken you can not go wrong with that periodtoken our waitress was kind and attentive periodtoken and though we used a groupon for dinner periodtoken she removed my chicken dinner from the bill because i did not eat it periodtoken that was very nice of her periodtoken so though not the best food in philly periodtoken it is a nice place to eat periodtoken and the decor was how  a seafood restaurant should be periodtoken  i can not say we will visit it again periodtoken but i am sure they will do well periodtoken","7117":"let me start out by saying that i loved my breakfast  i had the crawfish omelet commatoken and it was wonderful periodtoken crawfish were fresh and hot periodtoken  rest of the  meal was just average periodtoken  it was crowded and load periodtoken but commatoken i guess that is a sign of good food periodtoken  my problem was that you had to move the mop bucket out of the way to get to the cooler with the juices and milk periodtoken  ick staff was very friendly periodtoken","7119":"good a periodtokenk periodtokena periodtoken only choice for frozen yogurt in manayunk periodtoken the yogurt flavors are extensive and the topping bar has an overwhelming amount of fruits and candies to chose from periodtoken i also like the option of turning your creation into a smoothie periodtoken   what i dislike about whirled peace is the layout periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken when it comes to froyo people can be indecisive and want to tastetest or play around with the flavor combos periodtoken this makes it difficult for someone commatoken me commatoken who is very decisive about her yogurt selection commatoken have to wait around during the hemming and hawing commatoken or cut around you to the toppings periodtoken either way commatoken the layout is a little annoying periodtoken also commatoken i find it a bit expensive periodtoken but it does hit the spot when you have a froyo craving periodtoken","7121":"another mediocre tampa mexican joint periodtoken the state of mexican food in tampa bay is just so so sad periodtoken if you eat here commatoken the best thing was the carnitas tacos periodtoken  dear xtreme if you are reading this review commatoken please get real ac periodtoken your ac sucks and its always 1 commatoken000 degrees in there periodtoken  parking is also a problemo here periodtoken","7123":"the review is for the restaurant not the food periodtoken the food is amazing and the quality is great periodtoken the restaurant is ok as far as cleanliness but its cold omg commatoken its soooo cold in here im shaking its always like this and if you are cold natured get take out i am going to bring a thermometer next time but guessing 58ish in here periodtoken the soap dispenser in the restroom doesnt work unless you work for it commatoken hope the employees have another place to wash hands periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken second time ive been here that the soap has been sketchy periodtoken had the chicken with verde sauce commatoken it was terrific periodtoken again commatoken eat here commatoken bring a parka would be four stars if it were comfortable in here but trying to eat with teeth chattering sucks","7125":"for all the hype i heard about pp commatoken i just dont think it lived up to my expectations periodtoken we waited about 30 minutes on a monday which it seems like is on the shorter end and i thought it was ok periodtoken maybe i my expectations were too high or i ordered wrong periodtoken i actually got lunch the turkey wrap commatoken which i understand isnt their specailty but i also got a pancake on the side nice you can do that which was good and i also liked the warm syrup bottles on every table periodtoken they do have quite an extensive pancake menu periodtoken  it is a cozy restaurant and definitely a good place for breakfast commatoken i was just expecting out of this world periodtoken as with most of the people in nashville commatoken the server was very friendly and even split our checks without asking periodtoken if you are in town for a short trip and the wait is 2 hours commatoken i dont think its necessarily worth the wait but is a good spot if you have time periodtoken","7127":"i had a cl deal to burn and ordered the bistec ala mexican strip steak last thursday night periodtoken  the steak was nicely cooked and well seasoned commatoken as were the saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers periodtoken the black beans were good but nothing overly impressive periodtoken  the bartender i ordered with was helpful and friendly periodtoken  my issue was with the size of the entree periodtoken  as one of the priciest options on the menu the portion should be enough for a meal periodtoken  this was reminiscent of the scaled down sizes served to earlybirds or as lunch periodtoken  it wouldnt have even filled a single tortilla periodtoken  the only sufficient portion was the big pile of rice periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken go figure periodtoken luckily i had a cl deal commatoken otherwise i wouldnt been more upset periodtoken","7134":"jess was fun and attentive as bartenders go periodtoken periodtoken she definitely had her regulars small town bar but she and they made me feel like one of the crew periodtoken food was okay commatoken sauce was good but my bacon was burned and part of the pork was dry periodtoken periodtoken overall it was an enjoyable time periodtoken good place to catch a ballgame periodtoken","7135":"i absolutely love this place food is very good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken beer is cold and a great variety periodtoken facility is clean periodtoken service is extremely inconsistent periodtoken  i have been to this location several times and each time it is like going to a different restaurant periodtoken  for the first time we had a great server rachel  although the service was slow she was great periodtoken   again out order was wrong commatoken  but she actually caught it before we could say anything periodtoken   she apologized and coolrrected it immediately periodtoken  not sure if the problem is corporate or local management but someone needs to address the inconsistency in everything from service to portion size to timing periodtoken  overall if you have time it is worth the wait commatoken but dont go starving or you may not make it before you are initially served periodtoken  12 minutes from sitting to getting my beer periodtoken","7137":"hardees is the red headed step child when it comes to fast food commatoken it always seems to take a back seat to mcdonalds commatoken wendys and jack in the box periodtoken however i always forget that their food is actually better than all of the other options periodtoken  i stopped by this location while in a hurry and needed a quick meal periodtoken i opted for the chicken tender sandwich commatoken which was three chicken tenders with honey mustard commatoken bacon commatoken and cheese on a standard bun periodtoken the chicken tenders were good commatoken not dried out like some places periodtoken  this location was clean with a friendly staff periodtoken","7140":"what is great about this starbucks is its location commatoken as gerald s noted periodtoken   given the dearth of decent to go coffee purveyors in this area commatoken starbucks is a nice addition to this neighborhood periodtoken   as other yelpers have noted commatoken this is a relatively small store periodtoken  it has comfy chairs and is a nice place to meet a friend for coffee and convo periodtoken the staff is pleasant and helpful even if they are not always burdened with a sense of urgency periodtoken","7141":"oh commatoken the pancake  many a hungover breakfast was spent there in my single days periodtoken  this place is fun if you want to meet up with your friends in the village and stand in line a long time  out the door or wake up at 200 p periodtokenm periodtoken and roll in shortly before close periodtoken  i love southern breakfast food periodtoken  while this is standard fare commatoken the reason why pancake got so popular commatoken for people wondering what the big deal is commatoken has to do with nashville being music city u periodtokens periodtokena periodtoken and musicians eating there not so much for the food periodtoken  that is the secret periodtoken  i commatoken personally commatoken am not a country music fan nor have i ever been the star struck type periodtoken  who knows or cares whether the rich and famous even deign to descend on the pancake anymore periodtoken  but commatoken as a native nashvillian reading the bad reviews here commatoken i feel it my duty to give you the dl on why pancake became the hot spot that it is

the food if it is supposed to be what i know from greece periodtoken i even prefer turkish food to what ive had at kanella periodtoken   the food at kanella isnt bad commatoken for what it is periodtoken i cant say whether it is authentic cypriot cuisine periodtoken its nothing like mainland greek cuisine periodtoken i can say for sure at least from a northern greek perspective commatoken there are better options in the city in this price range periodtoken try estia periodtoken  that all said commatoken the service was friendly periodtoken best part of the whole meal was the desserts and coffee periodtoken if the place werent so small commatoken and perhaps had lots of sidewalk seating in summertime commatoken i would be there several nights per week just for desert and coffee periodtoken but this is philadelphia periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","7147":"popovers and blondies commatoken both very well done commatoken though not much else to add other than if youre in the mood for a delicious blondie in a romantic setting commatoken come to blondies periodtoken they do have one of the nicest sitting areas in downtown st periodtoken louis with a nice fireplace commatoken plush seating and pastel colors commatoken as well as an outdoor area to enjoy the outdoor happenings of washington ave commatoken their hours have changed so check in if theyll have a live band or be open late in the evening periodtoken","7148":"this place seems destined to fail commatoken which is too bad periodtoken  maybe with the new museum right across the street it will be saved periodtoken  the food is ok commatoken the prices a bit high for the offering commatoken but the setting is pretty awesome periodtoken  quiet and relaxing without pushing you out the door periodtoken    i dont know much about the area commatoken but imagine this would be a great place to have a wedding or event commatoken and a nice place to grab a cup of coffee on a weekend morning periodtoken   good luck to them periodtoken","7149":"very pleasant dining commatoken particularly on the outdoor deck overlooking the schuylkill and its busy adjacent sidewalks periodtoken did not try the pizzas commatoken but they looked and smelled good as they went by periodtoken a broccolini salad was a generous portion commatoken with long shavings of parmigiano and prosciutto periodtoken some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice periodtoken the famous meatballs were periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendifferent commatoken with a vealtomato sauce and pine nuts very good commatoken but some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice periodtoken at 11 commatoken though commatoken for three averagesize meatballs i thought that was a bit high periodtoken a sea scallop appetizer was quite good also commatoken but at 15 for just two scallops commatoken that was a bit high periodtoken some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice periodtoken a small dollop of spaghetti with rock shrimp and a two cooked slices of cappacolle gobagool in a spicy tomato and squid ink sauce looked disgusting on the plate commatoken but was delicious periodtoken at 14 for such a small portion commatoken i thought it was commatoken as they say in the trade commatoken a bit high commatoken and some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice commatoken to mop up the sauce periodtoken  if someone else is paying commatoken youll love in riva periodtoken  all employees were efficient and most kind indeed periodtoken hopefully one of them will think commatoken hey we  know how to make great pizza crust why dont we roll some into loaf shapes and make bread to slice for the patrons delicious appetizers and entrees theyll say were nice","7156":"this is a really attractive place with a friendly staff periodtoken last time we were there we shared the place with a brewery tour bus commatoken so it was a festive atmosphere periodtoken i really did not like any of the beers i tasted commatoken though periodtoken perhaps its just me periodtoken","7158":"these donuts were pretty good commatoken a bit more cakey than other donuts weve had commatoken but the unique flavors had us really interested periodtoken we ordered the the apple jelly filled commatoken the cranapple filled commatoken and two classic chocolate donuts periodtoken they were good to try periodtoken i will say there wasnt a ton of filling in the jellyfilled donuts commatoken we were surprised at how little periodtoken they tasted as though they were a couple days old periodtoken the customer service was top notch commatoken though periodtoken   the location was great when we arrived shortly after 930am on a friday but id imagine it could get very cramped very quickly periodtoken i was surprised there wasnt really any place to eat the donuts in the shop commatoken but we found a park nearby periodtoken","7160":"another burger joint in town periodtoken  burger and fries eaten were ok periodtoken  i will return to try the signature milk shakes","7162":"this place came to town with a huge reputation out west and a huge ego commatoken and i think the people of indianapolis should slap the shit out of them for their cockiness and tell them to make a better freaking burger periodtoken   when you walk in the walls are adorned with a thousand magazine articles heralding the place periodtoken you would think it was la bernadine or something periodtoken la bernadine is a 4 star restaurant in new york owned and operated by eric ripert periodtoken eric ripert is one of the best chefs in the world periodtoken anyway commatoken the place thinks is the shit commatoken but in stead of being commatoken the shit commatoken its just shit periodtoken i had the cajun fries with my underwhelming burger commatoken and they were gross too periodtoken   the burger was so unappealing periodtoken it had minimal flavor commatoken and im guessing they arent using the best beef in the world periodtoken the topping options are sparse and the dining options are more sparse still commatoken would you like a burger periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenor a periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenburger   i was looking forward to the experience because of the swagger commatoken but left with more of a stagger periodtoken","7163":"not really as bad as people say periodtoken i come here a lot because it somewhat satisfies my constant cravings for japanese food without having to commute all the way to state street or goleta periodtoken  while the place does seem a little sketchy commatoken the rolls are pretty solid periodtoken the hungry roll is huge and not to mention deep fried periodtoken its good commatoken unique commatoken and filling and comes with miso soup so yummy and salad the kiss dragon roll was pretty good as well periodtoken  i tried the sashimi dinner plate today and it was a little sketch periodtoken only the salmon and tuna tasted legit while the other fish didnt taste as fresh periodtoken i dont think this is the best place to come for raw fish or ramen for that matter the ramen is basically ramen noodles placed in a generic udon broth periodtoken   order the chicken katsu plate or sesame chicken but keep in mind that the portions arent exactly worth the price you pay in terms of the entrees and sashimi periodtoken   however commatoken if you are looking for a decent japanese place commatoken come here for the specialty rolls their lunch happy hour is a pretty good deal too commatoken so check that out periodtoken the only thing is that some of the dishes are way too expensive for the quantity they give periodtoken other than that commatoken id come back for the rolls","7167":"the beer selection here is ok periodtoken the problem is you cant taste any of it before you buy it periodtoken if im going to pay almost 15 for a growler commatoken i want to make sure i like what im getting periodtoken the staff seemed polite and knowledgeable commatoken but descriptions of beers only go so far periodtoken if i want to pick up a growler on this side of town commatoken ill be going down the street a bit commatoken where they have just as good of selection and you can sample it first periodtoken","7170":"this place is generally hit or miss periodtoken when its on its game commatoken its awesome commatoken but when its a miss its all kinds of frustrating periodtoken  a big part of the quality is how many people are staffed and who is cooking the burgers periodtoken when theres more than one person behind the counter the service is generally prompt and at least courteous commatoken and when the cook makes your burger the way you want it the food is spot on periodtoken their fries are always amazing commatoken especially the truffle fries periodtoken  things get problematic when theres only one person there to do register and cook commatoken or when your burger comes out overdone periodtoken ive gone in several times to find no one behind the counter and had to wait for several minutes before someone emerged from the back to take my order and make my food periodtoken once the guy who came out was on his phone commatoken and continued his conversation while ringing me out and then cooking my burger periodtoken   additionally commatoken the burgers are overdone one out of every three times periodtoken they have very specific descriptions of what youll get when you order your burger a specific way but they dont seem to adhere to that particularly well periodtoken i always order rare and im not always happy with what i get from the grill periodtoken  overall i like this place and ill keep going back commatoken but they need to step up their game periodtoken","7171":"the food was great commatoken but we went to this place because it had a starbucks inside or so we thought periodtoken periodtokenturns out they serve starbucks coffee but not all starbucks drinks periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlike an iced venti vanilla latte periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the parking was crazy periodtoken had to park in front of the dumpsters and because of how many people were trying to find a space or get out of there commatoken we had to exit through the drive thru periodtoken","7172":"sorry commatoken but this cuisine is average at best periodtoken seems like the frozen dinners i get not good periodtoken   the one thing that saved this restaurant from a twostar review is their genuine and happy customer service periodtoken   go in with your expectations at the right level periodtoken  ","7173":"ive been to hendricks a few times now and i would love to give it 5 stars commatoken but i dont think it deserves it i want to love it periodtoken the meat i would give 5 stars periodtoken the sauce i would give 4 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken but commatoken i think the sides are just lacking periodtoken there seems to be a problem with even knife cuts and inconsistent seasoning as well periodtoken  this time commatoken my mom had a giant uneven slice of tomato on her burger and the kitchen forgot to put the cheese on it periodtoken i love the corn casserole commatoken but it can sometimes be dry commatoken and this time it was lacking salt periodtoken the other sides ive experienced are the collard greens which were good commatoken but i just dont think i like collard greens periodtoken the baked beans were 5 star worthy periodtoken the sweet potato fries were cold and needed a lot more salt periodtoken they also were unevenly cut so some were more like chips and others were like fries periodtoken the creamed spinach was a little rich for me periodtoken i prefer my spinach a little less mushy and weighed down by heavy sauce periodtoken ive also tried the deviled eggs which were good periodtoken theyre super tangy and heavy on the mustard though commatoken so if you dont like mustard commatoken you wont like them periodtoken overall commatoken i like this place periodtoken the atmosphere and decoration is great periodtoken the smell is divine i love the meats and the sauces i just think they could do a little better on the sides periodtoken how hard is it to salt the food and cut it nicely","7175":"the food is always hot and enjoyable to eat periodtoken delivery is on point periodtoken only things you have to order 15 dollars for them to order the food to you periodtoken but most likely you will enjoy the food my favorite is general tso and plain fried rice periodtoken","7176":"i liked fired up bbq just ok periodtoken dont get me wrong im a carnivore periodtoken i love me my meat periodtoken but i just cant seem to get into southern barbeque periodtoken i think its the kind of bbq sauce i havent given up yet though  i think my experience with this place might also be skewed due to arriving about half an hour before closing commatoken so there was less variety for the meats and sides periodtoken none of the sides we tried were outstanding mac and cheese commatoken spanish rice commatoken southwestern corn commatoken potato salad periodtoken for meats we had ribs and brisket periodtoken huge portions so decent bang for your buck periodtoken the ribs were tender and falling of the bone unfortunately i like my ribs to have a little bit of chew with a smoky sauce commatoken which was ok but not for me periodtoken the brisket was excellent commatoken with a good balance of fat and meat commatoken cooked so that it shredded easily under my fork periodtoken they dont have fried chicken which kind of surprised me  isnt that a hallmark of southern food i could be wrong periodtoken  the place is kind of in a strange location commatoken and its got more of a fast food feel to it rather than sitdown restaurant commatoken by virtue of ordering at the front commatoken getting a plastic tray commatoken and having the meats and sides readymade behind the counter periodtoken overall commatoken if youre in the area or love barbeque commatoken its probably worth checking out commatoken but for me commatoken once was enough periodtoken","7179":"i saw that the hours had been expanded so decided to stop in one afternoon periodtoken theyve done a really great job remodeling the space theres tons of seating and the decor is really cute periodtoken however commatoken for the quality of the food commatoken the price was really steep periodtoken   the cheese fundido w chorizo was probably the best thing we ordered commatoken it was gooey and had lots of veggies but it was not worth 10 periodtoken   i also have a hard time paying 45 dollars for a single taco unless they are just great periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and these were not periodtoken although the tacos were hefty and filled well commatoken the lack of salt and lack of salsa selection left me unsatisfied periodtoken just not worth 5 periodtoken my boyfriend was also very underwhelmed with his selection of tacos commatoken although he mentioned he liked the idaho taco the best periodtoken   they did have a good local beer selection periodtoken you could tell the tortillas were fresh commatoken and the workers at the counter were really nice periodtoken  bottom line if youre going to gentrify tacos commatoken they need to have a lot more flavor periodtoken this place has lots of potential commatoken but the college crowd who lives in the area will not be interested in paying 15 for a set of bland tacos periodtoken","7182":"decent little spot to grab a quick bite periodtoken a bit overpriced commatoken but their cookies are amazing the juices arent that great commatoken ive tried several and they are all a bit off periodtoken no need to try and be overly inventive with flavors periodtoken kiss  keep it simple stupid periodtoken all in commatoken a good place if you have no time for lunch and dont want fast food periodtoken","7183":"went here on a monday with couple of friends for some drinks and small meals all the while also looking for a new monday spot periodtoken i ordered two appetizers and a glass of pomegranate juice periodtoken my total came to 25 whoa thats a little pricey for small plates periodtoken wings commatoken good crab cakes commatoken good cornbread fritters commatoken good shrimp tacos commatoken meh the texture was good commatoken however commatoken a whole shrimp is placed in middle of a taco shell periodtoken itll be so much better if they were at least chopped up so it spreads in the shell more periodtoken the coleslaw was bland commatoken not much flavor to it periodtoken overall commatoken the shrimp tacos just didnt cut it for us periodtoken i will not be ordering it in the future periodtoken our server was good commatoken but there were couple of times when he was nowhere to be found when we needed something periodtoken needless to say commatoken this wont be a regular monday spot ","7185":"my husband and i stopped to try big q over the weekend periodtoken the fried chicken and biscuits are really good the pulled pork was also very good periodtoken the sides left us wanting more though periodtoken they ran out if collard greens on a saturday at 5pm commatoken which was unfortunate periodtoken the mac and cheese was eh periodtoken and the fries were run of the mill periodtoken the portions are small for the price commatoken also periodtoken ill give it some time commatoken and try this place again in a few months periodtoken","7189":"the space is huge and inviting with reasonably comfy tables and chairs a nice upgrade from the truckee shop periodtoken lots of nice decorative details too commatoken like the mosaic lion on the wall periodtoken it looks like theyre still landscaping out back which should be a nice outdoor space in the spring periodtoken i shared a latte with the wife and thought it was great and fresh periodtoken kids hot chocolate for the kid was tasty enough periodtoken   the big ding was for a 6 periodtoken75 calzone made next door commatokeni believe that they reheated on the panini press periodtoken while the filling was tasty enough commatoken the reheating seared and slightly warmed a  chewy commatoken stale crust periodtoken this awful texture voided anything good going inside the thing periodtoken while the preassembled sandwiches seem to hold up to the refrigeration and reheating commatoken i would highly recommend coffeebar nix the reheated calzone idea it just doesnt work periodtoken","7191":"came here on a slow wednesday night commatoken but the place filled up fast periodtoken  i ordered sushi rolls and we had udon soup and salad periodtoken  i would say the sushi was slightly above averagenothing spectacular periodtoken  the udon was small for the price commatoken but was pretty good periodtoken  i dont understand the wild raves about this place commatoken but maybe i ordered the wrong thing periodtoken  its an average sushi spot commatoken as far as i can tell periodtoken","7192":"im not sure why this restaurant is rated so highly periodtoken  the food was average periodtoken i ordered a gyro and it had once slice of a tomato and barely any tzatziki sauce periodtoken  everyone in my group had the same experience with their gyros periodtoken  others in the group had average meals periodtoken  the best part of the meal was the salad periodtoken  spend your money as you see fit but ive found better food elsewhere periodtoken","7199":"ive been here and the burgers are okay periodtoken not bad but for the same price you could go to zinburger or cheesecake factory and get a better burger that isnt so greasy periodtoken the burgers are decent here though and the do have free peanuts periodtoken","7200":"this restaurant was simply ok periodtoken it got such rave reviews so perhaps my expectations were too high nonetheless everything about it was ok periodtoken let me tell ya why periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the ambiance was nice periodtoken the decor was modern and unpretentious periodtoken tables were spread far enough apart that you could enjoy a conversation without hearing your neighbor blab about her boyfriends snoring or her irritating mother in law periodtoken they are also able to accommodate large groups comfortably periodtoken   food was pretty good periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe problem the portions were tiny periodtoken they were like designer little meals with the matching price in a setting that would be more fit for upscale burgers and such periodtoken my 1 had the duck and she was not feeling it periodtoken i had the brisket which was delish periodtoken tiny but it tasted wonderful for dessert we had peach cobbler commatoken which was pretty good commatoken and the lemon pie thingy periodtoken our waiter raved about it so again i think i was expecting too much periodtoken it tasted like key lime pie periodtoken pretty good but nothing over the top periodtoken  service was spot on periodtoken our waiter was friendly and for the most part attentive periodtoken i really liked that he paid special attention to food allergies periodtoken its always a plus to walk out of the restaurant alive periodtoken   all in all the was a decent experience periodtoken i would likely not return just because there are so many other wonderful places to try in the area periodtoken if you decide to check it out get the brisket commatoken you wont be sorry periodtoken","7201":"i tried a small sample of the spumante secco at the tasting bar commatoken and liked it enough to buy a bottle for our group  but the bottle was flat periodtoken    the 10 music night included light appetizers which turned out to mean pretzels and crackers  i was expecting something a bit more substantial periodtoken  they did have pizza for sale commatoken  but it was nothing special periodtoken","7204":"overall a quality brewery periodtoken  service is quick and friendly periodtoken  food items are good commatoken but not outstanding commatoken and portions are large periodtoken  beers are cheap and good periodtoken  and thats what youre here for anyway commatoken right","7205":"um its decent periodtoken for 5 people got the rock crab special and spider crab which came with 5 clam chowders periodtoken   we love shellfish commatoken but this was not our favorite periodtoken just nothing special about it periodtoken simply put the place is overrated periodtoken  oh and they charge an automatic gratuity for live crab i know they charge a automatic gratuity for parties of 6 commatoken but nothing about the live crab periodtoken so heads up anyone who is going there for the first time periodtoken","7207":"expensive but fairly clean and convenient periodtoken i just started working next to them so itll be my goto for lunchessnacks when i forget to pack one or get too lazy to periodtoken i def wouldnt do all my grocery shopping here though periodtoken its ok periodtoken","7208":"reading the reviews makes me wonder if i went to the same place as the other reviewers periodtoken   i had reserved a table for one for 7 periodtoken30p this eve periodtoken upon arrival commatoken i was seated at the worst table in the house the one by the entrance commatoken in which the two seat options were either immediately behind the entry door commatoken which would hit me each time it swung open commatoken or on the opposite side of the table where the vent was blowing ferociously on me periodtoken i chose the latter as long as the waitress offered me the next open table periodtoken a deal was made commatoken and thankfully carried out right after the bread was served periodtoken   one waitress seemed to be catering to every table so it did take me a few minutes to receive my turn commatoken a rundown of the menu commatoken and the obligatory introductory bread periodtoken i opted for four pasta dishes commatoken explaining to her to leave out the seafood in any of them due to my allergy periodtoken   each came out quickly in succession commatoken as per request commatoken but the main carbonara dish came with the swordfish commatoken rather than without commatoken so i left much of it untouched periodtoken the rigatoni and gnocchi plates were solid the pesto pasta was rich on basil commatoken which was not to my liking commatoken but not the fault of the restaurant periodtoken  my waitress noticed the carbonara mishap and offered to bring me a new one commatoken but i was ready for dessert periodtoken i ordered the almond panna cotta commatoken which was this evenings highlight commatoken easily periodtoken light yet filling and with fruit to complement the airiness periodtoken  i was offered a complimentary zeppoli dish of doughnuts over nutella and did finish those commatoken which also did please the palate periodtoken  my three stars are for the table situation commatoken the quick and almost abrupt nature of the waitress in serving me no niceties or time to minglelinger commatoken and the cold commatoken cold dining room periodtoken seriously bring a parka periodtoken the food was overall presented well commatoken through i will likely never head to nj from philly for dinner again as its a far visit for a culinary scene that cannot compare to phillys periodtoken","7209":"nice but expensive i live in the chicago area so i know that goceris can be costly but this place was more than i normally pay periodtoken i had to stop in while visiting family to get some salad fixings since i that was my potluck dish to bring periodtoken  everything cost more than at home  lettuce commatoken tomatoes commatoken vinegar and herbs  the store is big and has lots of food to go options with sushi and a salad bar but the layout seems a bit awkward as i kept having grocery cart traffic jams i need many areas periodtoken  its nice but not worth the price","7210":"this is a nice place to sit down and have a cup of coffee commatoken a nice breakfast commatoken or one of their many pastries periodtoken  the decor is even nice enough to meet here for a lunch date periodtoken  the coffee is good periodtoken  i found the latte to be soso periodtoken  the cookies they have are great periodtoken  i cannot pass up the opportunity to have a chocolate chip or oatmeal cookie periodtoken  the oatmeal cookie is huge periodtoken  the chocolate chip cookie is unique with large chunks of chocolate chips periodtoken  one day i will stop through and try one of their breakfast entrees periodtoken","7211":"because of a groupon i finally got to try this place periodtoken i would like to give it 3 periodtoken5 stars but the rating system wont let me periodtoken i loved that they offered the jubilee nut brown ale periodtoken i also loved their unique taco creations periodtoken i went with 3 tacos recommended by the hostess periodtoken the tequila lime chicken commatoken fish commatoken and southern fried periodtoken the tequila lime was my favorite periodtoken a great combination of flavors periodtoken the southern fried my second favorite periodtoken the fish was average periodtoken the disappointment came from the tortillas on all of them periodtoken they were not even warmed up periodtoken they tasted so store boughtpackaged that it took away from the great flavors and tastes offered in the tacos periodtoken they say they are locally made so if they are they are the worse locally made tortillas periodtoken","7213":"we came as a huge family commatoken ordered lots of food 3orders of scallion pancake pretty good 3 orders of fried noodles some of the noodles are not fully cooked 1 order of fish congee  really good 1 order saut\u00e9ed spinach salty  2 order of fried rice alright 1 order of green bean with pork ok 2 order of spicy wonton they only gave us one commatoken decide to not go get it cuz is too far the rest is alright periodtoken they were at busy hour so the server is kind of mean commatoken and we ordered some drinks periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey were sweet and really powdery  and yea commatoken three star because most of the food are good but they forgot one order ","7215":"i think its garbage that they started making me wait in line for them to pump my coffee out of the thermos  and still makes me walk to the back of the store to pour my own milk periodtoken let us do it all ourselves like weve been doing for as long as i can remember or really make my coffee i do not like this system  it makes me late now and i wont be stopping in the morning any longer periodtoken other than that  if you dont have a job or arent in any sort of hurry commatoken go to buddy brew because the coffee is good","7218":"went there on thursday late in the  afternoon commatoken i was really looking forward to their sea urchin and rock crab commatoken unfortunately they were sold out periodtoken their next batch was not to come in from their fisherman until the evening at we know its fresh periodtoken settled for their scallop ceviche  it was a bit underwhelming commatoken flavor was a bit lacking periodtoken their clam chowder was really good periodtoken crab cakes were a bit subpar not enough crab chunks commatoken kinda doughy periodtoken i may return again the next time im up that way periodtoken will try to get there a bit earlier in the afternoon for availability of rock crab and sea urchin periodtoken i am really hoping the place can redeem itself the next time around periodtoken","7220":"solid periodtoken the best part about going to whaleys is the fact you just stopped at a roadside bbq smoke shack to get food periodtoken hell yeah periodtoken i have always wanted to try the ribs but i havent had the chance yet periodtoken i feel its very possible another star is in their future once i do periodtoken as for the pork sandwiches 5 for 10 bucks or 2 for 5 come on smoked on site commatoken soft buns commatoken and great homemade sauce commatoken what more do you want out of your roadside bbq stand if you find yourself hungry while riding out on 41 someday commatoken swing in and try it out","7221":"im always in the mood for sweets first time there though i was a little put off by the ordering systempicking from choices on a pad periodtoken you pick the donut commatoken topping etc not sure why you cant just place the order verballysaves time commatoken they say periodtoken after all that commatoken the actual donut was ok","7222":"3 stars because the bar staff was great periodtoken walked in and no one was at the hostess station to seat me so i went to the bar area periodtoken a friend recommended that i try the bread pudding but ive had better periodtoken the shrimp and grits was amazing i was under the weather and the bartender made me a hot toddy and was very attentive which made up for the lack of service upon my initial arrival periodtoken cant say i was impressed enough to return","7230":"im definitely not the target demo for this place commatoken because im not really the kind of guy who likes to spend ten bucks on a sandwichdrink combo periodtoken if im going to pay that much for a sandwich commatoken id rather go to a dedicated sandwich shop jersey mikes is usually my goto commatoken rather than pay the premium that comes with a cafe like this periodtoken  its hard to totally call the meal overpriced though commatoken since i actually really liked the food periodtoken i had the newks q sandwich bbq chicken commatoken and it was great periodtoken i subbed the chips for a pasta salad in an illfated attempt for a healthier option commatoken and that was a regrettable choice periodtoken but overall commatoken great food periodtoken  theres tons of seating commatoken and its a very open space commatoken so the atmosphere is nice periodtoken but in the end commatoken i just dont think its the place for me periodtoken id much rather get a better and bigger sandwich at jersey mikes for a couple dollars less periodtoken","7232":"ordered for pickup when i arrived order was ready periodtoken when i got home opened bag found wrong order had to go back and exchange order but also was charged for wrong order and was refunded difference periodtoken food is always good here this is the first time had issue with them","7241":"i took my kids and the line was pretty long periodtoken the cinnamon roll was a bit hard periodtoken and the toppings were not that great periodtoken i feel like the price for what you get is not that great of a value periodtoken i prefer cinnabon at the local mavricks periodtoken","7242":"a fuji apple chicken salad is made with more than lettuce commatoken tomato and dressing periodtoken maybe if the girl behind the counter would stop making eyes at the guy behind the counter with her i would not have had to ask for them to fix it periodtoken   3 stars is only for the fact that they made the salad again for me the right way periodtoken","7244":"not a bad place just a short walk from the ballpark periodtoken  they have a broad selection of beers and a small food menu periodtoken  i liked the chocolate milk stout quite a bit periodtoken  service was a little lacking compared to the other breweries that i visited periodtoken  im pretty sure that i could have fit the bartenders personality and helpfulness into a thimble periodtoken","7246":"culvers is just okay to me periodtoken  if you like buttered steaknshake patties and white castle fries then try culvers periodtoken","7247":"im waiting in line as we speak and by waiting i mean ive been in line for 20 minutes periodtoken we shall see if they get the order correct periodtoken","7249":"first by letting me say i am a starbucks addict i eat drink or work at some starbucks location almost every single day periodtoken this time i didnt go in but just grab myself some coffee in the drivethrough periodtoken this starbucks drivethrough is not necessarily ideal periodtoken you have to basically go through the line of fire from the drivethrough line to get to the front door if you decided you wanted to go inside instead of using the drivethrough periodtoken this location is also connected to body pages commatoken which periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken commatoken if you have some dry cleaning and want to grab a coffee is absolutely ideal however the layout for the drivethrough and parking for the guests that are going into the location is a bit dangerous and a bit muddled up periodtoken you have people there parking across the street that are trying to get into the entrance you have people from the drivethrough trying to get out of the drivethrough and into the drive through and all of them have to cross in the same general area periodtoken unfortunately this is the only drivethrough starbucks within quite some ways periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and if its snowing or raining and youre in a hurry this is going to be your best bet periodtoken the people here are always absolutely amazing commatoken like all starbucks so i give them three stars for the drivethrough but five stars for the staff periodtoken","7250":"my usual beer and pub food destination in wayne was too busy so we trekked on to ardmore as ive been wanting to try tired hands periodtoken  heard about the high craftsmanship and unique styles there and had high expectations periodtoken  arriving at the fermentaria commatoken we were greeted with a onehour waiting time periodtoken  having come this far commatoken we decided to stick it out periodtoken  we headed to the bar and perused the beer list periodtoken  finding that it is way heavily weighted toward pale ales and all kinds of fruity concoctions commatoken we ordered a couple of the tired hands saison periodtoken  not bad commatoken but definitely not what ive come to expect from a belgianstyle saison periodtoken  very sour on the finish commatoken lacking subtlety periodtoken  thinking that maybe i just dont have refined taste in their type of beers commatoken i tried two other varieties periodtoken  frankly commatoken they all tasted remotely similar commatoken as if they have limited range in their hops and brew styling periodtoken  we eventually got a seat at the bar tables commatoken noticing that several dining tables had remained vacant the entire time we were waiting periodtoken  ordered crispy pork belly buns not bad but pricey for two small buns commatoken and wife and i had crab and fish tacos respectively periodtoken  tacos were savory commatoken good blend of flavors and ample serving sizes periodtoken  asked the server if they brewed anything along the lines of a brown ale commatoken belgian dubbel or trippel commatoken stout commatoken etc etc etc periodtoken  she recommended yet another what turned out to be yeasty commatoken spicy commatoken citrusy beer periodtoken  it seems many beer enthusiasts are crazy about this place and their brews periodtoken ive seen the great ratings on their beers commatoken though i found that they are limited in their range periodtoken maybe my beer palate is not as refined as i thought but i would take victorys brew pub any time over this for variety commatoken depth and less radical artisan haughtiness than this brewery periodtoken","7251":"better than your average sandwich

periodtoken  we chose nectar cream and passionfruit periodtoken  now heres the thing  i like my flavors pronounced and bold as much as the next person commatoken but i was slightly disappointed with the somewhat artificial taste of the passionfruit syrup periodtoken  comparing it to another place my husband and i tried on our first day here commatoken this places homemade grapefruitbasil syrup paired with their version of the nectar cream felt more light and refreshing however because theirs did not have a second dousing of flavor commatoken the syrup didnt get a chance to drizzle their way towards the bottom before we gobbled it up periodtoken  in the end ultimately commatoken this place is clearly popular and youre not going to leave feeling unrefreshed periodtoken","7254":"great

would have no problem with the price commatoken but it was a premade biscuit just slightly larger then a silver dollar with very small scrawny piece of ham and microwaved periodtoken at 5 i had a butternut squashbacon egg pie slice of quiche which was also on the small side but tasted good periodtoken in all i am sure this would be a good alternate coffee stop commatoken but would not

periodtoken some are locally grown commatoken while others are imported from bc and the us periodtoken shelves are never empty and are always restocked with new produce because the turnover is so high periodtoken the majority of fruits and vegetables are fresh and crispy commatoken although they seem to go bad a lot faster than fruits and vegetables bought at commatoken lets say commatoken save on

commatoken the grandma pie and the brooklyn commatoken both of which have thick crust and fresh mozzarella commatoken are really good periodtoken  the greek salad is huge and always fresh  much better than most salads you get from a pizza joint periodtoken    i am deducting points for how frustrating their service is periodtoken i literally live on the same street as the business commatoken yet they have gotten lost multiple times trying to deliver to my house you dont even need to turn its the same road periodtoken  last time i went to pick up commatoken no one was at the register and i had

licked the plate of the lamb ragout that accompanied the pillowy light potato gnocchi commatoken and my husband reminisced about our own trips to italy with the grilled sardine appetizer her enjoyed periodtoken  but the dining experience here was dreadful periodtoken  my husband and i couldnt hear each other talk across the table commatoken so we just didnt talk through most of the meal commatoken which made us look like a couple on an awkward first date periodtoken  you dont have an assigned server commatoken instead commatoken the multiple servers in the dining room flit around like vultures waiting to snag an empty plate periodtoken  theres no warmth commatoken no friendliness commatoken no sicilian family feeling periodtoken  the gentleman at the table next to ours tipped our bread basket forward every time he leaned back in his chair commatoken but we left the basket there instead of switching it with the drinks on the other side periodtoken  as the evening wore on commatoken the restaurant became quite dark commatoken and some white commatoken bright table cloths would have gone a long way to add warmth and light to the place periodtoken  again commatoken if you are going for delicious food and ambiance is not a priority commatoken definitely go to zeppoli to enjoy the amazing food periodtoken  but after waiting a couple of months to snag a table commatoken we wanted a whole wonderful dining experience periodtoken  we definitely didnt get that periodtoken","7388":"we used to love their pizza but have been seriously disappointed lately periodtoken the last few pizzas weve ordered have been super doughy in the middle and undercooked to the point of being mushy think raw biscuit dough even when we ask for well done periodtoken when we take advantage of their carry out specials commatoken we end up putting the pizzas in our over at home to try to finish them off periodtoken i dont know where the disconnect is between asking for well done and getting underdone pizza commatoken but were now in the market for a new goto pizza option periodtoken","7393":"i happened upon this little bakery in oliver while waiting to meet with someone over at the mcdonalds and decided to pop in to see if they had hamburger buns in an attempt to save myself a trip over to safeway periodtoken   i got service immediately and was greeted by a very enthusiastic young woman periodtoken i did end up up purchasing a package based solely on the fact they smelt so darn good but was slightly shocked at the price periodtoken they are smaller than your typical grocery chain buns but the price jump obviously comes from the fact they are organic periodtoken  upon using them with our burgers however i was quite surprised with how much better they tasted then the prior mentioned grocery store chain buns so i must admit i am torn about my experience periodtoken if value and quantity is what is important to you then i recommend sticking with the big grocery stores but if you want something high quality and healthy and can handle paying a bit more these guys are a great choice periodtoken  i will definitely come back for a coffee and individual baked good if i am in the neighborhood again but i dont think my wallet could handle regular purchases here periodtoken","7394":"average is the best description for the corner cafe periodtoken the food is pretty average and the variety is also average periodtoken i had a cheese steak and cheese fries on one occasion and a bacon cheeseburger griller on another periodtoken the cheese steak was alright but the wiz on the fries was your basic salty cheese product periodtoken my second trip however commatoken the sourdough griller i had was actually pretty good periodtoken the service both times was ok and the atmosphere is fine periodtoken i feel like the owners are really trying to make it a good cafe in royersford periodtoken they just need some tweaking and alittle more effort periodtoken they could become a staple by diversifying the menu even more commatoken advertising in the community more commatoken and uping the service a bit periodtoken i wish the best of luck periodtoken an average place to eat and i recommend if you are looking for ok food for a decent price","7395":"since day one i have been in love with this place periodtoken my first experience with friends was delightful periodtoken i had the duck confit periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenvery salty but it was rich and satisfying periodtoken i absoultely fell in love with the dossaints periodtoken my only complaint is the past 2 times i stopped by just to pick up a dossaint they had ran out periodtoken i even called at 10a periodtokenm periodtoken to see if they had any and they ran out periodtoken mind you it was 10 a periodtokenm periodtoken i highly suggest they  have their inventory checked out before they lose more business periodtoken the eclectic mannerism doesnt help either periodtoken get with it people","7397":"i love a good burger and red robin makes a fairly good burger periodtoken but i have trouble giving a restaurant that serves its food in plastic baskets and charges 1012 dollars a meal more than 3 stars periodtoken   i ordered a burger with a special set of toppings and it came out exactly as ordered periodtoken my wife the vegetarian even was able to get a vegan burger made by boca with avacado and other toppings periodtoken the food was delivered almost to quickly periodtoken we were barely able to enjoy our drinks before they arrived periodtoken   overall we had a good experience and we just wanted something cheap and quick so it is a winner for that reason periodtoken","7401":"typical fast food americanized mexican periodtoken the young lady at the counter was very sweet and got our orders right periodtoken service with a smile commatoken she bid us a good day when we were leaving periodtoken   food came out fast and they got all the orders right periodtoken the womens bathroom was clean and well stocked as well periodtoken if i were in a pinch id go back to this location periodtoken","7407":"the place is nice commatoken the service was friendly and efficient and the owner is a pretty nice guy they dont serve food commatoken but had a food truck on site commatoken so sustenance is available if needed the beers were well made and free of off flavors commatoken but nothing wowed me although the el heffe was quite tasty definitely worth trying out commatoken plenty of house beers on tap commatoken and nice people working there if you like craft beer you should definitely stop by","7408":"i was disappointed periodtoken the man making my taco salad didnt know what pinto beans were periodtoken they charged me for a steak salad when i had a chicken salad periodtoken if that was a salad where was the lettuce  not likely to visit again periodtoken","7409":"this is a funky little place to eat periodtoken ive only had breakfast here commatoken and it was typical greasy diner food periodtoken they are known for their milkshakes commatoken but since ive never tried them i cant tell you how good or bad they are periodtoken some might call the decor of this place charming commatoken but i honestly dont know what to think of it periodtoken youll just have to decide for yourself periodtoken","7410":"im a bit surprised by the negative reviews so far periodtoken  maybe things have changed  ill keep this short and to the point periodtoken i went last week after realizing jakes was closed commatoken and still craving a burger periodtoken  i remembered that zacs took over for 5 guys commatoken so i figured id give it a shot periodtoken  i had a standard baconcheeseburger with extra cheese as well as an order of waffle fries periodtoken  the burger was good periodtoken  it wasnt jakesfive guys commatoken but it was close periodtoken  it was cooked properly commatoken tasted good commatoken and the bacon was cooked perfectly periodtoken   the waffle fries were real good periodtoken  they were the seasoned kind commatoken so less chickfila and more arbys curly fry flavor periodtoken    i didnt have a chance to try the milkshake commatoken but will next time periodtoken  heres the thing about zacs periodtoken  the burgers arent as good as jakes commatoken and the fries arent as good as five guys periodtoken  the fries are good commatoken the burgers are good just not as good as the more known establishments periodtoken  considering jakes is closed and 5 guys gone this makes a fine and serviceable replacement periodtoken    go in with moderate expectations and i think youll be pleased periodtoken  if youre going for the next jakes or five guys skip zacs and go to jakes or five guys periodtoken  if youre looking for a pretty good burger andor pretty good fries give zacs a shot periodtoken  dont believe all the negativity because its not bad periodtoken  form your own opinion commatoken but just give it a fair shot periodtoken","7411":"i was starving and stopped off at moes for some lunch periodtoken first time visitor to this chain periodtoken i had a chicken burrito bowl with black beans peppers cooked onions pico de gallo lettuce and cheese periodtoken tasty periodtoken liked the idea they included salsa and chips with any order periodtoken   whats really cool is their coke freestyle machine periodtoken it makes 106 flavors periodtoken nice concept periodtoken  the place is casual and fast periodtoken the ingredients tasted fresh and the price was reasonable periodtoken","7414":"our group of five stopped in for dinner before a local meeting periodtoken  we were seated immediately commatoken and the restaurant was not very busy periodtoken  our orders were taken promptly commatoken and our food was delivered fairly quickly periodtoken  the food was quite good commatoken and nobody had any complaints about their order periodtoken  the waitress was young commatoken but seemed to know what she was doing periodtoken  the prices for the meals were very reasonable commatoken and we left happy periodtoken  the only issue we encountered was during the paying of the bill periodtoken  if you want to split out individual meals commatoken make sure you say so before they produce the final ticket periodtoken  they dont have an easy ability to do so after the fact periodtoken  we will definitely be back periodtoken","7424":"i was pleasantly surprised by the good flavor of this pizza periodtoken while the prices are a little on the high side for chain pizza commatoken they regularly have coupons that run a decent deal periodtoken","7426":"second time here commatoken first review periodtoken had the bowl with chicken commatoken yellow rice and vegetable commatoken onions commatoken tomato periodtoken side of pollo bites and plantains periodtoken chicken was good but needed a little more seasoning periodtoken plantains were very good and the pollo bites seemed to have been frozen food not made on site periodtoken overall a good place for lunch commatoken floor was a little greasy when walking periodtoken i would come back periodtoken","7427":"first visit at this firehouse sub commatokenarrived at 330 commatokenordered my sub periodtokeni was only customer in there commatokenthere were three employees behind the counter there was not one table that was cleaned off commatokenfood on the floor commatokenlast time at that location","7431":"if you enjoy light lunches commatoken and are concerned about food truck mishaps  you can depend on the fishin chicken food truck to be a safe choice periodtoken  im not one to make safe choices commatoken though periodtoken the fishin chicken was near my workplace for lunch commatoken so i ordered the jerk chicken taco periodtoken the taco i gave it 3stars  it depends on what you want out of it periodtoken at the time commatoken i wanted some real jerk caribbean style periodtoken the jerk chicken wasnt truly authentic commatoken and ive done had the real stuff periodtoken but commatoken if youre an overall safe eater and want just a bit of flavor commatoken you can cheat knowing youve cheated on the healthiestcleanest version periodtoken  id still buy again from them periodtoken the service was great and they got orders out quick periodtoken","7436":"so i really wanted this place to rock our world but alas commatoken it falls short periodtoken  youre in the right ballpark commatoken b periodtokengood commatoken but execution is where you need work periodtoken    1st commatoken i dont want to be rushed while reading your board to order our lunch periodtoken  you guys may know whats up there by heart commatoken but we dont periodtoken  2nd commatoken im glad the food came out quickly commatoken but what the heck i just spent 30 and am still way hungry  3rd commatoken the buddha bowl concept is great with the local fresh produce commatoken but a little more dressing and more than 2 tablespoons of quinoa please  were going to chipotle for the main course i guess periodtoken   not returning","7441":"the food was alright periodtoken nothing to be excited about periodtoken it was filling and satified my taste buds but given the choice i would go else where periodtoken","7446":"it wasnt very crowded on a friday evening commatoken so i was able to sit at a high top with family periodtoken we ordered the tilapia special with orzo commatoken and the special burrito periodtoken the entrees and nacho app were nothing to really phone home about commatoken but their donuts are amazing periodtoken it doesnt hurt that there is also a bar inside periodtoken decor is nice commatoken and the waitstaff were polite and friendly periodtoken","7450":"the food was fantastic but the service was not so great periodtoken our server disappeared halfway through our meal periodtoken i told our server it was my boyfriends birthday when we arrived commatoken and he said he would make it special for him commatoken but we never saw him again periodtoken the food was great though commatoken i highly recommend the skillet tacos and natural margarita","7451":"everything is great about panda periodtoken i normally used to give 4 stars but im taking one off since they took forever to serve the food for me periodtoken i was the only person at that time standing in line to order commatoken the girl said she will be back in a sec but she turned up after 23 min and by that time the queue grew to 10 people periodtoken","7457":"since the new renovations the floor is lacking drink girls big time theres just not enough of them periodtoken the ones that do come around and take a drink order usually never come back i always tip no matter what periodtoken another thing several of the machines are out of order commatoken glitchy or completely gone some of the machines i like have been moved or theyre gone forever  just when i find some i like they get moved or theyre broken periodtoken as far as the hotel rooms go commatoken theyre nice but overpriced big time periodtoken good things for comps or id never stay and play periodtoken","7459":"oysters very good commatoken raw and baked commatoken but service was very slow and not very customer friendly periodtoken waitress was awful and not sure she really wanted to serve our 10 top periodtoken food was ok but dont think ill ever return periodtoken","7462":"mediocre periodtoken the staff isnt super great either periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenseems like a bunch of angry hipsters versus friendly hipsters","7463":"my go to wawa periodtoken  well stocked and you can gas up periodtoken    interesting clientele ranging from upscale to the homeless periodtoken  staff ranges from very friendly and helpful to distracted and zoned out periodtoken  parking lot can be a bit of a free for all if you hit it at peak hours periodtoken","7470":"to be truthful commatoken ive had better pizza periodtoken i felt that the italian dinners were skimpy but ok for the prices periodtoken the food wasnt bad periodtoken","7471":"this is an acceptable place to get frozen custard if you are closer to mr periodtoken wizards than to ted drewes periodtoken  the frozen custard and concretes are not as good or as consistent as ted drewes periodtoken  for example commatoken if you get something such as a reeses peanut butter cup concrete commatoken the mixin is distributed in a very uneven manner periodtoken  by the time you get to the bottom third of the concrete there wont be any more of the mixin commatoken it will only be frozen custard periodtoken  one other note  mr periodtoken wizards has a sign stating that they wont take credit cards below a specific dollar amount periodtoken  why is this  its not like the dollar amount of the transaction changes the interchange fee percentage periodtoken  also commatoken this policy is in violation of their agreements with the credit card companies periodtoken","7475":"the name of this place sounded quite inviting periodtoken located close to several airline gates commatoken ideal for getting a quick sandwich before boarding the plane periodtoken  stick with the premade wraps or salads if you are in a hurry commatoken the sandwiches can take upwards of 20 minutes for them to make periodtoken  the 5 cheesecake scoop was average in taste commatoken little bit larger than a golf ball periodtoken way too sweet for someone used to new york style cheese cake periodtoken consistency was of a thick vanilla pudding periodtoken the basic cheesecake mix is then garnished with different toppings caramelized nuts commatoken chocolate chips commatoken oreo cookies  to make the other flavors available on the menu periodtoken you may want to stick to the plain cheesecake as the toppings bring even more sugar and make the already too sweet cheesecake into a sugar rush periodtoken my sandwich was ok but after eating about half of it commatoken was disappointed to find a hair in it see photo at which point i lost my appetite periodtoken next time i will check the sandwich before boarding the plane periodtoken","7479":"hospitality was great food was ok commatoken i ordered the fettuccine alfredo commatoken it wasnt good commatoken i dont know what it was about it but but sauce was just gross commatoken i dont know how you mess up alfredo sauce but it wasnt good periodtoken the pizza rolls were great and i loved them but the alfredo just wasnt good periodtoken good service though","7484":"i tend to be more of a coffee purist and im not a chai guy commatoken so i really come here because its popular with the crowd periodtoken  the coffee is good middle of the pack in this neighbourhood and the food smells great commatoken but i guess i dont thing of it as a restaurant and generally im not there at meal times periodtoken  our typical time at remedy is spent talking over a coffee commatoken beer or chai periodtoken  its got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby sugar bowl and id say a more bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street periodtoken  its more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings periodtoken  this end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot periodtoken  there are a couple of sushi spots commatoken a couple of diners commatoken a couple of espresso cafes commatoken a really decent pho place commatoken and with sugar bowl and remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee along with indian food before popping into the garneau for some art house periodtoken","7485":"terrific food and beer periodtoken awful service periodtoken you could eat the beer cheese dip and bread as a meal periodtoken its delightful periodtoken the sprecher cherry cola that they offer is almost as good as their beer periodtoken its very crowded when the weather is nice because its right off the monon periodtoken","7486":"i finally gave this place a chance during my last visit commatoken having seen what appeared to be better reviews periodtoken their case was full of fresh baked good but i was in the mood for cowboy periodtoken it wasnt bad but it wasnt superb periodtoken it probably would have awesome were it not for the slow service that may have made it cold periodtoken","7490":"first the good beautiful interior periodtoken great beer and drinks periodtoken good separation of the bar from the dining room periodtoken now the bad poor value for dollar spent periodtoken french onion soup commatoken one of my favorites for evaluation commatoken super salty commatoken thin broth with two tiny slivers of onion not even up to campbell soup quality periodtoken fries mealy and barely warm periodtoken sandwiches thin and needing more meat periodtoken kitchen slow and server kept forgetting items ordered periodtoken kids meals only thing somewhat on point but even they said fries were iffy periodtoken on first visit we always order from the middle of the menu and we were glad not to waste too much money periodtoken i suggest the manager actually try the food for freshness and quality periodtoken might open their eyes periodtoken otherwise a good spot for meeting and drinking periodtoken eat elsewhere periodtoken just a side note periodtoken while waiting for our food the couple next to us called the manager over and told him the food was terrible periodtoken this was midmeal periodtoken one of them paid and just left periodtoken should have been our heads up of what was coming periodtoken","7492":"salmon was fresh periodtoken the hotpot with fish eggs was not good periodtoken pho noodle soup was terrible periodtoken melons were not fresh  periodtoken if u like shabu shabu commatoken the dinner will work for you periodtoken otherwise try 11 lunch periodtoken","7496":"donuts were pretty good not amazing periodtoken not as amazing for all the hype periodtoken i did not really enjoy the 2 that i had periodtoken i guess im more of a traditional kind of donut eater and this is not traditional at all periodtoken im not from st louis and am in town on business and so i was picking up a dozen periodtoken all the guys in the office enjoyed them so thats what mattered periodtoken","7499":"it was fine commatoken but i found it did not live up to the hype periodtoken i had the georgia peach pancakes commatoken and it was good commatoken but not life changing periodtoken it was nice to do for the experience and to see what the hypes about commatoken but not a mustdo periodtoken","7501":"first off lets get the positive points through periodtoken  good pizza commatoken fresh ingredients and good portions periodtoken  the salads are great as well periodtoken  service is pretty good too periodtoken  they accidentally brought me a medium pizza when i ordered a large made up for it by bringing me a second medium for free periodtoken  my main beef with this joint can be summed in one word flies periodtoken  been there 3 times in the last 6 months or so and there are always an abundance of nasty flies commatoken everywhere periodtoken  but theyre good people with good food","7504":"reality set in for me periodtoken came back to earth commatoken good for a brew pub commatoken but still a brew pub periodtoken   last visit was ok to good periodtoken food was good enough commatoken maybe a little flat periodtoken service was more the issue commatoken certainly ok but not attentive periodtoken some long waits to find server and we needed her periodtoken plus starting out was a little rough commatoken longer wait than expected periodtoken   tried again last night commatoken noisy and crowded commatoken no patio seating periodtoken went elsewhere periodtoken inside was a little rough from all the previous activity periodtoken plus always freezing cold inside periodtoken inside isnt for us periodtoken   every bit of 3 stars commatoken just not more periodtoken","7506":"the highs  prompt service commatoken food delivered fast and hot periodtoken  great pancakes and large portions periodtoken  solid blueplate breakfast periodtoken the lows  the coffee periodtoken  drip generic blah periodtoken  nothing fancy  the bacon was limp commatoken thin and generic periodtoken  food was probably sysco commatoken straight out of the truck except for the pancakes periodtoken  however commatoken for the portions commatoken the price was right and nothing was belowpar by any stretch of the imagination except for the coffee periodtoken   recommended  go for the pancakes commatoken the bloody marys and bring your cafeaulait with you periodtoken","7511":"i love the archiecture more then anything periodtoken it was a very impressive place to be periodtoken at the end you were given two free beverages periodtoken i went with the pumpkin and stella periodtoken   what else can be said about a brewery tour periodtoken you do have the option to choose between the fast tour commatoken which routes you to the beer samples right away commatoken or the extended which takes you along the streets and into several buildings for a more detailed tour periodtoken   go on the extended your first time commatoken from then on out skip to the fast routed tour periodtoken","7517":"nickie the server was absolutely amazing and professional loved the surf and turf special she offered i have to agree that the sushi is absolutely scrumptious commatoken fulfilling and the portion size is great the reason im giving it a 3 star is due to the fact of the unprofessionalism and disrespect of a kitchen staff that was visible to the front of the bar periodtoken i believe his name is felipe and commatoken clearly he didnt know i spoke spanish but commatoken everything coming out of his mouth was ruining our experience periodtoken","7521":"i have to agree that the place has slipped periodtoken ive been in a few times as i dont want an off day to hurt the stores rating periodtoken they have reduced the amount of varieties and the finishes are just not as good periodtoken   as i said i was in a few times but this past sunday was the last straw periodtoken i know its mothers day so i called ahead to ask if i needed to place an order for my donuts periodtoken they said no just come early periodtoken i was there at 8am and they were out of glazed donuts and had very limited selection periodtoken i asked the owner the very nice asian lady and she said her husband did not make extra donuts for mothers day just the normal amount periodtoken if anyone thinks 8am was late thats because i went to paoli first and they were out already periodtoken they have good donuts and bagels but please get your act together or just hire someone from dunkin donuts to teach you how to project your orders periodtoken oh yeah i know this because thats where i ended up getting my donuts from periodtoken they had plenty of donuts and even had heart shaped donuts with sprinkles for mothers day periodtoken","7524":"service not great and food feels very rushed periodtoken overall just okay periodtoken","7525":"i came here on a free saturday afternoon commatoken and they were fairly busy periodtoken but i was helped almost immediately commatoken they had a very small selection commatoken but i probably shouldve gotten there earlier in the day periodtoken the layout of this place is weird commatoken theres a case of macaroons in the center periodtoken all the sweets laid out all looked very cute commatoken but i went there on a macaroon hunt periodtoken i got a case of 6 commatoken a variety of flavors periodtoken their boxes are cute periodtoken i will say their wait staff is really stuck up periodtoken the guy helping me did not seem like i was the type of person he wanted to wait on periodtoken i also got some home made marshmallows commatoken and it cost me 17 periodtoken so the people are rude and its expensive periodtoken its very cute though and my macaroons were tasty periodtoken","7530":"great bagels in the area periodtoken its not an easy task these days finding a great bagel periodtoken here the bagels are great and fresh periodtoken they offer a great variety of favors periodtoken the only challenge i have is the service to me is slow and it is cold and unfriendly periodtokenvzc","7531":"my family and i used to be huge fans of don pablos we would probably go at least once per week commatoken but we were converted by on the border periodtoken i can definitely say that on the border is the best local place for mexican periodtoken their food is consistently good commatoken and i dont think theyve ever messed up an order of mine periodtoken the only downside is that the service here can be incredibly slow periodtoken ive had several trips to on the border where my waiter only came to my table three times when we ordered commatoken when he brought out our food commatoken and to give us the check periodtoken while the food is great commatoken the service definitely leaves something to be desired periodtoken","7532":"it is difficult not to like this place periodtoken some welltraveled friends recommended it to us when we were in the area periodtoken the setting is romantic and friendly periodtoken the food was not memorable commatoken but i would give it a second chance periodtoken","7533":"so far of all the beer i have tasted at the nola breweries this brewery has the best to my taste periodtoken  the space is pretty cool being in an old movie theater while the geographic location can be a bit on the shady side and challenging to find if you dont know where you are going periodtoken  the kristalweizen and scotch ale were my top choices and i would enjoy drinking mass quantities of those periodtoken  the space is set up much more like a bar than a lot of the other spots with indoor bench seating like a german biergarten but no outside patio seating periodtoken  they also have some random food pop ups periodtoken    beer prices start at 5 and go up from there which i found pretty pricey for a beer in this locale even if it is some craft fancy stuff it is still just beer in the end and i would drink a lot more of it at 4 than at 5 periodtoken  maybe give locals and beer professionals that commit to 6 or more beers a quantity discount  maybe sell in a proper bavarian liter glass for a better quantity and discount for those dedicated to the beer consumption arts","7535":"enjoyed the sushi i had the lunch special with 2 rolls florida and spicy salmon commatoken soup commatoken and salad periodtoken  personally i would prefer it cost less and only get soup or salad periodtoken  also had a spicy tuna roll periodtoken  disappointments  they dont have hot green tea periodtoken   part of their philosophy is sustainabilityimpact on the environment so im confused why they are using plastic disposable cups for soy sauce commatoken disposable chop sticks commatoken and bottled drinkssoda periodtoken  most of the bottles were glass so pretty easy to recycle but i wonder if they really are recycling periodtoken  bottom line would i go back  yes if im in the immediate area periodtoken  but i dont think i would make a trip out to go there specifically periodtoken","7537":"best beer and brewery in indy periodtoken sadly loses huge points for lack luster service periodtoken ive been numerous times and they are quick to get rid of you periodtoken met one of their brewers once and the guy was awesome and showed me a lot periodtoken this place would be the best if the servers were happier and better at customer service periodtoken","7541":"insider tip commatoken this location of noodles has the availability to make buffalo mac  cheese commatoken and off the menu item periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i just went for lunch today commatoken it is delicious","7542":"the service was great but the juice only comes in a medium cup i watched one gal throw away the rest commatoken she couldnt give the rest to me in the large cup periodtoken no commatoken the rest was not foam there was still lots of juice periodtoken i could go to tree city and get a large for the exact same price commatoken dont think ill be back anytime soon periodtoken","7544":"i love coming here for thanksgiving bc their stuffed turducken is so darn delicious periodtoken the only downside is that their products are pricey periodtoken last time i brought a turducken was 7080 periodtoken that was a few years ago periodtoken","7548":"bob was a great tour guide periodtoken but i definitely expected more food for the food tour periodtoken when they say sample size they mean it periodtoken i was hoping for at least a small appetizer size portion commatoken in actualitiy you get a sauce size portion periodtoken  dont go on the tour hungry periodtoken","7549":"good standard for the nola

commatoken but the last time i was there commatoken i saw a bug crawling on the countertop periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken ewwww periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  may switch back to cafe du monde drive thru periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","7556":"let me start by saying i love donuts periodtoken every city i travel to i find the local spot to indulge periodtoken periodtoken and i thought district donuts would be appropriate periodtoken donuts looked good and the local vibe of the shop was appealing periodtoken   i ordered a variety of donuts periodtoken periodtoken and was disappointed to find that all of them lacked flavor periodtoken it was hard to tell which donut was a certain flavor because they all appeared bland and boring periodtoken i would say the wedding cake donut was my favorite because the texture somewhat resembles a wedding cake periodtoken   the coffee here really stole the show periodtoken i would return for an iced coffee periodtoken periodtoken but not a donut periodtoken","7558":"i was in town visiting my bff who has moved there recently and we wanted sushi commatoken so dammit commatoken we got sushi periodtoken   ru sans showed us a great time commatoken especially since we were in the mood to partay bday extravaganza followed our lovely dinner periodtoken every time and i mean every time someone orders a sake bomb they do the

fine commatoken we can chat later periodtoken haha periodtoken sake bombs  as far as the food commatoken it was good periodtoken nothing to write home about commatoken but good periodtoken my bff did get an obscure roll  i cant remember the name of it for the life of me but it looked like five rolls commatoken stuck together in the shape of a flower commatoken were deep fried toget and then cut off as large commatoken flower shaped slices periodtoken it was weird periodtoken and impossible to eat periodtoken and just weird periodtoken   the service was good commatoken again commatoken nothing spectacular or memorable periodtoken price was reasonable for the 4 people we had eating there periodtoken   all in all commatoken an aok experience periodtoken","7559":"you know when someone tries to do so many things that they cant really do any of them well thats exactly how i feel about cafe square one periodtoken   their menu is super extensive and they boast that you can pretty much make any accommodation you wish commatoken which is nice for those picky souls periodtoken ive had an array of items here from salads to bagels and i wasnt very impressed with any of them periodtoken service is friendly commatoken but very slow commatoken even when youre the only customer periodtoken   the smoothies are a solid 4stars though and i will certainly return for those periodtoken","7560":"ive been to bullys before and the food was wonderful commatoken but tonight was just poor periodtoken  first commatoken they were out of rribs and slaw rreally at 730 on a saturday night  they were out of pork steaks and hush puppies as well   hard to believe they would be out of food this early in the evening periodtoken  we ordered the pulled pork plate periodtoken  it came out cold  the pork was room temperature at best periodtoken  fried corn was watery and mealy flavor periodtoken  broccoli was warm commatoken not hot periodtoken  fries and sweet potatoes were hot and tasty periodtoken  overall the meal sucked periodtoken  we did get one meal removed from the bill when we finally got to talk with our waitress periodtoken  they were very busy so unfortunately we rarely saw our server periodtoken","7561":"people rave about this place and the dan dan noodles periodtoken they proudly display a banner that says cnn rated one of the top 50 chinese restaurants in the us periodtoken i guess maybe the flagship location is manayunk which could be better than exton periodtoken ive been to exton and royersford several times and it does not impress me like i hoped it would periodtoken i keep going back though hoping things will turn around periodtoken i should probably mention i lived in two different cities in china for over 6 months each and have a good understanding of authentic cuisine periodtoken the dan dan noodles just do not do it for me periodtoken i think people rave about them because no other chinese restaurant around has a dish like this commatoken so maybe it is new to them the dumplings are good commatoken but totally not authentic at all periodtoken and most recently i was here and the menu seemed a bit different periodtoken the entrees was just a list of maybe 12  16 different styles of food which i thought was a very odd way to present your menu periodtoken if you do decide to go commatoken you should definitely try the eggplant periodtoken this was good enough to make me want to come back again and get that with something new periodtoken","7563":"decent wine and beer selection and friendly staff for the quick bottle or six pack  but i usually make the trip to joe canals if we are entertaining a big group periodtoken","7566":"our first clue that things were going to be alright here was the influx of many asians coming to dinner periodtoken you know it makes you feel better to see that periodtoken it was nice to find a decent vietnamese place in indy while in town for work periodtoken the bun bo hue beef noodle soup was savory and a little spicy commatoken the pho was fine commatoken but the goi ga shredded chicken and cabbage salad was just swimming in nuoc mam commatoken when it really should just be lightly flavored with it periodtoken otherwise commatoken the decor was nice commatoken the service was fine commatoken and there was even some funny people watching periodtoken there was a nonasian family celebrating the wifemoms birthday and the husband was explaining loudly to the table that saigon was a city in vietnamese commatoken then proceeded to explain this to the vietnamese server as well thankyou commatoken clueless guy commatoken for the show with my dinner","7572":"ive never been a beer drinker commatoken but i am a dork and i like to know how things work periodtoken  this is why i went ahead and did the ab tour when i had some friends in town periodtoken  it was really interesting to see how the brewery has grown over the years and how they actually go about making the beer periodtoken  this is a good thing to do when you have outoftown visitors periodtoken  its also nice not for me commatoken but for people who like beer that you get 2 free samples at the end of the tour periodtoken  my friends husband was especially happy about that since he got my free samples","7574":"this place is aok periodtoken nothing spectacular to add periodtoken quick regular sandwich commatoken and able to use the wifi from the place next door periodtoken not much business when i was here commatoken so i was able to chill at a booth for a while periodtoken","7576":"wow commatoken this is crazy commatoken indulgent commatoken greasy commatoken hangoverapproved food periodtoken i think i got the humpty dumpty burger commatoken which was literally loaded with everything and anything commatoken including a drippy egg on top periodtoken it was good commatoken but the simple burger with lettuce and tomato that my boyfriend had was nothing special periodtoken it was especially disappointing because of the pretty penny he paid for it periodtoken   in conclusion commatoken it seems like the special burgers are the way to go to get a good deal at 500 degrees periodtoken i wouldnt even bother with the fries since they are around 4 each and super overseasoned commatoken imo periodtoken","7578":"i gotta settle on the same stores periodtoken i have to have written more reviews for grocery stores than any yelper this is a newer publix periodtoken the deli line moved quickly periodtoken they had all the brands i was looking for periodtoken the selection is vast  there is a good assortment periodtoken produce was fresh periodtoken staff was friendly  helpful periodtoken  checkout lines were not long commatoken yeah periodtoken cashier was friendly periodtoken nut what is up periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they dont offer to take your groceries to your car anymore that stinks periodtoken whats a girl to do i gotta lug them upstairs commatoken guess i am supposed to lug them out of the store periodtoken","7579":"3 periodtoken5 stars   the decor was nice and the guy that helped me out as really friendly periodtoken i saw some fruit flies in the far left muffin case and was a bit turned off about getting anything in there  their creme brulee truffle was really good and melts in your mouth periodtoken  i really like the almond wedding cupcake periodtoken i didnt care much for the frosting commatoken but the cake was delicious one of my favorites periodtoken  their red velvet was aok periodtoken ive had way better periodtoken i wouldnt recommend it periodtoken","7581":"the coffee is good commatoken but over priced periodtoken super convenient location which is probably what you are paying for periodtoken we got our coffee in to go cups when we did not ask for them and it was not much coffee in the cup periodtoken the big room is renovated and has some cool elements commatoken but is missing the cozy feel that coffee shops beckon periodtoken staff was not very enticing either periodtoken","7582":"braised pork rice  favorite dish of the night commatoken highly recommended periodtoken i would say its above average periodtoken i would have given 2 stars if not for this dish periodtoken  oyster omelette  first time trying this commatoken it tastes pretty much exactly like how its sound periodtoken i wouldnt get it again periodtoken too much red sauce it was watered down ketchup or something  zha jia mian  it was just meh periodtoken i wouldnt get again periodtoken   pork blood commatoken pork stomach commatoken tofu dish on the chinese menu bottom left  it was just okay commatoken the flavor was a bit strong commatoken i wouldnt get again periodtoken  stinky tofu  first time trying it commatoken didnt like this kind of fried tofu","7587":"sadly this place is unimpressive periodtoken i came here craving oatmeal periodtoken so i ordered oatmeal and sausage periodtoken the oatmeal can in s dry block periodtoken it had yogurt and berries on top periodtoken it dry and unpleasant periodtoken the sausage was very good periodtoken it taste fresh periodtoken i can only give this place 3 stars because it wasnt impressive periodtoken  im open to giving it another try on day periodtoken maybe oatmeal isnt their thing periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","7588":"server wasnt friendly and didnt explain salsa choices to us periodtoken food was average nothing out of this world periodtoken i did like how they had whole wheat tortilla options for a healthier choice periodtoken guac was average chips were light and nothing felt super heavy which was a plus periodtoken","7589":"we went here on a sunday evening at 820 periodtoken they gave us seating outside and informed that their kitchen closes at 9 periodtoken we were ready to order everything by 825pm periodtoken no one came to ask for water or take order periodtoken there was one waitress outside service other 4 tables but kept smiling at us and did not stop by periodtoken finally at 845 i called inside and requested to be served periodtoken so commatoken finally someone came outside to help us with water and get us wine glasses periodtoken so our first experience was not that good periodtoken  the only reason why this place gets 3 stars os because the food was very good and tasty periodtoken the place is also byob with no corkage fees periodtoken they give free chips n salsa periodtoken salsa was descent too periodtoken although our chips took 45 mins to arrive and came with our apps instead of upfront periodtoken for food we ordered their friend banana with beef and chicken with saffrin rice for entrees periodtoken recommend this place for food but be prepared for lowsy service periodtoken note dont forget to try their deablo sauce periodtoken a little goes a long way periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","7592":"aside from being sparkling new commatoken what really distinguishes noboru from the more well known sushi buffet in the suburban philly area minado is the selection of korean dishes periodtoken  you can get a made to order stew i periodtokene periodtoken korean seafood tofu periodtoken  the person behind the counter will give you a number and when its ready commatoken a server will deliver it to your table periodtoken  the salmon skin pressed sushi triangle was delicious periodtoken  the wings in the hot foods section was also pretty good periodtoken  i will agree commatoken that the sushi selection seemed limited in comparison to minado commatoken but i thought it was of the same quality periodtoken sushi was aok and sushi rice was not hard periodtoken  in the states commatoken buffet sushi is hardly ever going to be spectacular periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken thats just the truth   lunch on weekends is about 17person commatoken a fair price periodtoken    will be back to try the shabushabu offered at dinner time periodtoken","7594":"good food commatoken pretty greasy commatoken but surprisingly expensive periodtoken 16 for a standard cheeseburger fries and drink","7603":"overall experience ok chicken dry but beer cheese soup good wife loves portabello sandwich staff very friendly but kept thinking to myself i just paid premium price for chicken that mcdonalds could have done better with periodtoken also no tomatoes available because they grow their own well if weather is in season where you cant grow them how about running down to the restaurant depot and getting some","7604":"we went to crabby bills on our first trip here and had a great conversation with the waitress periodtoken  she was a transplant from new hampshire and a swimmer so had an interest in common with one of my daughters periodtoken  this cbs is right across from the beach there is another at the marina which we went to as well following our fishing excursion periodtoken  there they prepared our catch from a fishing excursion have posted picture periodtoken  both cbs are comfortable beach side restaurants periodtoken  nothing overly fantastic or incredibly disappointing periodtoken  that said commatoken i could see myself visiting again on my next trip periodtoken","7605":"we stayed here for my birthday one year periodtoken  over priced and over rated  the room was nice commatoken but not worth 250 night periodtoken  at that price commatoken everything in the room and mini fridge should have been included periodtoken  even if you take the items out of the fridge and put it back commatoken it charges you periodtoken  make sure to let the hotel staff know about the items you didnt consume periodtoken i also left with a few bug bites the next day periodtoken  i know they allow pets in their rooms commatoken so i dont know if fleas were the culprit periodtoken  the casino was fun commatoken but of course expensive as expected periodtoken  i would return to the casino and restaurants commatoken but i will not stay in the hotel again periodtoken","7607":"today was our first visit periodtoken the food was good and the server was very nice periodtoken the only unpleasantness was from the order taker periodtoken we found her to be curt and dismissive periodtoken well give it another go periodtoken","7610":"ive only had one experience with this place commatoken and i want impressed commatoken though my wife enjoyed her breakfast periodtoken she had the beni commatoken eggs benedict periodtoken  i think beyond bread has far superior pastries just across the street kouing aman is amazing periodtoken  cronut was sub par commatoken and cant remember the other food i had because it wasnt very memorable periodtoken  i really wanted to like this place commatoken baked goods are my favorite periodtoken  i do plan to give it another shot commatoken and will update my review if my opinion changes periodtoken","7611":"ordered a miso praline and olive oil donut and it was delicious it just didnt taste like miso or olive oil periodtoken there was bacon on it which pretty much overpowered the flavor periodtoken but it was still one of the best donuts ive had fluffy and not overly greasy commatoken considering the increase in gourmet donut shops in los angeles periodtoken   also got a 12 oz periodtoken cold brew commatoken which wasnt very acidic commatoken but the flavor wasnt smooth for my liking periodtoken total for the two was 6 periodtoken i would still recommend to give district a try periodtoken","7613":"did lunch special periodtoken good commatoken not great periodtoken  should have opted for a more traditional dish off of the main menu periodtoken egg rolls  sweet  sour sauce were very good periodtoken","7614":"the sushi here is pretty solid commatoken albeit a little too pricey for my liking periodtoken i tend to go here if i plan on eating in the restaurant or when i have a particular craving for spicy scallop rolls which they do quite well periodtoken the staff is friendly and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated periodtoken i just wish the prices were a tad lower for lunch ive spent 16 on a lunch here commatoken a lot higher than id pay other places periodtoken","7617":"decided to give this place a try as we love supporting local businesses that are eco friendly periodtoken so it makes me sad to report that we most likely wont be going back periodtoken the food was good but a couple of the waitresses just dont look happy to be there and we didnt get one smile from either of them the entire time periodtoken ive been a waitress commatoken i understand it can be a tough job and maybe not what you want to be doing on a sunday but customer service still really matters periodtoken there was a guy there who was really nice and friendly but unfortunately the 2 women bring down the vibe of the place periodtoken sad because i really wanted to like it periodtoken its a very cute commatoken cozy place with antique looking toys for kids and a good menu commatoken but like i said commatoken it just didnt vibe for us periodtoken definitely worth giving it a try and hopefully youll have a different experience","7621":"i hover between aok and i am a fan for the following reasons commatoken i am old commatoken i like to sit down and i dont want too much noise periodtoken  fortunately we were early on a weeknight and got a booth commatoken some nice food commatoken a whole side of a clash album had not heard that album in a while so sang along gaily periodtoken  on a weekend i fear my old bones would crumble with the crush in here periodtoken  methinks the big old fire chamber or shmelter or whatever it was  would have to become my personal vip spot periodtoken cocktails as always excellently crafted by the owners periodtoken prices are to be expected to be in line for this brooklyn cool people keep wittering about periodtoken a good addition to the scene but not for date night periodtoken","7622":"i got crepes here a couple days ago and i wasnt impressed periodtoken the only place ive ever bought crepes before was at the bellagio in las vegas so maybe my expectations are high periodtoken periodtokeni ordered them to go and by the time i got to my car 2 minute walk the crepes were cold periodtoken they werent very soft and didnt taste that great periodtoken i couldve made better ones at home periodtoken   on that note commatoken their gelato is delicious periodtoken so commatoken if youre going there commatoken try the gelato","7624":"convenient for essentials like milk commatoken bread commatoken and eggs since im a block away but other than that commatoken its just an overpriced and overrated haven for people who will actually pay 8 for a jar of tomato sauce because it has an organic label smacked on it periodtoken  its tomato sauce periodtoken    i always find myself settling for the cheapest thing because the prices are so high periodtoken  ive never had a problem with any of the products ive purchased commatoken except for the one time i thought i bought shredded cheese it was the cheapest on the rack  4 commatoken which is still ridiculous only to go home and discover its fake commatoken imitation cheese commatoken most likely made of soy periodtoken  i put it on my tacos and it tasted okay commatoken but when i tried to make nacho cheese out of it by melting it in the microwave commatoken it solidified into a hard commatoken gooey ball of orange periodtoken  cheese shouldnt do that periodtoken  word to the wise unlike me commatoken read the labels carefully before you buy something vegan when you dont want vegan periodtoken   the store itself is way too crowded and the aisles leave you hardly any room to stop your cart and peruse the selections periodtoken  for some reason commatoken every time i go there commatoken about nine workers are roaming the aisles with handtrucks commatoken unloading boxes right where i need to be periodtoken  if shoprite were closer commatoken id go there instead periodtoken  on the plus side the daily meal deals in the deli section are actually really worth it periodtoken you get a decent sized entree and two sides from a wide variety of healthy and fresh options commatoken depending on the day periodtoken it varies from 6 poultry to 8 pasta or beef  to 10 fish periodtoken  the london broil is really good and the balsamic chicken is cooked perfectly periodtoken  plus commatoken you cant go wrong with any of the sides periodtoken","7629":"stopped by for dinner during a weekend trip to philly from nyc periodtoken walked in on a sat night without a reservation commatoken and the wait was 2 hours long for a party of 4 periodtoken my friends and i managed to get seats at the bar commatoken so we just ordered food and beer at the bar instead of waiting 2 hours for a table periodtoken the atmosphere is trendy  the bar area is very long and spacious commatoken but it eventually got really crowded through the evening periodtoken i noticed there were maybe only 1520 dining tables towards the back of the restaurant  goodluck getting seated at a table  honey whiskey wings  the sauce was sweet commatoken but thats pretty much it periodtoken there was no depth in flavor commatoken cant really taste any whiskey in the sauce  nothing too special in my opinion periodtoken  mussels in manhattan clam chowder  yummy i wanted to soak every last drop of the chowder with bread periodtoken the mussels also had good flavor periodtoken disco fries  i really wanted to like this dish periodtoken handcut fries with peas commatoken ham commatoken chucky cheese sauce and top with a perfectly poached egg periodtoken it sounded and looked amazing commatoken but i found the fries too soggy  really greasy periodtoken the sauce was bland periodtoken it definitely sounded better than it tasted periodtoken green beans in almond butter this side dish was surprisingly wonderful periodtoken probably my favorite dish of the night periodtoken the beans were perfectly cooked periodtoken crunchy and seasoned well periodtoken the butter sauce was dreamy and i love the touch of almond periodtoken every ingredient in the dish made sense and worked great together periodtoken   lots of beer on tap its definitely a good spot for a quick bite and drinks with friends periodtoken","7632":"the burger bread fell apart when youre trying to eat it periodtoken my pi\u00f1a colada it was delicious with ice cream on top periodtoken but i would not recommend going here for the food quality periodtoken weve had better quality burgers in the freezer section at whole foods periodtoken","7633":"the people are very commatoken very nice and friendly commatoken and the food is pretty reasonably priced periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the chicken is just average to me periodtoken i know commatoken i know commatoken walts the prize of northern delawares fried chicken commatoken but its just ok in my mind periodtoken its overly crispy commatoken and it isnt salted enough and i dont even like a lot of salt on my food but it says a lot about the chicken when you need more salt to hide the blandness periodtoken also commatoken what the hell is up with the rolls generic 3 by 3 inch white flour rolls i mean commatoken i wasnt expecting cracker barrelesque rolls but they should be embarrassed by what they put out periodtoken overall commatoken theyre not awful commatoken but i probably wont be going back periodtoken if youre in the area and want some good chicken commatoken try out the new semos on west 9th street commatoken or royal farms or kfc on kirkwood highway periodtoken","7636":"ive never been inside i have only ordered ice cream in the drive thru periodtoken it has been 2 years of going and they have not messed up my order periodtoken the only issue is that when its busy during the summer if the line is long i wont order a banana split periodtoken the reason is they make it right away sometimes and its already starting to melt by the time i get it periodtoken and by the time i get home its already soup periodtoken i only line 2 miles down the street periodtoken","7638":"really decent food for a really decent price periodtoken  i love that they have the sandwiches mostly prepared commatoken but undressed periodtoken  that makes them nice and fresh even when  they are mostly made ahead of time periodtoken  the food bar salad plus tons of items looked quite good periodtoken  i almost got it commatoken but the sandwich was too good looking to pass up periodtoken  avocado cant be wrong  i thought charging 1 extra for eggs at lunch is kinda bs since there were tons of people ordering them periodtoken  i mean extra charges are for abnormal orders or things that they put away commatoken but the eggs were none of that periodtoken","7639":"ok sushi commatoken cool designs and rolls periodtoken my issue is the price here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken for 2 people is was 100 and we brought our own wine periodtoken  we had 6 rolls commatoken 2 soups commatoken 2 salads periodtoken you can go to yokohomo or kabuki for half the price periodtoken for instance commatoken there eel roll is like 15 commatoken but it should be 68 periodtoken  just a pile of leaves are 7 periodtoken nothing else is in the salad periodtoken not much of an atmosphere except the beetles music and pictures periodtoken probably wont go back just based on the prices periodtoken","7642":"we are always happy to see new businesses move into our neighborhood periodtoken we have seen long lines at kermits and were hopeful that they represented the quality and selection of a great local bakery periodtoken unfortunately commatoken we have been unable to find things we like at kermits periodtoken we want some bread other than baguettes commatoken and we would love some baked goods without the dairy periodtoken  the prices for baguettes and baked goods are a little on the steep side periodtoken  the pizzas look great commatoken and there is a nice variety commatoken but unfortunately we arent big pizza fans periodtoken  so commatoken please kermits commatoken stay in the hood but work on the menu just a little bit periodtoken if you sold hearty loaves of wheat and rye breads and just one or two vegan cookies commatoken id be seeing you just about every night","7643":"stopped in here for lunch and walked out uncomfortable with a full belly was only going to get a grilled cheese sandwich commatoken but my checkin via yelp gave me a free soup so i went ahead and cashed in on it right there and then periodtoken got the smokey corn chowder with bacon commatoken and while it was quite delicious commatoken it was heavy and i probably could have made that my meal by itself periodtoken but no commatoken i continued on and ate all of my baja melt sandwich and washed it all down with a new hope root beer periodtoken i really wanted one of their shakes commatoken but im pretty sure i would have puked as i was utterly stuffed periodtoken i can only imagine how many calories and fat i took in during that hour commatoken which leads me to one gripethey dont publish their nutritional data on their web site periodtoken personally commatoken i get really frustrated when restaurants dont do this periodtoken there is a little kids seating area with a tv to keep them occupied periodtoken im surprised that they dont have a macncheese item on their menu periodtoken all in all though commatoken good food with friendly service commatoken but if you are watching your weight commatoken plan on hitting the gym after eating here periodtoken","7644":"ive only gotten to try one of their cupcakes the james bond red velveti tend to judge cupcake places based on their red velvet commatoken since everyone has their own version periodtoken the cupcake flavors are all named after people with j names commatoken which i think could get confusing real fast they were at a popup truck event at city hall commatoken but i dont know where they usually hang out periodtoken the cake was definitely moister than some other cupcakes ive had periodtoken the icing was just ok commatoken and the presentation was nothing spectacular periodtoken but hey commatoken its a good cupcake commatoken and thats all i needed right then periodtoken hopefully commatoken theyll be back in center city sometime soon so i can try a different flavor and see if i like it better periodtoken","7647":"im usually not one to complain about subway commatoken as its always good mainstream stuff periodtoken  however commatoken not sure whats going on with this particular location commatoken as well as the one around the corner on plumb commatoken which i believe are under the same ownership periodtoken  for at least the past 9 months commatoken its literally been a oneman show behind the counter commatoken even at the busiest times during lunch and dinner periodtoken  while im aware that even the simplest of restaurants are cutting back on labor these days commatoken this place just seems nonstop hectic commatoken and makes for a really long wait time commatoken even if theres only one or two people ahead of you in line periodtoken  the lone staff member has always been friendly commatoken and i gotta admit that this is one of the few locations where i make an extra special effort to leave something in the tip jar periodtoken  this lone employee is the sandwich artist commatoken bread baker commatoken dishwasher commatoken cashier commatoken cookie bagger commatoken and order taker commatoken all rolled into one although maybe not in that order  ive had much better experiences at the sierra street location downtown commatoken which usually has at least 2 people behind the counter commatoken making everything run much more efficiently periodtoken","7649":"the food is good but the kids working at this time are not listening to orders periodtoken i specifically told a asian girl not to put guacamole in my order periodtoken she did and charged me for it periodtoken they would not refund it periodtoken","7656":"no frills brewery periodtoken  great for groups

periodtoken  the night we had our party there were food trucks periodtoken","7657":"i had high hopes for the braised beef noodle soup commatoken but it was just okay periodtoken  it tasted decent commatoken but the portion was small periodtoken  someone else in my dinner party ordered the zha jiang noodles commatoken and it was pretty tasty periodtoken again commatoken the portion was not generous periodtoken the third person ordered the crispy pork cutlet bento box and was disappointed by both the taste and the portion periodtoken  it reminded him of hawaiian pork katsu commatoken just not as delicious and not as much of it periodtoken  we also ordered fried calamari and pork rolls as appetizers periodtoken  those two dishes tasted pretty good periodtoken  all in all commatoken the food was tasty commatoken but the prices were a bit too high for the small portions periodtoken","7659":"the sweet potato fries with jalape\u00f1o aioli keep me coming back i always get a bunless burger  each time i eat here i am disappointed periodtoken the price is so high for an okay burger periodtoken","7660":"a pretty decent place if youre just looking for a meal periodtoken   nothing all that remarkable on the upside commatoken but nothing on the downside either periodtoken   menu commatoken food quality and service were all very satisfactory periodtoken  nice lively atmosphere periodtoken  sometime you just want a place to eat that wont disappoint you and isnt a chain periodtoken you know  this place gets that done periodtoken","7662":"people like the depot and for me its not my kinda of thing so thats why im giving it a 3 start because that is dead middle and the fact it really isnt kid friendly when they say it is bugs me periodtoken but hey if you want to take your kids to a distillery more power to you periodtoken","7665":"had a really tasty taro bubble tea from tbar periodtoken  i had never had taro commatoken but the barista recommended it periodtoken  it tastes kind of like cookies and cream periodtoken  i think they need different cups though periodtoken  it was spilling all out the sides because they fill it up past the lid commatoken and also need bigger straws or smaller bubbles because they kept getting stuck in my straw periodtoken  the space seems nice commatoken definitely a good place to study periodtoken  ill stop by again if im in the neighborhood periodtoken","7668":"filipiniana is a middle of the road experience for me periodtoken ive been there twice now commatoken and tried the shaved ice dessert not the giant halo halo commatoken the purple ube cake commatoken and a couple of the drinks periodtoken the drinks are pretty average thai tea and iced coffee commatoken nothing special periodtoken the shaved ice was an experience  the first time i had it i had it with the red beans and wasnt crazy about it periodtoken the second time i nixed the beans and added some extra fruit periodtoken i was hoping for strawberries commatoken but the guy serving me said they needed to be tossed commatoken and i ended up with pineapple pieces periodtoken this one was a bit better commatoken but it still isnt my thing periodtoken now commatoken the ube cake is a different story periodtoken i poached a couple bites from my friend who ordered it periodtoken it wasnt overly sweet commatoken the coconut pieces were great commatoken and overall commatoken i didnt expect it to be the thing i liked the most periodtoken this place is at least an hour from me commatoken so i wouldnt drive alllll the way for this cake commatoken but if i was having lunch nearby or had errands in the area commatoken i would totally swing in and order one of the giant pieces periodtoken   the people working here are super friendly commatoken the location is a little hard to find if you dont know what youre looking for commatoken and the inside is very clean with lots of bright color periodtoken if the seating was a bit more comfortable i could see this being a fun place to hang out periodtoken","7670":"i had much higher expectations when i went for a visit periodtoken dont get me wrong the place is very cute commatoken staff is friendly and knowledgable commatoken item i purchased was tasty periodtoken but i just thought there would be more of a selection periodtoken now i did go after 5pm on a weekday commatoken so that may have something to do with it periodtoken i will definitely try them again periodtoken","7671":"good deep dish pie but it wasnt quite there periodtoken almost but didnt draw full circle periodtoken","7672":"great pastry and desserts periodtoken would have rated them 4 stars commatoken but didnt like the service periodtoken the person that took my order needs to stay in the back baking cakes until she learns how to treat customers periodtoken","7679":"this pizzeria was not bad commatoken but it was really mediocre and the pizza wasnt remarkable periodtoken it was st periodtoken louis style pizza commatoken but it really lacked the robust flavor found at most of the st periodtoken louis pizza places periodtoken its not bad commatoken but if you want st periodtoken louis style pizza commatoken there are other places close by that do a lot better periodtoken","7680":"i dont see what the big problem is commatoken honestly periodtoken i come to this subway quite frequently and usually get my sandwich quickly and at the quality i expect from the subway chain periodtoken   they lock their doors at 7 commatoken but their drivethru stays open beyond that periodtoken dont expect anything special commatoken just a sandwich on the go periodtoken","7684":"this place was right near where i was staying commatoken and it had been over a decade since id had a vegan cheesesteak in philly rip giannas commatoken so i was really ready to enjoy this periodtoken sad to say i just didnt like it the sauce tasted strange to me commatoken as did the steak which reminded me more of veggie beef noodles in a vegan chinese food dish rather than a  vegan cheesesteak periodtoken  i couldnt finish more than half commatoken and im not known for leaving vegan junk food on a plate periodtoken obviously commatoken different strokes for different folks commatoken some people in comments here seem to love it and say its the best in the city and maybe their method of making this is more refined or something periodtoken but in my opinion commatoken it just tasted gross and unappetizing periodtoken mini desert hubcap was ok commatoken some little chocolate peanut butter thing commatoken nothing special periodtoken  the best thing by far was the waterade watermelon lemonade periodtoken","7686":"i wish i could rate this place higher   watermelon drink only 1 periodtoken35 commatoken freshly blended with a bit of ice periodtoken perfect   edamame salad fresh ingredients commatoken but next to no seasoning which made it taste blend periodtoken server lady asked how it was and was very receptive to the feedback commatoken but the other person said to be the manager was not periodtoken disappointing periodtoken   purple cloud interesting combo of salmon and chicken tempura periodtoken loved red and green onions periodtoken perfect   fire tornado the topping was way too saucy and the whole thing ended up swimming in the sauce periodtoken it was out of balance and too rich periodtoken again commatoken server lady was appreciative of feedback but the manager was not commatoken which is a shame periodtoken   they are a new local business and we appreciated the clean commatoken modern decor commatoken but im not sure if id readily want to go back periodtoken i hope they improve and do well periodtoken","7690":"we came to this location on mothers day with the impression given to us that it is one of the best ones in the area for many reasons periodtoken  it did not live up to all the hype we were given periodtoken  we were seated right away commatoken which was great with our group of 10 periodtoken  drinks were promptly brought out and rolls presented periodtoken  ordering for a group our size has its challenges commatoken the first one being that my mil wanted the potato soup that they are known for and apparently on mothers day they were not serving it but they serve it every other day of the year periodtoken  once that was figured out commatoken we all got our orders in and everyone was happy with the loads of sauce that each entree was given one of the hypes we had heard about periodtoken  everything was eaten up as it arrived hot and ready to eat periodtoken  the waitress was super nice commatoken and did the best she could with the loads of questions and people she had to deal with at our table periodtoken  everything was boxed up perfectly at the end commatoken and she even threw in a box of rolls periodtoken","7691":"im updating a previous 1star review periodtoken  in july 2018 commatoken approximately 3 months after my order commatoken final gravity shipped my beer kits periodtoken  i havent had a chance to brew them yet but everything looks good periodtoken  i cant give 5 stars as the shipment time was excessive and communication was insufficient commatoken but they are a honorable business and did take care of my order periodtoken","7692":"hip city veg is on the move periodtoken  from its original rittenhouse square location commatoken it opened up in university city and now has plans for south broad street and washington d periodtokenc periodtoken  this is a successful fast food vegan establishment commatoken yet it is not my favorite commatoken  in an increasingly crowded market of health fastfood dining options in philadelphia commatoken hip city veg does some things well and other things not so well periodtoken  i do like their udon noodle salad but in my mind there is much too much arugula and too little of the other tasty ingredients be they peanuts commatoken chicken substitute commatoken daikon commatoken scallions or even udon itself periodtoken for the price periodtoken it would more accurately be named an arugula salad periodtoken  there are absolutely no condiments out for people to use periodtoken  aww cmon guys  i did ask and received a little sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit periodtoken  the sweet potato fries are good but again the portion is small in relation to the price in my opinion periodtoken there is free water which is nice to have periodtoken  at the university city location the staff are friendly and its kept clean periodtoken","7693":"i havent had a burger from johnny rocket in years but let me tell ya commatoken i devoured my rocket burger periodtoken i had a wonderful waitress named tina periodtoken she was adorable she made sure we were enjoying everything without being overbearing commatoken even though i was exhausted she brightened my day periodtoken thank you","7694":"pretty good food but consistently poor service periodtoken they also do a very bad job with to go orders periodtoken food orders have been mixed up multiple times and the pho is always placed in a brown paper bag with the bottom soaking from spoilage periodtoken again commatoken good quality food but they need to work on the basics","7701":"pretty good breakfast commatoken there omelets are very good but the service isnt all that great so if you are in a hurry definitely not a great place to go","7707":"legitimate 3 periodtoken5 star breakfast periodtoken  not to many frills here but you will get some decent eats commatoken no doubt periodtoken  eggs benny commatoken corned beef hash commatoken and the basic two eggs  ham  hash brown   and toast are all solid choices periodtoken","7708":"i went again this past thursday after dinner at amis periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenpnk is usually my favorite place but i was so turned off last night it might be awhile til i head back periodtoken  three of us were all standing at the bar watching the tv all star game and the bartender just up and turned it to some random channel everyone i was with thought it had to of been a mistake and there was no way that she didnt see us watching  we ended up not saying anything but someone else must have because within 2 minutes she turned it back periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenshe is the only rude bartender in the whole place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","7709":"nothing to write home about periodtoken  our server was good periodtoken  the other staff were friendly periodtoken  the drink was stiff periodtoken  the food was interesting commatoken but not great periodtoken  the oyster rockefeller special was good but the oyster got a little lost in the sauce periodtoken  the cheese empendada was cooked perfectly and stuffed full of rich cheese commatoken but was paired with a bitter kale salad periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it needed a sauce to cut the richness periodtoken  the plantains were cooked well commatoken but the relish with which it was served didnt quite work periodtoken  unfortunately because the small plates were underwhelming commatoken i doubt i will give the restaurant a chance to win me over on the entrees periodtoken","7711":"hubby and i love living in franklin commatoken and while we dont live in westhaven commatoken we frequent this neighborhood for the great little chinese place next door periodtoken  this past weekend we noticed a new neighbor to our stir fry haunt commatoken and had to pop in periodtoken   it seems they only opened two weeks ago commatoken and hi brow is a coffee place commatoken a pastry place commatoken and an ice cream place as well periodtoken  its a small little shop commatoken but the coffee aroma triples its square footage if the front doors are propped open like they were on the night we visited periodtoken  we enter the front door and see this huge farmhouse type table with this amazing chandelier and glass domed cake stands commatoken wire baskets of pastries commatoken and random other goodies with comfy benches to prop up a seat periodtoken  on one side theres a cooler with chilled beverages commatoken and at the back there is a small ice cream freezer sporting about eight flavors and a helpful commatoken smiling barista periodtoken  we had just eaten and of course were not hungry at all commatoken which means i got ice cream periodtoken  i picked a buttery caramel traditional cream based something or another flavor commatoken and it was yummy periodtoken  it was rich commatoken way rich commatoken i could tell ive been on pinkberry for a while now periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken a nice little treat periodtoken  a plus for some would be that they serve you ice cream in a cup with a wooden spoon commatoken felt like a balsa wood or something periodtoken  im all for saving the planet commatoken and i get that plastic is practically forever commatoken but i gotta say the sensation of that wooden spoon in your mouth with ice cream periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken not a fan periodtoken  it was just weird periodtoken  will we stop back in another day  im sure we will periodtoken  and ill opt for a cone commatoken and probably pick a less rich flavor for my palate commatoken but cute nonetheless periodtoken  the baristaice cream scooper lady said the name hi brow comes from the name of the farm the owners also own periodtoken  and if youre thinking that huge neon sign is just an hb and not hi brow commatoken youd be right periodtoken  signage isnt big here

could find an indian restaurant i could frequent in st pete periodtoken  it took a long search to finally find 1 in tampa that i now frequently order takeout from periodtoken i found this  place thru a yelp article ranking the top indian restaurants in pinnellas periodtoken real disappointed by this place periodtoken it wasnt bad indian food commatoken which i have definitely had before it just wasnt 4 periodtoken5 stars or 5 stars good periodtoken  i ordered the butter chicken and chicken korma medium spice with 2 garlic naans periodtoken i should have said medium hot commatoken because the medium was more mild than spicy for me periodtoken spiciness would  have helped some with the flavor periodtoken the spices  in the chicken entrees just tasted muted theyre there but you barely taste it and its not as robust as it should be periodtokenthe 3 containers 2 regular commatoken 1 extra large of rice was a bit overkill for the two small containers of butter chicken and korma we got periodtoken so pricey for such a small portion of the chicken entree at 15 dollars each periodtoken the garlic naan 3 dollars each  might as well been regular naan periodtoken i barely got the taste of garlic im use to periodtoken tasted so muted yes im comparing it to another place commatoken as i always do when trying out the same cuisines periodtoken my comparison is to indias grill located in tampa off kennedy periodtoken the butter chicken was the better of the two dishes but just average periodtoken the korma says its made with cashew paste commatoken but just tasted like yellow curry periodtoken i got no hint of the cashew nuttiness periodtoken for both dishes it just tasted like the curry and spices flavor needed perhaps more time to  build and marinate  the rice was bland periodtoken yes commatoken sure its white  basamati rice which is a fragrant rice in itself periodtoken but im use to the plain basmati white rice being fragrant from additional whole spices of bay leaves commatoken cinnamon stick n coriander seeds that elevates the natural fragrance periodtoken i thought maybe the flavors would soak in a lil more commatoken taste more flavorful the next day commatoken but sad to report still the same periodtoken","7714":"after a good night of pinball and drinks down the street i decided to take a friend from the uk to strange to check out the hype periodtoken  we each had a maple bacon and gooey butter  both were good but not quite up to the hype periodtoken  the vibe was cool commatoken staff fun and the donuts were fine just not what i consider great periodtoken  will give it another shot before final judgement periodtoken","7715":"i went here on a saturday night with high expectations commatoken but was kind of disappointed periodtoken  things started out well the hostess told us it would be an hour wait commatoken but we got a table within half an hour periodtoken  unfortunately it went downhill from there periodtoken    we ordered the mussels with white wine and lemon periodtoken when it arrived after a long wait commatoken the sauce was delicious commatoken but the mussels themselves were a little dried out commatoken like they had been sitting for a while periodtoken   after another looong interval commatoken our entrees finally arrived periodtoken  my medium rare burger was medium well at best commatoken which was a huge disappointment commatoken particularly at this place commatoken which seemed like theyd take pride in their burgers  there was some red juice on the plate commatoken so maybe it was initially medium rare and just sat under the warmer for too long the fries and pickle were yummy commatoken as were my friends pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips with mashie peas periodtoken    when i asked the server where my side of brussels sprouts was commatoken he replied commatoken oh commatoken the sides have all been coming out way after the entrees periodtoken  um periodtoken  if you realize thats happening commatoken maybe someone should fix it periodtoken  when they arrived halfway through the meal periodtoken they were delicious and steaming hot periodtoken  he also never brought me the side of mayo i asked for to go on my burger periodtoken   so commatoken in retrospect commatoken maybe all the problems could be explained by poor service  or poor time management in the kitchen  either way commatoken it wasnt everything i hoped itd be periodtoken there are plenty of other better gastropubs in the city","7717":"great kastle burgers great donuts  commatoken but sadly bad service  commatoken food is great tho periodtoken depending on what you get periodtoken","7718":"we had an early dinner at hellas periodtoken the place was just getting ramped

and eat again to try some of the other items on the menu periodtoken","7726":"was super excited to take my husband here for lunch  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but what a disappointment periodtoken the ambiance commatoken decor and service were as good as last time commatoken but the food  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken needed some work periodtoken  i had seen all the amazing photos of the grilled cheese commatoken so i had to have it periodtoken mine didnt look like the pictures though periodtoken the ratio of bread to filler wasnt great and the tomatoes had the hard cores you cant really eat periodtoken the soup had a skin on top and was really gelatinous periodtoken the sammie and the soup were both luke warm periodtoken husbands meal the dip was about the same periodtoken  it was a sad commatoken sad day periodtoken ill give it one more go because i was so impressed by my first visit  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken fingers crossed this was a fluke","7734":"this is a good solid spot for burgers and fries periodtoken theyre usually pretty busy commatoken but its usually worth the wait periodtoken service is usually pretty fast and the food is good periodtoken i would probably recommend this to a friend periodtoken","7737":"so went here after reading good reviews expecting something great but got something mediocre periodtoken  location is great but it is very tiny no tables inside just bar seating and only 4 tables outside on pier periodtoken food was ok but nothing to write home about and ive had better at red lobster periodtoken  waiter was nice and attentive and was pretty reasonably priced periodtoken","7739":"we got there late in the day and only 2 lb crabs were left so we opted for other menu items instead periodtoken i got lobster pasta very little lobster was evident and my wife got crab cakes mostly filler and seasonings periodtoken we also had shrimp bisque very little shrimp taste  the food was not bad commatoken but not great either periodtoken  very middle of the road commatoken thus 3 stars periodtoken  i think if youre not going to get the locally caught crab youd be better off dining somewhere else periodtoken","7740":"despite the wait and the blasting ac commatoken there is something appealing about the pancake pantry periodtoken  the waitresses are very nononsense and are good about keeping your coffee cup filled commatoken the service is amazingly quick considering the size and popularity of the pantry commatoken and getting to choose from all those crazy styles of pancakes is kind of fun periodtoken  i also like the dineroldtimey feel of the restaurant periodtoken  the peach pancakes were too syrupy and sweet for me commatoken but the buttermilk pancakes are pretty tasty periodtoken  the portions are huge commatoken so go hungry or choose a couple of items a la carte periodtoken     however periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the pantry isnt the kind of place i would patronize regularly periodtoken  since its such a nashville establishment commatoken it would be a good place to take the relatives from out of town periodtoken  but when i think about the lines commatoken the noise commatoken and the prices at  the pantry commatoken id much rather just make my own pancakes commatoken or go get some real coffee and a bagel at sam and zoes periodtoken","7742":"although h  w produce can be a bit of a drive for nonmilwoods residents to come here commatoken they have a great selection of vegetables at such a cheap price periodtoken  no kidding  the only drawback is you need to come at the right time of the week periodtoken  ive made the mistake of coming here a couple of times on a midweek evening and havent found a lot of fresh vegetables periodtoken  they really up the ante for the weekend rush commatoken so thats the best time to go  on quite a few occasions now commatoken ive come here and bought like two heavy bags of veggies and fruits and spent under 20 for it periodtoken  granted commatoken stuff like watermelon commatoken cauliflower etc periodtoken weigh a lot and dont cost that much periodtoken  but commatoken you get the point periodtoken  now commatoken when it comes to selection periodtoken  im amazed periodtoken  as much as i adhere to being a locavore off late commatoken i find that h  w carries some really unique vegetables and fruits that often times almost exclusively grow in parts of asia periodtoken  ive ended up going off the wagon a couple of times when ive had the dire need for some okra periodtoken  i think on one occasion i noticed 5 different kinds of aubergines  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  isnt that weird shit  yes  also commatoken maybe 56 different kinds of spicy peppers periodtoken  need i say more  definitely a unique experience buying groceries here periodtoken  definitely very affordable and even cheaper than superstore periodtoken  a bit of a drive and given my new fondness for locally grown stuff commatoken i may not be coming here that often periodtoken","7746":"my son and i have come here a few times as we waited for his chess lesson periodtoken  its a mcdonalds periodtoken  it is trying to be trendier mcdonalds periodtoken  flowers on the table commatoken cafe style commatoken etc periodtoken  one visit my son shared a magic

mcdonalds periodtoken","7749":"we were shoved in a tiny corner in the back room commatoken next to a huge party of pre teen girls periodtoken i walked out with a huge migraine due the manager and

nothing special periodtoken had to send mine back commatoken specifically asked for no bacon and entree came covered periodtoken  had to ask twice for silverware and napkins periodtoken","7752":"my girlfriend had high hopes for this place commatoken me on the other hand commatoken i have had the best barbecue in the city so i had my doubts periodtoken  it sucks when the best thing on your menu is tacos periodtoken  you wouldnt think a barbecue place would be telling the customers try the tacos periodtoken  theyre awesome while they are great commatoken youd expect more periodtoken  we each got an order of ribs periodtoken  my ribs were pretty good commatoken fall of the bone commatoken juicy commatoken very good periodtoken  her ribs on the other hand were tough commatoken had a very porky almost hot dog like taste commatoken she didnt like them at all periodtoken  mac and cheese was pretty solid","7755":"a decent safeway with friendly butchers periodtoken it can get overcrowded easily as many things as jammed together periodtoken they can probably handle that better but no major complaints about the service here periodtoken","7756":"i was a wee tot and lived in indy back

periodtoken the only thing was it was sort of hot inside well on to the bad stuff periodtoken the food is really bland commatoken like little to no taste  i was so disappointed and supper upset that we had to pay so much for food we cared nothing for but we arent the type to complain to get a discount or free food periodtoken i got the alfredo and added chicken 15 periodtoken it came with a salad which i got ranch and their ranch tasted like you barely had some left in the bottle and you took water and shook it up and poured in on my lettuce periodtoken and i say salad bc it seriously was just lettuce with some round olives on one side like 3 and some fine chopped tomatoes my husband got the lasagna 15 and a salad with ranch periodtoken the lasagna tasted like something from a chef boy r d can all of which was edible but they are not worth the money or even another try for maybe other items off the menu periodtoken periodtoken my son got a cheese pizza 7 and surprisingly it was the best thing there periodtoken after all its hard to mess up a cheese pizza like their bread they bring out to the table was bland all that and three drinks well actually two bc one was a water commatoken came to a total of 45 before tip periodtoken yes we still tipped bc like i said the people was nice its just the food was horrible    they do have like 3 pokemon go stops that you can use while your forcefully eating your bland dinner lol people set off lures over there like crazy as well ","7761":"i love panera but today i was really disappointed periodtoken i ordered the chicken salad with almonds periodtoken what i got was a tomato commatoken lettuce and maybe a tablespoon of chicken salad periodtoken it did not even cover the bread periodtoken i also ordered a salad but i have not eaten it yet periodtoken i usually order the turkey commatoken bacon and avocado sandwich which is so good periodtoken i will tell you to go to arbys if you want a really good chicken salad sandwich periodtoken the filling falls out of the bread periodtoken they use pecans instead of almonds periodtoken which i dont think i even found one in this sandwich periodtoken i will go back but i will never order this sandwich again periodtoken","7762":"ive had these donuts 3 or 4 times periodtoken they are ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken some like the maple bacon were downright amazing the first time i tried them since then commatoken though commatoken i feel the quality and craftsmanship has gone downhill periodtoken   the maple bacon commatoken for example commatoken had super crispy bacon commatoken and lots of it when i first had it the last time i had one commatoken there was maybe 14 slice of bacon crumbled on top and it was really soggy commatoken and very sloppily put together periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken like it had rolled down a hill and landed frostingsidedown periodtoken   i do feel its worth a try for the novelty of it commatoken because the flavors they come up with are indeed strange and really interesting i heard they recently had a surge donut commatoken and im kinda sad i missed that one periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  also commatoken 2donut what the what that sh is bananas periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken even if its for a banana foster donut","7766":"this place has a lot of hype  but in my opinion it is overrated periodtoken the marketdeli was extremely crowded and mazzaros is pretty small and narrow periodtoken in areas to maneuver through it became a maze to stay clear of the crowds i have learned that it is not a place to bring small kids periodtoken the sandwiches we ate there were sesame tuna pretty good but soggy commatoken bronze fish tasty but soggy and over sauced and meatball sub horrible mess and meatballs were too dense periodtoken the market part has some unique offerings commatoken but i can find most in speciality shops that are less crowded or online periodtoken i also brought home cookies from the bakery which were pretty good but we were not blown away periodtoken","7767":"solid place periodtoken  good selection and well stocked shelves periodtoken  while it is expensive it has a good selection of items periodtoken  they have both high end and gourmet items periodtoken  they also offer boars head cheese and meats periodtoken","7770":"service was great commatoken food was just okay periodtoken came here for dinner with a friend using a groupon that included one starter commatoken two sandwichesburgers and one dessert periodtoken   guacamole  you could definitely tell that it was made fresh to order as they claim on the menu commatoken but it was so bland periodtoken there were barely any red onions commatoken cilantro or jalapeno in it commatoken and it looked and tasted like mashed up avocados periodtoken  cowboy burger  this was pretty good periodtoken the brioche bun was toasted nicely and didnt get soggy periodtoken the patty was thick and cooked medium commatoken which is what i asked for periodtoken even though it had melted cheese commatoken barbecue sauce commatoken bacon and an onion ring commatoken it didnt feel overly greasy periodtoken it came with fries which there were a ton of periodtoken i didnt finish it because i wanted to leave room for dessert periodtoken   milehigh apple pie  this is ginormous it was served warm with vanilla ice cream

though they have more than just ice cream ha commatoken thats probably the only thing id come back for periodtoken","7773":"these donuts are on trend in that they are large commatoken yeasty commatoken and feature funky flavor combinations periodtoken unfortunately commatoken i found the donut to be very dry periodtoken i have made it a mission to try the best donuts wherever i travel  this does in fact seem to be the best spot in new orleans  but they just didnt stack up to what ive had in dc commatoken new york commatoken or chicago periodtoken i do think this place must have really good food outside of the donuts  it smelled very good periodtoken the staff was also very friendly periodtoken  one thing that was also a turn off was that they offered a passion and cocoa nib donut  this is a flavor combo that dough in nyc is famous for periodtoken i really hope these people didnt blatantly copy them periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken seems a little too obvious periodtoken","7774":"i stopped by this place after i got a massage next door periodtoken  i heard it just opened and figured why not try it out periodtoken  the food tastes decent but the portions are rather small periodtoken so to have a meal you really need the medium and large meals periodtoken  one of the medium meals i had was just under 8 and the other large was just under 13 periodtoken    personally at that price for the large commatoken i would rather go to ciccio cali and get myself a hot and spicy tuna bowel with spaghetti squash or kale periodtoken  the snacks and desserts were okay tasting and i could see if you had a sweet tooth these may be healthier options periodtoken   i think if you do not cook at all and dont know how to find held thy meals eating out this may be a good option commatoken every now and again periodtoken  but spending almost 900 upfront for 1000 in meals as a member doesnt seem like a good option periodtoken   as someone who cooks commatoken i know i can make similar health meals for 14 of the price since fresh groceries from publix runs me about 60 per week periodtoken  bottom line not a good value for the money","7775":"if you can make it there commatoken do it periodtoken great produce selection periodtoken the strawberries are like candy periodtoken however commatoken it really sticks in my craw that they dont allow dogs periodtoken my dog is super well behaved and we came on vacation with our pet periodtoken we had to turn around as soon as we got there because of the no dog rule periodtoken they are losing customers that way periodtoken if we didnt come with a big group who could watch the dog commatoken they would have lost our business periodtoken","7779":"yes the ice cream is good commatoken and this place is rapidly becoming a new orleans institution periodtoken however commatoken ya its good but commatoken i dont find it extra ordinary or overly exceptional periodtoken i dont know maybe i should try the house specialty or something and maybe my opinion would change periodtoken oh and fyi  they only except cash periodtoken","7780":"this seems like a typical indian grocery store periodtoken  definitely has a good selection of items one would find in commatoken say nj or near philly commatoken so major kudos to them periodtoken i had to take one star off because sign on the door says they take amex yet their counters are not equipped with that capability periodtoken  major unforeseen inconvenience periodtoken although out of the way from any major highways commatoken this i maybe the closest indian grocery store to the berks county area periodtoken with any lack of competition commatoken the price is expected to be higher than one would find in the norristown area commatoken not a big deal periodtoken hopefully they will be around for many years to come periodtoken","7782":"burger and fries were good commatoken our server was flaky commatoken and the atmosphere was cozy periodtoken  the best part about the entire visit was the house made black cherry cream soda and the nostalgic pictures of indianapolis on the wall periodtoken","7785":"i just cant give besito more than 3 stars knowing i can head over to acapulco grocery store or taqueria emanuel and get better tacos for half the price periodtoken   sure commatoken if you took your date to a mexican grocery store youd probably go home alone that night periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but if your date is a true foodie then the way to a womans heart is through her stomach periodtoken plus she will be blown away by

decor commatoken good service periodtoken","7787":"we ordered 12 pcs periodtoken angel wings and fried pickles periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe got the food and server just disappear periodtoken

turkey club sandwhich periodtoken which was really  good commatoken the thyme mayo was delicious to get a good taste of their beer commatoken get the sampler commatoken which has 6 different  flavors of small beers for 10 periodtoken   my reason for giving them a 3 is the snotty attitudes of their staff periodtoken our waiter was alright commatoken but didnt  do anything  above and beyond periodtoken when we went to leave we visited the gift shop commatoken where a lot of items were missing  prices periodtoken the hostess was less than thrilled to answer questions and when we checked out commatoken the two ladies were too involved in their own conversation to offer any pleasantries periodtoken it was very rude and tainted our whole experience periodtoken","7790":"we had just an okay time periodtoken not sure if it was the small group or the long stories periodtoken seems the intention was to go to restaurants to have us order a drink and pay extra periodtoken im sure the participating restaurants would appreciate this periodtoken i thought the tour was going to be focused on the history and types of food not necessarily about the history of the restaurants periodtoken also seeing a mouse in the napoleon restaurant was a big turn off periodtoken i get the buildings are old but no excuse to have rodents in the dining room periodtoken yuck preston was nice commatoken knowledgeable and very familiar with the area periodtoken food was good and portions were large for a tasting  i think the pace of the tour can pick up periodtoken it was very slow periodtoken","7793":"o my buns is new franchise that opened up near the food court in park place mall periodtoken  they give away free samples commatoken and their store reminded me of those little korean bakeries you find in some cities periodtoken  their flyers on the mall entrance doors states that these are fresh buns periodtoken  it is not like they are reinventing cinnabons commatoken but these are just pastry sweet breads rolled out with different flavors periodtoken  they are a good combination with coffees and teas periodtoken  there are plenty of coffee drinks at o my buns commatoken and the buns have hints of tiramisutasting powder in them periodtoken  they are fairly sweet and spongy periodtoken  i think they were 1 periodtoken75 each periodtoken","7796":"my husband and i visited simpson house tea room because we purchased a deal through living social periodtoken we had never been to simpson before so we thought the living social deal offered a great opportunity to check it out periodtoken we visited on a day when there was some rough commatoken icy commatoken winter weather periodtoken the tea house is absolutely adorable and food and presentation is impressive periodtoken the amount of food you get with the living social deal was also impressive for the price periodtoken based on ambiance and quality of food commatoken i would give the tea house a solid 4 stars periodtoken the thing that wasnt pleasant about the experience was the service and the attitude of the server that daywhom told me at checkout she was the owner periodtoken from the moment we walked in commatoken the server was very short and not very inviting periodtoken i attempted to make small talk about the weather and her response showed that she was not happy to be there that day periodtoken even at checkout on the way out commatoken she was cold and short with her comments periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenalmost argumentative at times periodtoken i even complimented the food to which i received a response of  weve been doing this for 13 years commatoken it better be right periodtoken a simple thank you would have been a nice response periodtoken there was only one other table with people at it when we arrived periodtoken so not a busy day periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmost likely because of the poor weather conditions periodtoken i learned the hard way that there were no substitutions with tea sandwiches when using a living social deal periodtoken when i asked that a certain sandwich be omitted and another sandwich be put in its place or just leave the 2 sandwiches out completely as to avoid waste commatoken i was  unpleasantly told that the sandwiches are already made up and there are no substitutions periodtoken then i heard an elderly woman whom appeared to be another employee there dining with friends at the other table yell across the room we can double up today on the sandwiches commatoken its no problem periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe didnt make anything of it really as we didnt really know who the woman was that made the comment periodtoken i saw the elderly woman get up and go into the kitchen and then realized she was either an owner or employee periodtoken this part is what bothered us most commatoken i heard our server yell at the elderly woman from the kitchen you shut your mouth periodtoken my guess is that the nice elderly lady addressed our tea sandwich request to the server periodtoken we heard her clear as day in the dining area periodtoken it seemed the elderly woman was more interested in making our first experience more pleasant than our server was periodtoken seeing that this was our first visit to the tea house commatoken we would think that it would be important to make a good impression and provide friendly service so that the visiting guest returns periodtoken i get that the weather was miserable and that people have bad days periodtoken perhaps we caught our server on a bad day periodtoken it just left us feeling very unwelcome and we are not wanting to return to the tea house periodtoken good commatoken friendly service plays a huge part in dining experiences periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot just great food and ambiance periodtoken i also was surprised that at the end of our experience commatoken we were handed a card with a breakdown of taxes we were responsible for  and a suggested gratuity amount periodtoken in all the times ive ever used a living socialgroupon voucher at a restaurant commatoken we never received something like this periodtoken in other cases commatoken the paid voucher covers all food and taxes periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand then we always leave gratuity on the original cost of the food periodtoken the card reminder and breakdown in a check folio was a little bit tacky in my opinion periodtoken before visiting the tea house commatoken i thought that if we were pleased with our experience that we would return with some out of town guests that will be visiting in a few weeks periodtoken after the dining experience commatoken we decided we will be taking our guests to a different tea house periodtoken","7798":"sigh periodtoken  my kingdom for an experience that doesnt degrade over time like a bad drug habit periodtoken  i have gotten burned out with my normal venues and in a frantic mental search for where i hadnt been that was relatively close and might be ok commatoken i remembered amelia greys  i keep passing by at times when its closed or for some reason cant go commatoken and then i forget about it when im going periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenin any case commatoken id been meaning to go commatoken and hadnt periodtoken  the native cafe used to be a favorite and that location has since had trouble keeping an anchor periodtoken   when i arrived on this weekday morning commatoken it was no longer ags commatoken but prep  pastry periodtoken  therefore commatoken part of the imagery which had drawn me  ie commatoken bakery case and cafe feel  was gone periodtoken  instead commatoken it was a nicely appointed restaurant in the ubiquitous chunks of wood and lofty ceiling all the places in tucson now must do periodtoken  maybe you cant even get a buildout permit in tucson if you dont use that aesthetic commatoken its that pervasive periodtoken  the first thing i noticed was that the hostess stand is in the wrong place periodtoken  it needs to be further to the left so that a table or two can be put in front of the fire place without congesting the entry periodtoken  now that space looks oddly empty and the flow through is wrong periodtoken  the second thing i noticed is that this place is heavy on the young men periodtoken  a woman may likely greet you and cook commatoken but most of the servers ive seen are men periodtoken  thats interesting and definitely creates a vibe which im not sure if i like or dont periodtoken    the first day commatoken i was delighted to see that breakfast in some form can be had in the afternoons periodtoken  as we know commatoken breakfast is best had at any time of day and should be always on offer commatoken but rarely is periodtoken  i had the simple breakfast commatoken which was indeed simple commatoken but for a restaurant of a certain genre commatoken not badly priced at 6 periodtoken  except commatoken you know commatoken they scrimp on the toast periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenartisan toast periodtoken  eye roll periodtoken  my biggest complaints were that the eggs were heavy on the salt commatoken the bread was too hard and the bacon too soft periodtoken  the coffee was very good commatoken even if my server was too busy talking football and whatnot to refill it timely periodtoken  i did feel that i would be getting better service if i was cuter commatoken which is not what you want periodtoken  all in all commatoken though commatoken my experience was good and i was sure to come back periodtoken  so commatoken i did periodtoken  sadly commatoken it was a downhill experience periodtoken  this time i made sure to come in the hours of a full breakfast menu commatoken only to find that it wasnt appreciably more varied periodtoken  i ordered the omelette after the waiter had fawned on its inclusion of steak commatoken 5yr cheddar commatoken mushrooms commatoken tomatoes periodtoken  yum periodtoken  it arrived commatoken again oversalted and without a trace of steak periodtoken  my toast also arrived hard and completely dry commatoken with no butter or jam periodtoken  sigh periodtoken  coffee was still good periodtoken  but commatoken heres what kinda altered my good feelings periodtoken  hey commatoken you know commatoken theyre new and im well willing to let some bugs get worked out while everyone is figuring out what works periodtoken tweaking is inevitable periodtoken so commatoken when i pointed out the lack of a major ingredient in my dish commatoken i wasnt mad periodtoken  just commatoken you know commatoken fix it periodtoken  however commatoken the answer i got was that the waiter had made a mistake and read the beefsteak tomatoes as steak and tomatoes periodtoken  ok commatoken again commatoken these amusing foibles take place periodtoken  and  and nothing periodtoken  though i would not have ordered the dish as it was and although the waiter was clearly in error commatoken no one seemed to feel that warranted any attention periodtoken  not a comped danish or coffee or jack periodtoken  so commatoken what had been a good time by all was now a source of irritation at dumb customer service commatoken which commatoken if i am being frank about my bias commatoken i think may relate to having so many boys in the house periodtoken  theres so often just a periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlack of social finesse and empathic awareness when boys are in charge tony  makerhouse is a huge exception to this generality periodtoken  it all reminded me of the book commatoken 5 apology languages periodtoken  i am commatoken most decidedly commatoken in the accepting responsibility and restitution camps periodtoken  i am not interested in your flowery debasement commatoken nor is mere acknowledgment enough periodtoken  i want to know how youre going to make it right periodtoken  because commatoken otherwise commatoken an apology without making it right just tells me that youre paying lip service and really dont give a shit if im happy periodtoken    so commatoken yes commatoken ill probably go back for limited wants commatoken but it is unlikely to be my goto periodtoken  and guys  cut it out with the salt commatoken for christ sake periodtoken","7800":"go for the beer periodtoken its some of the best ive ever had periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbedotter being the stand out periodtoken the food is good but its essentially upscale bar food periodtoken service tends to be slow when theyre busy periodtoken that said great beer commatoken decent food periodtoken worth a look periodtoken make reservations on weekends and be prepared to scramble for parking periodtoken","7803":"baked goods are delicious especially jam with custard croissant  periodtoken  flan was a bit heavy  commatoken chicken tamales tasted so good but kinda dry periodtoken not the best chili relleno but was ok periodtoken  cheap","7804":"went for happy hour for the second time most recently periodtoken our first visit the food was very good commatoken but our second visit was terrible periodtoken so mixed results although the happier menu and prices are not bad at all periodtoken","7805":"started a saturday morning excited to try some strange donuts periodtoken walked in to a such an upbeat commatoken fun place music was playing commatoken staff was friendly and they were giving out free birthday donuts periodtoken i really liked the fun atmosphere   we ordered a campfire commatoken maple bacon commatoken jelly and gooey butter periodtoken my favorite was the campfire periodtoken cake donuts are not usually my favorite commatoken but these were the best out of the ones we ordered periodtoken the dough tasted different than your typical cake donut periodtoken a bit lighter and drier and paired well with coffee periodtoken  the maple bacon topping and icing were great commatoken but i didnt like the glazed type dough at all on this one periodtoken the topping is what made the  maple bacon edible periodtoken if it was just glazed i wouldnt have eaten more than a few bites periodtoken my husband felt the same about the jelly donut periodtoken dry commatoken bland commatoken almost inedible dough periodtoken  i really enjoyed the atmosphere commatoken friendly service and creative toppings periodtoken i really wanted to love the donuts commatoken but thought they were just okay periodtoken if i happen to be in the area again one morning commatoken i might stop in for another cake donut commatoken but probably wont go out of my way to come here periodtoken","7806":"im going to give them 3 stars commatoken because i understand the growing pains they are experiencing periodtoken  the food isnt bad and they try very hard with an inexperienced waiting staff periodtoken management can turn this around periodtoken","7807":"first time we had eaten at the new location periodtoken  the building and decor are a great improvement and are nice and modern periodtoken  it was busy on a saturday night but we were seated quickly periodtoken  mostly families including people of all ages periodtoken  the cute waitress was attentive and pleasant periodtoken  service was reasonably quick given that they were full periodtoken  overall the food was hohum periodtoken  the minestrone soup was very good and my wife liked her salad periodtoken   the main courses periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot so much periodtoken  the ravioli was pasty possibly undercooked and the sauce was mediocre periodtoken  her spaghetti was ok but she was not excited about it periodtoken  rolls were a bit dry and boring periodtoken  there was plenty of it periodtoken  the menu is pages long and there is a lot of variety available periodtoken  they would probably be better off of they focused on making a shorter list of choices taste better periodtoken  we know better italian restaurants commatoken but this one is close to home periodtoken  if we come back commatoken that will be the reason periodtoken","7808":"my husband and i are in nashville commatoken searching for dog friendly establishments amidst the 40 degree weather periodtoken this place has a perfect patio with heaters to keep you warm commatoken which allows dogs to come hang periodtoken  i wont lie commatoken i was skeptical to come here periodtoken from the pictures on yelp commatoken i was pretty disinterested periodtoken but commatoken with our dog commatoken the options were limited periodtoken  we arrive and was promptly greeted by first our waiter commatoken and then our real waitress periodtoken she was very smiley and kind and pretty commatoken but i will say as our time went on it declined just a little periodtoken  the staff was more than willing to provide a few tasters before we chose our beers periodtoken the first waiter filled our dogs water bowl with tons of water periodtoken   i would probably come back if i lived in nashville commatoken but as a tourist commatoken i think there are better options periodtoken the two things that made this have to be a 3star review were as follows periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  1 periodtoken the potato chips that come with the sandwiches are lays periodtoken please commatoken please make some house made chips they always rock when you do periodtoken  2 periodtoken smoking is allowed on the patio well commatoken duh its a patio periodtoken yeah commatoken but when the patio is basically a room because of the liners that go around commatoken any smoke is going to remain and travel over to you periodtoken cough cough periodtoken","7811":"i would say that this place has the right idea but the execution is a bit off  i love the idea of a good burger place that focuses on good commatoken quality ingredients periodtoken i would say that bareburger has that right periodtoken however commatoken the burgers are nothing special and mine was a bit overcooked i get mine medium and it was a little over periodtoken additionally commatoken i would say it was a bit bland periodtoken  the beer selection was just ok and the prices were a bit steep periodtoken  i would say that the atmosphere was a bit off as well periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken kinda empty commatoken weird decor commatoken music that seemed a bit too quiet and slow for a burger joint periodtoken  i would give bareburger another chance if the prices came down a bit or the burger got a bit bigger commatoken or the beer menu expanded periodtoken for now commatoken i will wait and have my burgers elsewhere periodtoken","7813":"i had been on a quest for this elusive falafel truck for many months periodtoken the exotic locale and precious few hours open make it quite difficult for me to reach commatoken but i had read so much about this enigmatic vehicle that i waited patiently for a chance to escape the laboratory for the express purpose of discovering this fabled cuisine periodtoken   during my first attempt commatoken i arrived at 115 commatoken which is not such an unreasonable hour of the afternoon periodtoken there were approximately 5 falafel seekers ahead of me commatoken but alas commatoken i was told he would not be serving any more customers that day periodtoken bollocks my plans were foiled commatoken and the mythical falafel had evaded me periodtoken   i anxiously awaited another opportunity to seek this supposed holy grail of middle eastern food periodtoken the second time i arrived at 1130 commatoken and was forced to wait interminably periodtoken but wait i did commatoken suffering through fathomless prattle from the proprietor commatoken to which i politely smiled and nodded in response periodtoken finally commatoken my toils and currency were justly rewarded with a heavy platter of delicioussmelling sustenance periodtoken    end dramatization    it was a lot of food commatoken but also kind of expensive at 10 a platter periodtoken as the guy said commatoken you could pay a lot more at a restaurant for food like that periodtoken true commatoken but this is a food truck and not a restaurant periodtoken the chicken and rice truck in new york is about half the price and twice the deliciousness periodtoken   most of it tasted good commatoken even really good commatoken but nothing was particularly outstanding except for maybe the grapeandotherunidentifiablethingssalad commatoken which was very interesting in flavor periodtoken everything else was a little too garlicky even for my taste commatoken and im the kind of person who could snort garlic powder periodtoken also commatoken the chicken and falafel were both too burnt commatoken and i generally like a little charred flavor periodtoken   it may be worth noting that my friend politely asked several times if it would be possible to bring another platter back for someone else periodtoken he began to babble about a liquor license and something about drinks periodtoken im not sure if he legitimately doesnt have a firm grasp of the english language commatoken or if he was consciously choosing to ignore her question by rudely changing the subject and feigning incomprehension periodtoken   was it good sure periodtoken was it worth all that time commatoken effort commatoken and money on my part maybe not periodtoken still commatoken the falafel nazi is worth trying at least once commatoken as long as its not too out of the way for you periodtoken","7816":"this is a great place to go to find unusual food items periodtoken  the staff is amazing and courteous periodtoken  they have a sample station in the back periodtoken  they can get quite busy periodtoken i recommend going during the week periodtoken  pricing isnt always cheap but i wouldnt say it is expensive periodtoken  they have little mini carts for the kids periodtoken  i really like their selection of fresh flowers periodtoken  really like tjs periodtoken","7818":"ill agree with other reviewers this place really needs to be remodeled or use their drivethrough service and they were prompt courteous and quick and the food is good so kudos for that but lets address the place up a little things would be much more enjoyable","7819":"weve been wanting to try kanellas brunch for about a year now and given that we needed to be in the area commatoken we decided to try it out periodtoken we stopped in without reservations around 1pm and when my bf told the server we didnt have a reservation but it was his birthday commatoken they did their best to accommodate us periodtoken luckily commatoken one of the tables didnt show up for their reservation so we got to stay our server was awesome periodtoken so eager to help and make recommendations commatoken and super friendly periodtoken we decided on the watercress salad and cuttlefish commatoken both of which were specials periodtoken we also got the lamb sausage and duck egg breakfast periodtoken the food was good commatoken but we werent overly impressed by anything periodtoken we really enjoyed the lamb sausage dish commatoken but felt that it was a bit small periodtoken the salad was good commatoken but nothing special periodtoken i felt that the flavor of parsley somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish commatoken but i also dont really like parsley so i may have been particularly sensitive periodtoken given the incredible reviews commatoken im wondering if we just didnt order all that well commatoken especially because we love meditarranean food periodtoken the service was excellent periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe server put a candle in our order of baklava without our even asking periodtoken i would definitely go back and try it again periodtoken","7821":"i tried the korean bbq taco periodtoken i had really high expectations for this taco only because ive had these tacos before in los angeles from a food truck called kogi periodtoken i ordered 1 just incase i didnt like it commatoken well it was no where near as good as the ones from la periodtoken the meat was cut in really big chunks and it was super fatty periodtoken im not kidding when i say this commatoken every piece of meat in the taco was pure fat periodtoken i also tried the southern fried chicken taco periodtoken now that taco was pretty damn good i also tried the beans and rice periodtoken cant really mess up on beans commatoken the rice on the other hand had its own twist periodtoken it was a very very good twist haha periodtoken my wife had a blended margarita that was probably the best ive had in tennessee commatoken and trust me ive tried a lot of them periodtoken the establishment itself was super clean and modern periodtoken i really like the bar top they had periodtoken all in all commatoken good food and a great vide","7823":"really fancy breakfast food periodtoken thats all it really is commatoken eggs and bacon can only be made so nice periodtoken the real gem is their bakery right next door they are not even separated by a wall periodtoken they have dozens of types of baked goods commatoken from cookies to cakes periodtoken those are worth buying in dozens periodtoken","7824":"i am not a big fried fish fan so going here so we ended up here only because its obligatory when you are in clearwater periodtoken the decor is fun commatoken kind reminded me of joes crab shake and we had a great server periodtoken she was extremely attentive and friendly periodtoken i point this out because we tried to go here last night for dinner commatoken but the hostess at the podium was rude and wouldnt provide an answer when we asked her how long the wait would be for a table periodtoken we ended up elsewhere periodtoken that said commatoken the food this afternoon was a ok periodtoken we had the crab dip which was pretty delicious and i had the mahi mahi tacos periodtoken they were just ok nothing to write home about commatoken but good enough for the price periodtoken i also thought the fries were pretty tasty periodtoken i finished off my meal with the peanut butter pie which i recommend highly periodtoken it was clearly a frozen variety that was premade commatoken but still very tasty periodtoken a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon when you cant be on the beach periodtoken","7825":"jackpot  777 777 777 yelp review 777 for me everyone playing the slots would love to see lucky 777 for big money  while i was in tampa commatoken i decided to check out the seminole hard rock casino periodtoken the new south parking garage had just opened when i was here periodtoken i didnt stay at the hotel commatoken so this review is based on the casino periodtoken  oh man the floor was very busy and mobbed with a sea of old folks commatoken with most slot machines in this big casino being played periodtoken i felt very young commatoken like i was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center periodtoken i think to myself as a current working class taxpayer commatoken i really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their social security and medicare checks periodtoken sigh  the casino also has poker tables commatoken texas hold em tournaments commatoken bars commatoken nightclub commatoken restaurants commatoken food court commatoken and the hard rock retail store periodtoken i saw the food here was on the pricey side and its good that i ate lunch before stopping here periodtoken i did some shopping at the retail store and picked up some cool hard rock pins and tshirts periodtoken this store does not accept the hard rock cafe all access card points program commatoken but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card periodtoken   overall commatoken its not vegas commatoken but its a decent place to play the slots in the tampa bay area with very easy highway access tofrom i4 periodtoken","7827":"the menu is 95 vietnamese but they do have thai and korean dishes too periodtoken i got the seasons special banh mi sandwich and a strawberrybanana boba tea periodtoken the bread was what made the sandwich awesome periodtoken nice and warm commatoken crispy outside and soft inside commatoken it was well done all of the ingredients tasted fresh and was piled in periodtoken it was smaller than normal but well worth the 3 periodtoken50 periodtoken i was tempted to get another periodtoken the boba tea was nothing special periodtoken   the young commatoken bubbly cashier had a difficult time explaining what the special was and the kitchen needs to work on timing periodtoken i got my sandwich and finished it long before my drink came out periodtoken i also watched two girls walk out with nine yes nine drinks and they ordered them after me periodtoken   the place is small with a handful of tables commatoken some with a random chairs that seems out of place but the decor is fun and inviting periodtoken they also have a pastry case with dessert items like cupcakes commatoken truffles commatoken and assorted cakes and sweets periodtoken in addition commatoken they have a variety of prepackaged asian candy and cookies with hello kitty items periodtoken if you enjoy tea commatoken they have a great selection of teas including oolong and custom made teas for sale periodtoken","7829":"if im in old city not olde city and need a vitamin water or whatever

sylvias can fix a few things they have potential to be a 4 at most periodtoken i am being nice and understanding that they are new so i gave them a 3 instead of a 2 periodtoken they have been

periodtoken  i was the first one to arrive and the building on the outside looked very nice commatoken and the inside did as well periodtoken there is a large takeout area near the parking lot

commatoken contemporary commatoken and designed well periodtoken  the hostess seemed a little off and wasnt quick to greet me commatoken so i went up to her periodtoken she was pretty prompt with

times commatoken i addressed that periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmoving on periodtoken  while i was waiting on my family members to arrive i sat at the bar and watched the rest of the fsu

times while were trying to place our order because everything was so unorganized periodtoken  after waiting for our food for a good 45 minutes my aunt couldnt take it anymore periodtoken she got up and went to the owner and back to the kitchen demanding our food commatoken or that we would leave periodtoken i held my head down and just laughed because i already knew that this night was going to

dont really have an answer for that commatoken just wanted to try it i guess periodtoken  and hey commatoken im glad i did periodtoken  everything there is clearly homemade commatoken everything was really pretty damn solid periodtoken    they had goat commatoken which was the first time i had ever eaten goat periodtoken  and it was really tender and tastey periodtoken    despite it being the last half hour of their lunch buffet everything was still pretty fresh periodtoken    i will say commatoken i do still prefer new delhi which is right around the corner and the same damn price but this place is a really solid alternative choice periodtoken","7842":"unless youre really into pancakes commatoken you can skip this restaurant periodtoken only being an ok fan of pancakes commatoken i still went because one of my friends loves pancakes and because the line was out the door commatoken down the block and around the corner periodtoken i figured it must be good with that kind of wait  all i can say is eh periodtoken i wasnt blown away periodtoken   we ordered the sweet potato pancakes for the table to try commatoken which were actually really really good and literally melted in your mouth but besides that commatoken i was not impressed with anything else on the menu periodtoken i ordered an omlette that came with a side of buttermilk pancakes periodtoken the omlette was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken really nothing special periodtoken the buttermilk pancakes were definitely good but wasnt jaw dropping commatoken stop talking because im stuffing my face good periodtoken my friends ordered different varitation of pancakes and i guess maybe i was expecting too much periodtoken i periodtokene periodtoken they might use different batter for their fruit pancakes or something but they dont periodtoken its just the buttermilk with fruit dropped in it or on top periodtoken   i will say though that their cinnomon syrup was heaven periodtoken if you go commatoken you have to use it periodtoken its really wonderful periodtoken if they dont do this already commatoken they should bottle it and sell it because its that good periodtoken they also warmed all the syrup which i thought was a nice touch periodtoken the hash browns are also worth getting periodtoken i thought it was pretty good periodtoken   service was ok but expected at a place like this periodtoken we sat by the kitchen and noticed there was a back log of food sitting on the counter periodtoken the servers couldnt get it out fast enough periodtoken   things to avoid on the menu the parisienne periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i think people at this place have a different definition of thin because these were definitely not crepe like periodtoken it looked like they took regular pancakes and rolled it up periodtoken the fresh squeezed oj that was 7 and definitely did not taste fresh squeezed is definitely worth avoiding too periodtoken  if i ever make my way back to nashville commatoken i think the only way id come back is if i didnt have to wait in like for an hour periodtoken","7846":"went here for brunch on saturday afternoon periodtoken the menu was kind of small and had more lunch choices rather than breakfast where i like an even proportion of both periodtoken i ordered the breakfast americana which was good commatoken but nothing extraordinary commatoken but i mean i guess it is kind of hard to make eggs and bacon fabulous periodtoken their fries were delicious though i must say periodtoken i wanted to try the windsor burger but refrained as i was in a breakfast mood periodtoken i hear it is quite delicious and i guess i will have to go back and see periodtoken","7850":"i like remedy periodtoken  havent tried too much of the food commatoken but have had the wraps and am waiting to still try the dosas periodtoken  given that i my roots are from the south of india commatoken i must say that i tend to have very high expectations for the dosa clan of food items which is quite different from north indian food naans etc periodtoken  now commatoken what i have tried i really ilke periodtoken  they make an awesome himalayan chai which is green in color periodtoken  strongly infused with crushed pistachios commatoken extremely flavorful and filling periodtoken  its caffeine free too periodtoken  its really more like flavored milk periodtoken   i also like some of the other things out there periodtoken  they have a large variety of tea bags that you can pick up for your hot tea periodtoken  remedy has some seriously filling muffins etc periodtoken to go with teacoffee for those just looking for the cafe experience periodtoken  mostly whole grain muffins with high fiber and filling as hell commatoken its great for an afternoon break from work kind of thing periodtoken  i like em periodtoken  the food looks very good commatoken to be honest periodtoken  i cant wait to try some of the things periodtoken  dosa is one commatoken but even some of the more traditional north indian varieties look pretty good periodtoken  another review will appear commatoken once ive tried the food","7851":"we love the food here commatoken but theyve recently changed how they provide service periodtoken we ordered takeout commatoken just three tacos and some queso it took us 35 minutes to receive our food periodtoken  this is unacceptable and disappointing periodtoken  we will give them a few more chances commatoken but if this continues we will find our taco fix elsewhere periodtoken","7852":"good oysters on the half shell periodtoken bad seating control periodtoken there were open seats inside that they were not using   just letting people stand around and wait periodtoken the inside of the restaurant smelled like a dive bar periodtoken we ended up just ordering at the to go window on the side of the place and eating at a picnic table on the pier periodtoken people were leaving that were on the wait list because it took too long to get seated periodtoken the people managing the seating list were not very helpful and had an attitude periodtoken","7853":"a bit oldfashioned in the decor and definitely  not a trendy place commatoken but good commatoken straightup seafood periodtoken  plenty of crabs in their crabcakes or crab balls commatoken stuffed shrimp was awesome commatoken and cocktails were good and reasonably priced commatoken just kind of a snore of a place as far as ambience periodtoken","7855":"tried 3 flavors out before i decided which one i liked ended up loving the oreo flavor and going with a milkshake it was delicious sadly the only reason i can give it the full 5 stars it so whole heartily deserves was due to the portion size periodtoken for 7 i was disappointed to get a sample of the delicious oreo flavored ice cream creation periodtoken love the over all shop and chalkboard menu commatoken too","7856":"we think the food is ok with reference to most of their sandwiches periodtoken   we are not beer drinkers but all the reviews indicate that they have a great selection periodtoken  i have to take them down a star because we go to hear live music close to home and they will no longer be having any  bleh  guess its just the ale that has good food commatoken great drinks and live music periodtoken","7857":"a great little frozen custard place they may not have as many flavors as other shops commatoken but their custard is creamier than any other frozen custard ive tried periodtoken if youre not in the mood for a large sundae commatoken the kiddie size is a great option periodtoken  the only downside is that there isnt a whole lot of seating and parking may be a bit difficult to find periodtoken","7858":"closed until may 2016 periodtoken google maps knew it was closed but i foolishly followed the yelp app which stated it was open periodtoken silly me commatoken yelp really needs to update the hours and days open for businesses periodtoken   i rely on yelp but after it failed me in this instance i am wanting to consider other sources commatoken periodtoken how is it that google knew the place was closed","7860":"district commatoken your staff is always super nice periodtoken the owner who is always there is also very nice and always greets us periodtoken your coffee is good and that miso praline breakfast sandwich is like the blood of virgins between two biscuits periodtoken one of my favorite things to eat periodtoken ever periodtoken your donuts are always a treat commatoken who doesnt like a damn donut maybe a gluten free vegan but what the hell do they like anyway periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  contrary to what i just wrote commatoken i dont really visit anymore periodtoken we got really sick of paying close to 30 to get breakfast from a donut shop that isnt full service periodtoken also commatoken the last time we went there i called in an order and waited in line to get it periodtoken while i was in line commatoken i saw a lady tap a man and his daughter on the shoulder while they were eating their donuts and ask them commatoken excuse me commatoken is that good first of all commatoken let this man enjoy a donut with his child in peace periodtoken secondly commatoken what the hell do you think its a chocolate donut filled with rice pudding periodtoken you like donuts you like chocolate you like rice pudding badda fucking bing bozo its a 2 periodtoken50 investment periodtoken donuts are like a roll in the hay commatoken even when its bad commatoken its good periodtoken   clearly that experience made me realize that my neighborhood donut shop is frequented by tourists with dumb questions and intrusive behavior periodtoken ill probably go back at some point on a slow day commatoken but if anyone interrupts my snarfing session with a dumb question about a glazed donut commatoken ill let one out thats so vile commatoken the whole place will be forced to evacuate periodtoken","7861":"recently attended a weeding and here periodtoken i dont know anything about the price commatoken but it is a pretty nice location and the food was pretty good for a wedding buffet dinner periodtoken the location is right off the 101 which is convenient commatoken but it is right next to the railroad tracks and the the trains going by are very loud and obnoxious periodtoken the outside seating can get chilly commatoken but they do have heat lamps periodtokenlast but certainly commatoken not least periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhalf way through dinner there was an overwhelming odor of sewage that invaded the area for nearly ten minutes periodtoken","7864":"used to be a good pizza for a good price periodtoken  same pizza higher prices periodtoken ill go elsewhere periodtoken","7867":"i have been going here for years and solely for their gyros unfortunately it seems like the quality has gone downhill periodtoken you used to get an overstuffed overflowing pile of meat inside your pita bread and now it seems like there was only about three or four slices in there a small amount of tzatziki and it seemed like the lettuce was slightly a bit bitter periodtoken i understand that the economy is crunching everybody and thank goodness this business is still alive but portions have gone down and quality has gone down","7868":"the band was great and love the ambience not much of beer drinker so u cant judge that by me periodtoken the menu looked and sounded great but the food was not that great periodtoken ive eaten there before and it was good commatoken just not this time periodtoken","7869":"i have no complaints in regards to the food quality periodtoken i do however have a problem in regards to the wait time periodtoken i ordered two items one time and it took almost ten minutes to get out of there periodtoken it was not that busy though periodtoken could do better on time but no other complaints periodtoken","7873":"this location is alright i miss you jerseys by roosevelt periodtoken its located in the shoppes of park place so can be busy depending what time you are there periodtoken usually ample parking on this side of the shopping plaza periodtoken   service is hit or miss the handful of times ive been here periodtoken management is good though in correcting mistakes periodtoken i normally just get a turkey sub mikes way so i cant really speak to any of the other subs here periodtoken you cant really mess up a turkey sub lol periodtoken my son likes the chicken parm and hubby likes the philly cheese steak or the kahuna cheese steak periodtoken","7874":"i gave this joint 3 stars because of the ambience and customer service commatoken but the burgers were okay and definitely not the best i ever had periodtoken","7875":"this market is ok periodtoken its an ok distance from where i live periodtoken its usually pretty clean and organized periodtoken the staff has always been friendly periodtoken love that they have a parking lot the reason for the three stars is for the lack of cashiers during peak daystimes periodtoken","7876":"food was great but service not so periodtoken people are super friendly commatoken but i ordered 3 things and they all came out at the same time periodtoken hot commatoken cold commatoken everything periodtoken it was dead so servers were talking about life commatoken thy great commatoken but they are talking about having to be on antibiotics and how they cant poop and its like thanks guy so appetizing periodtoken foods a 4 to 5 commatoken service needs training on the basics periodtoken give it a try when more busy maybe periodtoken","7877":"we came here on sunday afternoon commatoken it was ok periodtoken  they had a nice variety of tea options commatoken i was underwhelmed by the soup commatoken didnt have much flavor periodtoken  the team sandwiches and pumpkin bread was delicious periodtoken  the listing said it would be a full size scone commatoken i would consider what we received a mini periodtoken  the reason for the 3 start and not a 4 commatoken is that prior to me arriving the groupon was marked as used which confused me because i had not arrived yet periodtoken  i called to make sure there wouldnt be any confusion upon my arrival commatoken someone called me back periodtoken she explained to me as part of there 24 hour rule they mark the groupon as used the day of your appointment commatoken i think this should be done either at the of the day or when the customer is finished their meal periodtoken  if it was done at the end of the day it would reduce the confusion because since mines was done before i even arrived i was questioning the time of my appointment this was not a good customer experience for me periodtoken  if you are going to do it in the morning than perhaps make a phone call the day before to confirm appointments or when the customer makes the appointment you communicate what will be done periodtoken","7879":"was there earlier today latte was great biscuit was microwaved  commatoken employees were less than pleasant periodtoken i couldnt get a hello or anything out of them periodtoken silence is golden at a movie not a coffee shop periodtoken","7882":"definitely an experience i think i have finally realized that custard melts a lot faster than ice cream commatoken so its probably not the best choice for a warm summer night periodtoken   while visiting stl commatoken we headed there on a monday night around 730 periodtoken we only had to wait a few minutes in line periodtoken we all ordered one of the smallest sizes which was plenty periodtoken i ordered mine with the special cookies and devoured it pretty quickly which i needed to in order to avoid it turning to custard soup periodtoken my son was not so lucky and was disappointed that he couldnt eat more of his periodtoken  it was definitely worth the trip for the experience commatoken but im not sure whether it will be worth returning to again periodtoken","7883":"the sushi here  is good however the place smells godawful its almost impossible to eat inside and completely unappetizing periodtoken im a little too mad to go back because i ordered vegitarian sushi to go and they packed it in the same box as my mothers tuna sushi which compromised my entire vegitarian meal as her food was touching mine periodtoken just not acceptable behavior for a vegitarian meal periodtoken","7884":"we went here because of word of mouth periodtoken unfortunately commatoken we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated commatoken and during that time commatoken no one even greeted us periodtoken the food was good commatoken but it certainly wasnt worth raving about periodtoken","7888":"came to get a fresh fruit smoothie after a long night of watching the world series and they took fresh fruit smoothie is off of the menu four months prior periodtoken other than that the place looks legit seemed pretty friendly the woman at the counter was extra friendly considering that i had driven there for fresh fruit smoothie and they took them off the menu ill give this place three stars just for the atmosphere","7890":"this place is packed with people commatoken need to wait almost an hour to get the table periodtoken seems to be the only authentic chinese food place to go near downtown periodtoken the place is decorated well but the quality of the food is so so periodtoken the meat in the dish wasnt very fresh periodtoken","7891":"i guess this is what you would get if applebees did mexican periodtoken it has that very commercial chain feel to it but its overpriced and still a little bit new so it has some kinks to work out in the serving department periodtoken its a pretty restaurant being a little bit more upscale periodtoken my parents complained that we didnt get our own beans and rice commatoken we had to share the beans and rice with the table periodtoken i cannot stand it when a restaurant nickels and dimes you periodtoken given those standards im surprised they didnt charge us for the chips and salsa which were soso periodtoken miguels has better chips and salsa periodtoken  we saw a lot of people on dates there commatoken probably because the movie theater is attached to the same mall but i would happily go to pf changs over besito periodtoken","7892":"i really want to like this place commatoken but i always leave somewhat disappointed periodtoken the biggest issue for me is the menu seems to be designed for vegvegan diners who want to eat more standard nonveg food burgers commatoken bacon commatoken etc periodtoken if thats what youre looking for commatoken then you may really like hcv periodtoken however commatoken this focus tends to favor an emphasis on flavored soybased products over an array of fresh fruits and vegetables periodtoken i think cutting down on the soy heavy meat and chicken imitations and focusing more on fresh vegcentric dishes would go a long way for hcv periodtoken  still commatoken some of their food is pretty good periodtoken the quinoa chili is nice in the winter periodtoken their desserts are great periodtoken the banana whips are a delicious healthy treat commatoken and they have really good vegan cupcakes that they bring in from a local bakery periodtoken also commatoken their staff is typically very friendly periodtoken","7896":"how could this place not have been reviewed yet its an upscale supermarket here in stl commatoken years ago commatoken it was a full step above schnucks markets commatoken but now that we have super schnucks commatoken not so much periodtoken still commatoken i think they are a bit on the pricy side commatoken but no as bad as strabes periodtoken  this particular store is clean and well stocked and parking is never a problem periodtoken i have issues with some of the marketing associated with the meat department commatoken there have been commatoken in my experience commatoken some bait and switch tactics associated with some of the sales they have commatoken any five items for 20 special the meat department has commatoken the often obscure use of special sale tags are confusing and you never know until check out that your paying more than you thought periodtoken  staff outside the meat department is helpful and the lines are never too long periodtoken","7898":"cosi was the breakfast spot of choice this morning after three food trucks suggested by yelp were missing or closed at 715 periodtoken humph periodtoken found cosi on the way back to the sheraton commatoken and jumped at the breakfast sign out front periodtoken yes commatoken as other yelped have noted commatoken similar feel to panera but with a more modern feel periodtoken   santa fe wrap and medium coffee was 5 periodtoken07 periodtoken wrap was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennothing special commatoken but better than other optionswhich were none periodtoken coffee was fine periodtoken some scones commatoken etc periodtoken also were available periodtoken   plenty of seating inside commatoken outside commatoken and upstairs periodtoken  functionality and proximity were the key words for cosi today commatoken but im not sure vibrancy or delectability would apply commatoken based on our brief visit periodtoken","7900":"if youre ordering a coffee drink with espresso commatoken one thing to know is that whether you order regular or large commatoken they put a double shot in periodtoken this means that ordering a large latte just gets you a lot more milk than a regular periodtoken which seems weird periodtoken my husband ordered the nitro coffee which tasted watery and not carbonated at all periodtoken fun atmosphere though and people seem to really like the donuts commatoken so maybe go for that periodtoken","7903":"a little over a year later they closed no warning nothing commatoken they say they are looking for a larger restaurant i find this hard to believe because they really were looking for larger site the tollytown shop a rama sonic location has been vacant for years and would be perfect for what they want they could you drive up service drivethrough service and theres a outdoor seating area but they wont because theyre closing because they suck not because it got too big for the site periodtoken i wish them best of luck with their two other well established restaurants periodtoken","7904":"we visited the restaurant for sunday brunch commatoken and had a nice time periodtoken  the service was somewhat scattered commatoken but the manager worked hard to sort out an issue that came up with regard to our reservation periodtoken  we were seated quickly periodtoken    the complimentary beignets were really good commatoken and otherwise the food was good for this type of restaurant  the price periodtoken  the train station atmosphere is inviting periodtoken  the byob policy was also nice periodtoken","7905":"ive swung by henrys several times to grab my morning joe and occasionally a bite to eat periodtoken i havent been back in awhile and theres a reason why  average periodtoken  ive tried several hot and cold coffee drinks and they underwhelm in comparison to the other local coffee shops periodtoken the food  snacks are pretty good periodtoken  service has always been good periodtoken friendly staff and management periodtoken  i would come back commatoken but wouldnt expect much out of my visit periodtoken","7907":"we were told by several people to give this place a try while we were downtown a few days ago periodtoken its a neat restaurant with cool atmosphere and very friendly service commatoken but i feel like its overrated periodtoken while they claim they have a large draft beer selection and they do commatoken not one beer is recognizable periodtoken the menu wasnt much better  the 11 burger selection is pretty out there and they dont come with any sides commatoken those are ordered separately periodtoken after eating we all said it was nothing outstanding and we agreed the fries were the best part of the entire meal periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and they were just fries commatoken nothing special themselves periodtoken the experience wasnt entirely regretful commatoken but we will not be back periodtoken","7908":"came here for drinks with my family  still think the menu is subpar periodtoken i believe they have a seasonal menu because things i remember ordering the first time are not listed periodtoken at least this time i was coming for the beer periodtoken between us all we tried many different beers  not one of us was disappointed periodtoken also commatoken i did order a side of wedges  it did consist of more than four in case anyone was curious","7915":"came in specifically to buy a vanilla cake with butter cream frosting periodtoken   the lady sold me a 12 in double layer cake and said it would feed 18 to 20 ppl commatoken cost me over  50 periodtoken  when i picked up this huge cake commatoken a different lady said it would feed up to  35 periodtoken  i was a little disappointed because i didnt need so much commatoken but was excited to eat this cake periodtoken   they did make a mistake on the colors i wanted for the cake commatoken but i stuck around and they were able to fix it with ease periodtoken   my expectations commatoken i guess commatoken were pretty high because of all of the reviews and i was really let down periodtoken   it was really just ok periodtoken  there was absolutely nothing amazing about this cake periodtoken   i had leftovers of course and was going to freeze it because they informed me that their cakes freeze well commatoken and i thought commatoken for what  so i tossed the rest of it periodtoken    during my visit commatoken i also bought a carmel pecan apple pie commatoken choco chip and oatmeal cookies commatoken an oreo cupcake and blueberry muffins periodtoken  i had to try the lot periodtoken   the pie was amazing and im not a pie person periodtoken   the cookies were awesome  chewy center wcrisp edges periodtoken  the cupcake commatoken muffins and cake was where it felt way short for myself and the other 6 members of my family periodtoken   these like items were all spongy commatoken not very moist and crumby periodtoken  even the kid didnt care to eat all of his slice of cake periodtoken  great pie and cookies probably isnt enough to get me to be a frequent costomer periodtoken  but the customer service was good commatoken  they had my order done on time and its a convenient location periodtoken   im sure they will continue to do a great business commatoken but it was just a little over rated for me periodtoken","7917":"i am not a huge fan of burger king periodtoken  im really not periodtoken  but sometimes commatoken when you have kids commatoken grandkids commatoken a full time job commatoken school and 25 hours worth of things to do in a 24 hour day commatoken sometimes commatoken its a necessary evil periodtoken  ive never been in this particular burger king before commatoken however commatoken it was right near main street and we were at the new port richey christmas parade with the little ones periodtoken  when a four year old starts tugging on your shirt whining gramma commatoken i gots to peeeeeee periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken commatoken you head for the nearest bathroom commatoken no questions asked periodtoken  we were all starving any way commatoken so hey periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhy not  thankfully enough commatoken a clean bathroom and playground are the highlights here periodtoken  but commatoken you know commatoken its still burger king on a saturday night periodtoken  so commatoken swarms of teenagers and always some inconsiderate fool who has no problem smoking in the playground in front of other peoples children periodtoken  the area is clearly marked no smoking commatoken but invariably gets ignored by the inconsiderate inhabitants getting their fast food fix on periodtoken  while this bk is clean and nice commatoken i feel i must minus a star because management refuses to speak up to the rude customers who insist on lighting up in the playground in front of the children and those of us who prefer clean air with our onion rings periodtoken  i have nothing against smokers periodtoken  honestly periodtoken  if you want to kill yourself by smoking commatoken thats fine periodtoken  no issue periodtoken  theyre your lungs commatoken but innocent kids shouldnt have to breathe it in periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand management should protect their littlest customers periodtoken its sort of in their best interest periodtoken  kind of hard to order food when your clientele all have oxygen masks on from lung cancer periodtoken    however commatoken if you have to stop in periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenits not the worst place in pasco to stop for a quickie snack periodtoken  and commatoken lets be real periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey sell cinnabon cinnamon rolls periodtoken  2 in

best periodtoken its fast food that takes some time periodtoken their food is somewhat greasy commatoken such as the crazy roll commatoken or somethign that deals with spice periodtoken for some reason the spicy sauce is oily and leaves a bad after taste periodtoken  but i do recommend their udon commatoken periodtoken its at a good price and it cant go wrong periodtoken pair that with spicy tuna doesnt use the sauce mentioned above","7920":"lots of potential here commatoken but a lack of preparation for the insane crowds that came out meant many folks went away hungry periodtoken    this event  which i heartily hope will return to east passyunk again in a more robust form commatoken with lots and lots more vendors  was just a victim of its own outsized buzz periodtoken  bloggers commatoken the twitterati and every hungry hipster in the vicinity came out commatoken with their dogs and babies periodtoken  i laughed out loud when i saw the line for tacos  you can walk two blocks in any direction from passyunk  tasker and get 3 for 5 periodtoken    hopefully the food trust learned they need to scale this event up if they actually want to feed anyone periodtoken the interest is certainly there","7923":"update i deducted a star because they no longer offer their white peach pear iced tea we moved to london for work so i guess i missed the memo periodtoken unaware commatoken we went for breakfast when we were in town a few weeks ago periodtoken as soon as we were seated i ordered my what i thought was going to be first of many white peach pear iced tea periodtoken big smile on my face  london has great hot tea but crap iced tea periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou really have to make it yourself usually over here periodtoken at any rate  denied periodtoken  waitress uh we dont have that any more periodtoken  me checking the menu in disbelief commatoken mouth agape in horror what  her yeah commatoken like commatoken i dont know why they did it periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was really popular periodtoken  me suspicious it might actually be my own fault given how many refills i always ordered and how often we frequented turning point yeah commatoken doesnt make sense  my husband impatient and not trying to be helpful despite whatever he says just order something else me withering glare putting him on notice periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthinking that iced tea is the only reason i come to turning point so often you order first  after trial and error i found you can order the available as hot only white orchard tea with two accompanying glasses of ice and make your own periodtoken but commatoken hell commatoken i might as well be eating breakfast in london slopping the whole table up with tea drippings and condensation periodtoken plus i miss the pure joy of having a perfect white peach pear iced tea in a takeaway cup to savor while my husband is dawdling his way across home depot or something periodtoken so yeah commatoken turning point  one less star periodtoken take that","7925":"okay periodtoken second try periodtoken first try i checked in because i was here but we didnt order anything cause it was bumping on a friday night and we needed to get somewhere for that night periodtoken saturday night periodtoken still bumping periodtoken this has to be good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it has to live up to its hype periodtoken  so the question youre all wondering periodtoken periodtoken was it worth the hype in all honesty commatoken it was okay periodtoken walking in commatoken the line situation was something thats really noticeable periodtoken at first you think its because this place is amazing commatoken then once you pass those second pair of doors commatoken you know why it goes out the door periodtoken the counter where you order is right next to the door periodtoken i think they could have planned that out a little better commatoken or at least place the register somewhere else so it doesnt get in the way of just people waiting in line or people going in and out to serve people periodtoken   anyways commatoken enough about the hypeness periodtoken whats up with the food i ordered i believe 4 or 5 tacos periodtoken the ones that stood out in my mouth was the southern fried taco periodtoken  which tacos did i order southern fried taco korean bbq taco smoked brisket i believe the local bbq i want to say the tequila lime chicken taco commatoken but i cant be positive periodtoken  i know commatoken i know periodtoken youre probably wondering why im even writing this if i dont even remember exactly what i ate periodtoken its because they werent all that great periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken nothing really stood out in my mind except the southern fried taco periodtoken so commatoken my advice if youre going to order any taco commatoken get that one periodtoken the other ones werent that amazing periodtoken the korean bbq taco commatoken i ate about half of it before i got the taste of the bbq part periodtoken also commatoken i dont think there was just enough meat in the taco itself periodtoken   theres a lot of seating periodtoken indoor and outdoor periodtoken well commatoken indoor during winter is going to be limited commatoken however commatoken the seating outside is under a canopy periodtoken so its not the best place to sit as far as insulation wise commatoken but its still a place to sit if its needed periodtoken  all in all commatoken its alright periodtoken i enjoyed the food commatoken mostly periodtoken but the one piece of advice from me if you do come here to eat commatoken get the southern fried taco periodtoken you wont be disappointed periodtoken","7928":"sad disappointment periodtoken shake was amazing and food is probably good but that doesnt make up for wait time periodtoken i waited so long for my food and when it came out some things were hot some where cold periodtoken hence kitchen staff lacks timing skills or expediter was to quick on draw periodtoken they gave me a greek salad with no dressing some food that didnt belong to me and water downed sauce for my falafel that tasted like old oil periodtoken","7937":"as a huge fan of italia pizza due to their vegan cheese and glutenfree crust offerings commatoken i havent ordered any pizza from castrillos due to this periodtoken however commatoken due to my mischief and affection for malbec the previous evening commatoken castrillos was now an option due to their delivery service periodtoken it should also be notated that i only live 2 blocks away periodtoken i was not going to peel myself off the couch today  i was stoked to find out that they were able to accommodate my vegan requests by serving up spaghetti with marinara sauce commatoken dry breadsticks commatoken and a salad sans cheese periodtoken the food was filling and hit the spot and was delivered in under 45 minutes periodtoken i am curious to try the vegetarian sandwich but am bummed that pizza doesnt appear to be in my near future periodtoken  service was friendly commatoken fast commatoken and the daily specials offered on the website are enticing periodtokentheir prices are quite reasonable i was leaning towards 4 stars but would like to try a few other items on the menu before i can commit to that periodtoken hopefully commatoken some vegan cheese will be on their menu soon i will definitely order up from castrillos again periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlets hope that i can actually have the energy to do carryout next time","7938":"upland nachos are very good and plenty for everyone periodtoken ordered pork and chicken periodtoken just the right temperature periodtoken 2 pints on sunday

sloooow periodtoken pretty much not an option for a business lunch because you cant get in and out quickly periodtoken  also commatoken dont look up periodtoken  those hanging window decorations awesome but dirty dust balls hanging off of them periodtoken  yuck periodtoken","7940":"typical cracker barrel periodtoken was here for breakfast periodtoken their breakfast is my favorite periodtoken

suspicious of the goat cheese this time around and actually took it off after eating 12 the sandwich periodtoken obviously i have no idea for sure it was the sandwich but once i was rid of whatever it was commatoken i was fine periodtoken everything just tasted ok commatoken this time periodtoken hoping this was a fluke and my first impression will keep this place thriving periodtoken","7944":"beautiful commatoken clean but commatoken regrettably commatoken noisy periodtoken  nice room commatoken overlooking courtyard commatoken clean and lovely periodtoken  really good complimentary breakfast periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken it was as if the walls to outside were made of paper periodtoken you could hear a lot of noise periodtoken  if you are a partyer commatoken this may not be a problem periodtoken but we are middle aged and getting up early to sightsee commatoken so we needed our sleep periodtoken they told me they usually clear everyone out of the courtyard by 12 midnight or so periodtoken  wow commatoken had no idea periodtoken  its possible that rooms not facing the courtyard are not as loud periodtoken  if it were not for this i would have given it 5 stars periodtoken  but for what we paid commatoken this was too much periodtoken","7945":"3 periodtoken5 stars had our first beignet and chicory coffee here and loved it service was excellent commatoken extremely friendly periodtoken  tried blt and a cowboy burger periodtoken the blt was loaded with bacon and tasted fine periodtoken burger was a little over cooked but the bbq

periodtoken  we felt like we were troubling the hostess or doing her a favor by being here periodtoken  our server wasnt much better periodtoken  our table was wonky and we asked him to put a beer mat under one of the legs periodtoken  he gave us a look like we were insane and said he would do it and then didnt even attempt it periodtoken  we did it ourselves in the end periodtoken  he offered refills on my husbands coke but didnt notice my water was empty periodtoken  it took about half an hour for the food to come out but it was decent periodtoken  hubby got the chicken mole enchiladas and he grew up in socal breathing mexican food  and he thought they were solid periodtoken  i had half spinach salad half avocado salad and a side of black beans and they were all good periodtoken  would have given it 4 stars for food but with slow and marginal service it only gets 3 periodtoken  would prob come back if there werent so many other good places to eat close by

periodtokenok commatoken its not bad but everyone that works there had the same favorite try the question periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken im curious now periodtoken commatoken commatoken  i wish i could say all the desserts were great periodtoken  trust me after five years i should have a favorite commatoken right nope periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken still looking for something other than the baklava periodtoken  when pressed i will agree the baklava cheesecake isnt bad commatoken and the tiramisu is also pretty good periodtoken  the cupcakes are awful commatoken how can that even be in any case i still keep going back looking for the elusive pastry that will capture my heart periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken enjoy the search  its a fun place regardless and a true tarpon

super reasonable i usually split the meal with someone periodtoken the chicken katsu and the gyoza are my usually choices for the ricemeat bowl that they serve with the lunch special periodtoken  quality here wavers commatoken some days its better than others and i wish i could rate sushiya 3 periodtoken5 overall periodtoken but you get what you pay for most rolls cost between 9 and 13 periodtoken they also offer mochi as dessert at a dollar each which is ridiculous periodtoken  but yea commatoken lunch special great everything else commatoken meh periodtoken","7959":"i think i was expecting something more here and because i was commatoken i need to go back and try them again periodtoken  the concept is just a good tasting simple hamburger but i thought i would be getting something more substantial commatoken but the price does reflect what you get periodtoken  it may be that i need to get 2 of these at a time to fairly compare their offerings to other food trucks periodtoken  it is a good tasting burger so do try them out periodtoken  just writing what i am thinking here periodtoken","7963":"disappointed periodtoken food okay periodtoken clerks clueless periodtoken i got charged for a small cheese pizza in addition to my order by a newbie cashier periodtoken when i pointed out the error commatoken a more senior employee suggested she refund the overage in cash periodtoken fine enough but she didnt think to tell her how to cancel the kitchen order periodtoken out comes two pizzas periodtoken and she refunded me less than its cost commatoken on review of events periodtoken so her cash drawer will be way off and they wasted a small cheese pizza periodtoken my suggestion keep an eye on them commatoken especially if everyone seems to be in training","7964":"basically commatoken this is a convenience store that sells food along with cigarillos and condoms periodtoken great reviews convinced me to give it a try periodtoken  visited at 630pm periodtoken after we paid commatoken the owner brought our butter chicken after about 15 minutes commatoken apologizing that he had run out of rice and so gave four extra pieces of naan

perhaps my next house will be around the corner from a fruit stand or farmers marketthat may be a little easier on my waistline periodtoken  ok commatoken ok commatoken now i have to divulge that i am 8 months pregnantso i think that makes me a very credible frozen custard and ice cream critic periodtoken bottom line commatoken ted drewes commatoken please stop being skimpy on the toppings

periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou can handle it","7981":"not a lot of tables for seating and the wait is long periodtoken the flavors are unique and crafty periodtoken i can see why theres so much hype for this trendy place  but if you just want a quick sweet treat better off getting a frosty at wendys across the street periodtoken if you dont mind waiting get a cutesy little ice smile

tender periodtoken  i had the harlem style chicken  waffles the fried chicken was tasty with crispy skin commatoken although the waffles themselves were just okay they were a too soft for my taste

periodtoken50 periodtoken say what i get it commatoken the price of meat has gone up periodtoken but thats a pretty steep increase periodtoken especially since i need to eat 4 of those little tacos to really feel full commatoken it puts the price of a meal over 11 periodtoken00 periodtoken guess this is going to turn into a rare occasion kind of meal for me periodtoken instead of a havetohaveit kind of meal periodtoken","7996":"yeah periodtoken i like this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken its pretty average commatoken but also pretty reasonable and decent periodtoken it has a super

i see it more of a lunch atmosphere for dinning in commatoken but they have added beer and wine to improve this i believe periodtoken the staff has their highs and lows in terms of customer service commatoken but we keep coming back for the consistency of the pizza periodtoken","8008":"i purchased four of the small square cakes to sample as i hadnt been to swiss haus since chef jim took over in 2008 periodtoken  while the quality has improved im still not a fan of thin slices of cake surrounded by generous amounts of sweet commatoken fluffy icing which would be a mouse if it was thicker in consistency and probably a product that i would more enjoy periodtoken  the carrot cake was more to my liking  lots of nuts and a nice cream cheese icing periodtoken  i would imagine that the strawberry shortcake is a winner based on the style of many of their other cakes periodtoken  the service was good friendly and helpful  my friend and i stopped in a bit after 5p on a wednesday periodtoken","8010":"i have no major issues with apollos periodtoken its close to home and the service is generally always on point periodtoken ive eaten through here numerous times over the years and

periodtoken periodtoken","8026":"great service commatoken quick and efficient periodtoken bison burger was great and sweet potato fries done well periodtoken  three stars because my kale salad had cashews instead of roasted hazelnuts and dried cranberries instead of dried cherries and i wasnt informed of the change i had never been here before so i thought i had mixed up two salads and ordered the wrong one periodtoken when i double checked later on for sure had different ingredients than listed on the menu periodtoken didnt worry about sending back the salad was fine but not a 10 salad for sure periodtoken","8027":"this place definitely feeds into that overhype for a restaurant in which the ambiance is cute but the seating is limited the food is pretty but only good and not deserving

the chicken in garlic sauce chicken and unfortunately because it was so salty periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni mean periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenreally salty i like salt normally

there was not enough air for the space or the volume periodtoken i was also unimpressed by the burgers periodtoken the price is high 912 per burger and this does not include anything except a burger commatoken homemade ketchup which i did not care for and a pickle which was exquisite periodtoken also they ask you how you would like your burger cooked periodtoken if it is ground meat there should not be any redpink periodtoken so naturally to avoid getting sick i asked for medium well periodtoken my burger was dry and lacking in taste overall i choose the special smoke and fire periodtoken my dates burger was slightly better he got the american but i was still not won over especially for the price periodtoken  now to the good periodtoken the wait staff was friendly and attentive not so much the host periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut that might be attributed to the heat periodtoken the drinks were superb i got the sweet raspberry ice tea and was blown away and my date enjoyed

prices periodtoken the scrambled eggs skillet was the highlight of my meal periodtoken the pancakes were dry and not fluffy commatoken and made worse by the cheap syrup in the super sticky bottle

 the coconut cake has a nice flavor commatoken but i found the cake to be very dense and compacted periodtoken  for the price i expected to love the cakes and crave to come back commatoken not the

whole bunch of fries after im done my burger i wish theyd charge less and give less fries periodtoken on to the 9 burger periodtoken it was okay but fell short in so many ways commatoken and thats ultimately why this place only gets 3 stars periodtoken it seemed to lack seasoning as there was little taste to the burger periodtoken the bottom bun had also gotten soggy and flat from the other ingredients and sort of fell apart in my hand as i was grasping the burger periodtoken for whatever reason commatoken the pork roll didnt add much to the already unseasoned burger periodtoken wouldve maybe been better if there were two pork rolls on the double burger commatoken and if the beef patties were seasoned more thoroughly with at least salt and pepper periodtoken i could not even taste salt commatoken at all periodtoken i wanted to fall in love with the burger so badly commatoken but the lack of flavor each time i took a bite was just so disheartening periodtoken id like to give this place a try when im having another cheat meal in a week or two i hope my next experience will be better and that this was just a oneoff periodtoken","8105":"im stuck between 3 and 4 stars periodtoken its a 5oz burger commatoken and for 6 bucks commatoken you can get more meat elsewhere commatoken but whats really going for them are their ingredients periodtoken beautiful roll commatoken letuce tomato commatoken and especially the meat periodtoken like a good steak commatoken the first bite had that blood red greese dripping onto the parchment not too greesey overall periodtoken its pretty much a classic allamerican burger joint with minimal offerings of shakes and fries periodtoken   this is definitely a lunch place but as good as the burgers are commatoken i cant afford a 10 lunch most days periodtoken a good tip a friend gave me was that an order of fries are quite ample periodtoken so go with a friend commatoken get two burgers and a fry to share periodtoken  i wish it blew my mind commatoken but it didnt periodtoken its a solid hamburger though periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8110":"not what i expected periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken first time to tarpon springs periodtoken very touristy area commatoken and in addition to sponges you could buy everywhere commatoken lots of the usual tourist tees commatoken magnets commatoken glasses commatoken etc periodtoken the hellas has a nice looking bakery if you are looking for sugar and gluten periodtoken we were there for the greek food at lunch time periodtoken the place was packed commatoken and it was huge commatoken noisy commatoken dark commatoken and bustling periodtoken the menu had dolmas commatoken spanokapitas commatoken and other goodies commatoken but as dinner plates commatoken not as appetizers commatoken and they were a little pricey periodtoken their combo plate was close to 20 commatoken also a little much for lunch periodtoken we settled on gyros commatoken classic greek periodtoken well commatoken if you are into lots of meat commatoken this is the sandwich for you periodtoken it was big commatoken wrapped in a yummy warm pita commatoken but had very little of what adds flavor to the dryness of the lambbeef rotisserie periodtoken very little onion commatoken lettuce commatoken tomato periodtoken i had to ask for more tzatziki sauce periodtoken what came out was basically a thick sour cream periodtoken very little of the yogurt commatoken garlic commatoken cuke flavor that you expect periodtoken really im used to juices running down my arm periodtoken this was kind of  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken boring periodtoken meat periodtoken meat periodtoken more meat periodtoken the couple next to us had ordered a soup commatoken concluding ive had better greek soup than this periodtoken it wasnt bad commatoken it just wasnt what you expect coming to a town with the greek reputation ts has periodtoken ive had much better in gulf breeze florida near pensacola beach i want garlic breath   worth a try if you like gyro meat commatoken youre in luck","8114":"we were looking forward to a nice dinner at tre lune for our anniversary periodtoken unfortunately we were very disappointed periodtoken our waitperson was very cold and abrupt with our service periodtoken there was simply zero interaction periodtoken if this was a diner i would overlook this but not a restaurant serving a community such as montecito periodtoken","8117":"the pizza was good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken not the best i have had seemed like too much sauce and not enough cheese periodtoken but i do have to say i had it delivered and they were at my house before the online time said it would be commatoken and it was still hot periodtoken all in all ill still order from here periodtoken","8119":"the only thing i liked about this place was the taro boba tea which im obsessed with anything taro periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni probably need an intervention but thats for another conversation periodtoken periodtoken the pad thai was mediocre and i dont want no mediocre periodtoken ill come back for the boba periodtoken","8121":"basically commatoken if you want to buy some cupcakes to go commatoken pretty good spot  5 stars commatoken but pretty pricey for a togo activity periodtoken if you want to sit down and eat a cupcake with one other adult friend commatoken also a 5 star activity commatoken but worth the money bc of the cute shop and experience periodtoken  with that said commatoken my experience bringing children 1 star there is no part of this place that is kid friendly and i dont have kids  just nieces and nephews  so that doesnt usually bother me commatoken but i wanted to bring my nieces here for their birthdays and only realized once i got here that it was a terrible idea commatoken which sucked bc i dont really know too many adults who want to sit down and share a cupcake in a cupcake store periodtoken   children cant see the high display of cupcakes unless you pick them up periodtoken because of our group three adults two babies and a four year old commatoken there was only one part of the shop that we could all fit periodtoken bar chairs and tables  cant sit on and hold a baby at the same time periodtoken the four year old needed help getting up and down off of the chair commatoken and constant vigilance bc a fall off of the bar stool wouldve been a disaster periodtoken the four year old was also thirsty and infused water is cute for adults but kids think its disgusting periodtoken the paper dixie cups dont hold enough water  even for the four year old commatoken and not having a top on them sometimes ends in wet situations luckily not this day periodtoken then there wasnt anymore water commatoken and you cant eat a cupcake when your mouth is dry  meltdown periodtoken so sorry to the workers and other patrons for that periodtoken my sis and i had to inhale the cupcakes commatoken and we took the kids cupcakes to go periodtoken im not giving up on this place commatoken but rearranging the shop a little to have more seating for groups larger than two and closer to the ground commatoken making sure theres water easily available with cups larger than shot glasses commatoken and figuring out a better way to display the goods for all sizes of people wouldve made our experience really enjoyable commatoken rather than resulting in the kind of story i tell my boyfriend when he talks about wanting kids periodtoken  previous experience 5 stars i went here 15min before closing commatoken so naturally i figured i was going to get a dried out crusty cupcake because it was the end of the day periodtoken nope periodtoken i didnt ask when they made it commatoken but it was super moist and delicious commatoken and exactly what i wanted at the time periodtoken great service periodtoken great selection periodtoken i left very happy periodtoken","8122":"ok i get it donuts are great commatoken nice to be able to get a parking periodtoken service is friendly and place is cool periodtoken but 2 periodtoken50 for a donut 20 for a dozen at least offer a free cup of coffee with that dozen periodtoken  i hear the chicken is awesome but i was in such shock after my donut tab i had to go sit down and regroup periodtoken next time ill get chicken but definitely skip the donut periodtoken","8123":"i used to work at this shop and save a long time ago in a galaxy far away commatoken well thats what it seems like  when i stopped in here to pick up a couple of things for dinner periodtoken  i hadnt been in this location for quite some time commatoken years in fact and after my last visit i am sure its going to be years more before i return periodtoken  while i navigated around the store i kept noticing the difference in appearance it looked from the years i worked there commatoken the store was clean however i didnt find the employees to be that friendly nor helpful periodtoken   i was able to find what i was looking for however i wasnt expecting to stand in a line for about 15 minutes waiting to check out periodtoken there was only 3 lines open commatoken and only one of the express self checkouts was in operation periodtoken  i did see one cashier still working there from the days when i was there however she was so over the place and looked like she had had enough commatoken i didnt even bother talking to her to find out how things were compared to when we worked together commatoken because it was obvious periodtoken  i tend to stay away from shop and saves and now after this last visit i will stay away for good and just stick to my schnucks where  know i will get  treated good and have a satisfying shopping experience periodtoken","8126":"3500 winehaus is a nice local wine bar and a welcomed addition to the neighborhood periodtoken they have two outdoor areas commatoken a front patio and a back patio periodtoken both are covered and heated in the cool weather months periodtoken they also have a small wine bar inside and a couple of sofas periodtoken  service seems to be the biggest drawback periodtoken if you come with a group commatoken it will throw them off periodtoken additionally commatoken they get a little pissy if they seat you outside and you go to the bar for service commatoken even if you are not getting served in a timely manner and table service is inadequate periodtoken also commatoken dont go hungry periodtoken they only have cheese and sausage plates to offer periodtoken no upscale cheese and meat choices periodtoken very basic periodtoken  my only other complaint is that there are no high top tables periodtoken the bar is small and the rest of the seating is low periodtoken they would do really well if they added a substantial amount of high tops so that people can mingle a bit periodtoken especially since they dont have much room in the bar periodtoken  overall commatoken its a nice place commatoken but i will not be there often because i am social and like to mingle in a wine bar and its not really set up for that periodtoken","8127":"well commatoken now that they have gotten more popular so i guess they think its safe to cut back a bit less meat commatoken less bread commatoken and omg commatoken its mostly iceberg lettuce now periodtoken  do i still its worth it  definitely periodtoken  i guess im a little spoiled because i was there when they were first opened commatoken the servings were much better commatoken and they used romaine lettuce only periodtoken  the meat on the spit could be better periodtoken  el greco is a greek place in sarasota periodtoken  they have meat on spit as well but somehow theirs doesnt look dried out on the spit periodtoken  you can see because its visible from the window as you walk by the restaurant periodtoken  love the staff","8129":"ok commatoken so love that there was a dog to greet us upon entry so friendly we went up to bar and the lady was very informative periodtoken she gave everyone a sample of every beer they had on tap periodtoken i periodtoken didnt get any since i was driving periodtoken i tasted some of my husbands though and really only liked two of them periodtoken you can buy bullets which is 32oz bottles as carry out commatoken but you couldnt drink there otherwise periodtoken i found it strange commatoken but it is just a tasting room periodtoken they did have some pretty creative names for their beers that were for next week periodtoken makes me want to go back just to try them","8130":"40 minute ticket time on a callin order with a 15 minute estimate periodtoken no apology periodtoken i get that youre busy commatoken just be honest about it periodtoken","8135":"we waited outside for a hot minute periodtoken and was not worth the wait periodtoken server was great periodtoken seafood etouffe was good boo fries decent  periodtoken char grilled oysters were a 6 out of 10 periodtoken felixs accross the street is better if you know what to order periodtoken","8136":"my family and i have been going here for a long time periodtoken  they have a consistent wait staff who are always very polite commatoken it depends on when you go for fresh food periodtoken  the sat periodtoken 10 lunch or lunch time is the best value periodtoken   ive had one bad experience but we went back and they were super nice and accommodating to us periodtoken","8142":"i was really looking forward to trying this place today periodtoken even though they just opened commatoken i thought i would give them a chance periodtoken it got off to a rocky start when we arrived at 11 am and they were still prepping the restaurant for service periodtoken people mopping the floors periodtoken etc periodtoken nothing like being really hungry and smelling cleaning solutions periodtoken i have only had poke at poke loa commatoken so i am not an expert commatoken but to me momos poke ingredients are just strange periodtoken carrots radishes and they were kind of stingy with them periodtoken the toppings at poke loa are way yummier periodtoken the pork ramen dish was pretty good i will say periodtoken and the spicy pork dumplings appetizer was pretty good as well periodtoken another knock would be that our waitress smelled like an ashtray periodtoken also commatoken management should let the waitresses know that patrons do not want to hear their personal stories about their lives while they are trying to enjoy lunch periodtoken it was a constant yapping session periodtoken   i will definitely come back for the ramen periodtoken i would never get the poke again periodtoken and i would like to try some other appetizers periodtoken the place has only been open for a little while commatoken so i do expect things to get better periodtoken","8143":"deeply disappointed that this once vegetarian restaurant has started serving meat periodtoken at the same time commatoken food quality in general seems to have taken a dip periodtoken i am grateful they still serve some vegan dishes commatoken but things there have not changed for the better periodtoken","8144":"so new spot for katie and some rough patches periodtoken flatbread pizza with salume beddu had so much lemon it was inedible and bitter arugula spoiled the delicacy of capellini periodtoken artichoke salad delicious and wait staff commatoken though harried commatoken competent periodtoken why however would prominent southeast window look out on trash containers eeesh periodtoken put up one of teds paintings","8145":"had brunch and i must say that the website sold me in coming here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken been awhiles since i had a hearty frenchy type of meal and it was definitely tempting periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but i dunno  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  prices were fairly appropriate periodtoken um commatoken from the ghini delights commatoken for those who are watchin their weight periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken kudos their provencale must say their hash browns were mighty yummy commatoken a lil overboard with butter commatoken but it was oh commatoken so damn yummy and their bread was excellent mmm  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken awesome bread   another downer uncomfy chairs periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  anyhoo commatoken overall commatoken it would be an average of a 2 star but i will say that the bathroom made me give ghini an extra star  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   ladies  dont fret a handy tampon tray that always come in handy  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken excellent for those who are being punished with mother nature periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  you on a date scope mouth wash with cute lil cups to rinse your mouth and more periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken did i ever tell you i carry around a bottle of mouth wash in my car too  yes commatoken my ex was a dentist so id be super paranoid in having my breath stink even though i truly believe mouth wash is for cheaters periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but doesnt hurt to have an eatery with mouthwash periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   now commatoken for the bathroom downers periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this is just  my own personal preference  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken whats up with having the toilet paper roll across from you i dont know about you all commatoken but i sure dont like getting up and having my

nothing to write mother about","8147":"i also used the coupon in this app for the free appetizer periodtoken the value is 9 so if you want the nachos youll pay 2 for that periodtoken  while not that busy commatoken service was slow which seems a common problem periodtoken we ordered the whole shebang platter which included all their meats and four sides periodtoken the brisket was on par with salt and smokes fatty periodtoken commatoken in other words great periodtoken the sausage was cold commatoken same with the pulled pork periodtoken the ribs were very good commatoken nice pull commatoken but very tender periodtoken there was also sliced turkey commatoken periodtoken several very tasty sauces periodtoken as to the side commatoken baked beans just average periodtoken cole slaw was micro chopped commatoken if you catch my drift periodtoken very strange periodtoken green beans were average the fried potatoes were very good periodtoken my wifes crown royal with a splash of soda was 10 commatoken pricey in my opinion periodtoken this is not an inexpensive place periodtoken  periodtoken  periodtoken","8149":"a regular stop on our errand circuit and a godsend during the winter months periodtoken   the positives are the generally good prices commatoken the regular appearance of high end items such as black garlic commatoken purple asparagus commatoken figs and heirloom tomatoes commatoken  the sizable  array of chilis and peppers and the lovely commatoken fresh flowers periodtoken   a concrete example of pjs great pricing  three bunches of cilantro for 2 versus one bunch for 1 periodtoken99 at tanners periodtoken     the downsides are the divided fruit and vegetable counters forcing a shopper to stand in multiple lines commatoken the uneven produce quality some items appear to be seconds and unreliable inventory cant rely on any particular item being in stock and the cashonly sale terms periodtoken  i also dont love the fact that you cant select your own fruit and veggies prebagged and the absence of scales so you can check the weight of items periodtoken","8151":"my boyfriend and i had a groupon periodtoken we didnt have to drive long to find a street parking periodtoken this is an adorable little corner location periodtoken  my boyfriend has the moles enchiladas and had the eggplant vegetarian dish periodtoken the mole enchiladas were a traditional hispanic dish commatoken and it brought back memories of studying abroad in costa rica periodtoken the eggplant dish was poorly seasoned with little to know flavor periodtoken in addition commatoken it was really hot and ice cold in other places commatoken which was confusing periodtoken however commatoken the eggplant was well cooked and not mushy periodtoken also commatoken it had a beautiful presentation   why the three stars this is a small location and my boyfriend and i went at the end of october periodtoken we sat next to the door because that was the only spot opened periodtoken there was a party in the upstairs room and the wait staff kept opening and closing the door allowing cold air in and the people arriving at the party kept the door open constantly too periodtoken i asked for caf\u00e9 de olla despite being eight oclock at night because i was frozen periodtoken i told the waiter i was very cold and so was my boyfriend periodtoken he said he would try to keep the door open commatoken which didnt happen periodtoken my boyfriend got up several times to shut the door periodtoken the waiter also forgot the coffee periodtoken so commatoken i was annoyed and my boyfriend felt bad periodtoken the food was fairly good periodtoken but commatoken the atmosphere of the meal took away from it leaving it disappointing periodtoken","8152":"so disappointed periodtoken fries overlooked periodtoken burger undercooked periodtoken ordered an egg on my burger and it was runny which made the bottom bun useless periodtoken","8153":"i like this place more as a local experience than an italian market periodtoken most cities have an italian store such as mazzaros periodtoken imported sauces commatoken olives commatoken cheeses and meats are sold along with prepared foods and made to order sandwiches periodtoken what makes mazzaros unique is the hordes of customers periodtoken as in every other local place the people are  exceptionally polite and patient periodtoken   at the sandwich counter you take a number and despite the hovering crowd you are amazed when your number is called almost as soon as you dispensed it periodtoken but it is only to take your order periodtoken you then join the waiting crowd periodtoken after a lengthy wait you receive your sub wrapped in butcher paper periodtoken then a wait at one of two cashiers periodtoken   there are shelves and coolers  crammed with anything remotely italian commatoken a coffee counter commatoken a screened in patio and a few outdoor tables periodtoken those on work lunch hours somehow find a place to eat periodtoken    on my recent visit i had the number 2 which is called the italian anywhere else periodtoken  both the soft salami and the provolone were tightly rolled and placed in the middle of the bread periodtoken the italian cole slaw needs vinegar and the tomato and lettuce were hardly noticed periodtoken more dressing and the ingredients layered rather than rolled may have improved this sandwich periodtoken as it was each mouthful was of too cold provolone and too cold genoa salami or just bread periodtoken the bread is so chewy my jaw got tired and i had to store the sandwich in the refrig for later periodtoken not my favorite sub by any means periodtoken at 5 it is really hard to complain periodtoken i think the hot sandwiches i have had are much better periodtoken","8160":"i always do mobile orders commatoken so that way as im on my way to work i can just pick it up commatoken no wait periodtoken i usually order about 15 minutes before im actually there commatoken and it says say itll be ready in 56 minutes periodtoken its literally never ready periodtoken most of the time they havent even started it periodtoken i understand if theyre extremely busy commatoken but every single time commatoken totally defeats the purpose on mobile orders periodtoken","8166":"parking is usually not a problem commatoken but sometimes it is if caseys is packed periodtoken prices vary commatoken but look for salesthere can be some good ones periodtoken customer service has been good for me over the years periodtoken store is pretty easy to navigate periodtoken the pharmacy gets backed up from time to time periodtoken","8167":"this review is a really tough one to write periodtoken there are two aspects to this store the selling of brewing equipment and their outward commatoken servicey aspect periodtoken  for the gear commatoken id like to rate a little lower commatoken maybe two stars periodtoken their cardinal sin running out of liquid malt extract periodtoken honestly commatoken we quit shopping for supplies here bc three times in a row commatoken they were out of pale lme periodtoken that stuff is pretty common and commatoken additionally commatoken the dry me is super expensive anywhere you buy it periodtoken its so common commatoken itd be like a grocery store running out of bread periodtoken they also dont have an amazing selection of hops and yeast often commatoken they are out of some varieties periodtoken  on the other hand commatoken they regularly host free beer tastings from local and out of state breweries commatoken put on a great show commatoken organize food trucks commatoken and have a quaint little tap room with 45 rotating taps periodtoken this part makes me wish i lived down the street  so commatoken there you go commatoken three stars is the compromise periodtoken i dont want these guys to go away commatoken i just want them to up their game in terms of sales  stock periodtoken","8171":"had an early dinner with my friend here a few weeks ago periodtoken we split three apps octopus commatoken malohwa commatoken and lamajun periodtoken they were all fine commatoken no complaints periodtoken  we had decent outdoor seating too periodtoken  however commatoken there was nothing too mind blowing about this place commatoken it was all very adequate periodtoken i would by no means steer people away from here commatoken but id simply state to expect a satisfactory dining experience and nothing more periodtoken","8172":"really enjoyed the ambienceoutdoors in great weather periodtoken  foodraw oysters  smoked fried oysters were excellent periodtoken the \u00e9touff\u00e9e was not remarkable which was disappointing cause this new orleans  it should be the best

for drip commatoken not starbucks burnt commatoken and the baked goods are sometimes vegan and always yummy periodtoken the staff is low key and really friendly periodtoken the interior itself is huge  several rooms  which means that youre not wanting for table space periodtoken they also have a nice outdoor seating area and a dog bowl of water for thirsty pups periodtoken   but there is one drawback cash only periodtoken it is the one factor that has me going to the starbucks three blocks away more often than not because of that periodtoken i get why a business would be cash only  im sure there are many factors  but cmon commatoken its 2011 periodtoken no one really carries cash any more periodtoken","8175":"great happy hour and nice selection of drafts periodtoken  i love that they have dairy freevegan options for free periodtoken i dont think anyone here expects authentic mexican food periodtoken the food is fine periodtoken service has been really great and friendly commatoken as opposed to the university city location which leaves much to be desired periodtoken  heres the thing periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken while i understand that mad mex has a party atmosphere in university city commatoken this is the burbs periodtoken you need to modify your business based on your demographic periodtoken loud music is fine and dandy on a friday evening commatoken but when youre trying to have a friendly drink at 5pm on a tuesday commatoken the noise level is just annoying periodtoken tone it down a little and i think you will get more business periodtoken","8177":"we had ice cream commatoken crepe and a sandwich here periodtoken the food is good but nothing memorable periodtoken   a weird thing happen commatoken a guy asked for my husbands name and wrote it down periodtoken he also manually enter the number in the system as well as looking at the back commatoken quite slowly periodtoken my husband was super sketched out periodtoken but nothing happened so far periodtoken they might just took the name for the order and the cashier is new so he was figuring his way out with cards periodtoken but be careful commatoken just in case though periodtoken","8180":"decent prices and variety of tacos commatoken  however my fish taco was very bland and seemed like the fish was boiled periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  also the donuts had a good taste but ultimately were dry periodtoken  this is good for a quick meal but not my top 5 places to grab a taco periodtoken","8181":"this is a pretty solid mexican food truck periodtoken you can pick your ingredients although sometimes they run out periodtoken i love the sweet potato option which puts a unique twist on the truck periodtoken very cheap compared to other burrito options around university city periodtoken its conveniently located on the strip of spruce food trucks and overall just a decent burrito periodtoken","8184":"this store carries many items that cant be found anywhere else commatoken but their pricing fluctuates so much i buy cases of coconut cream there commatoken and the price is never the same periodtoken last time i was charged 38 commatoken today i was charged 48 this has happened many times in the past periodtoken they do have great prices on produce commatoken but the random pricing of items can be frustrating periodtoken","8186":"i really commatoken really wanted to love dd periodtoken especially because theyre the only place in town to offer kolaches periodtoken   ive had dd about five times periodtoken ive had sliders commatoken donuts commatoken a breakfast taco commatoken kolaches commatoken and a breakfast biscuit periodtoken   the sliders were okay periodtoken nothing was wrong with them per se commatoken but i found them to be very average periodtoken with all of the rave around this establishment commatoken i was braced to have my socks knocked off commatoken but socks were not knocked periodtoken   the donuts commatoken their main selling point are far below average periodtoken yes commatoken they have some fancy concoctions periodtoken however commatoken they taste like a stale 3 day old donut from your offices break room periodtoken i feel like the novelty of the flavors are meant to make up for the mediocrity of the actual donut periodtoken   as a texan commatoken ill admit i have some high expectations for my tacos periodtoken dd tortillas were extremely bland and bathed in butter periodtoken i couldnt eat more than three or four bites periodtoken   the kolaches are okay periodtoken again commatoken as a texan commatoken i have high expectations periodtoken the kolaches are probably the best thing ive had at dd periodtoken theyre not award winning material commatoken but they get the job done periodtoken   the biscuit okay yall commatoken flat and dense periodtoken i dont even know how that happens periodtoken   overall commatoken dd is a unique experience with some unique

out from a service perspective commatoken but i felt the food was on par and very fresh periodtoken since those initial visits commatoken my experience here has not been favorable periodtoken it seems that the operations of this place has some constraints which has now impacted the food quality periodtoken they have completely dumb down their menu periodtoken the mole dish is gone periodtoken the pescado was not printed on the menu but the server said it was still available although it did not taste like the original periodtoken the tacos were lacking flavor periodtoken we tried the carne commatoken chicken and ground beef tacos and felt the meat was lacking seasoning periodtoken we did enjoy the salsa verde which accompanied the tacos and added some much needed flavor periodtoken when i asked the server what was going on commatoken she mentioned that they were transitioning menus periodtoken this seems to be the theme of this place commatoken specifically since they had a closure and reopening within the course of this year periodtoken oh and i must mention that on a prior occasion we were turned away because apparently the kitchen had crashed periodtoken i wish they would have stayed true to their original concept and worked on the service and their cocktail program commatoken which needs an overhaul periodtoken unfortunately commatoken i do not think they will last

 4 periodtoken5 food 3 periodtoken5 service 3  will return because the food and beer were good commatoken but the waitress we had was subpar periodtoken  they seemed understaffed for some reason saturday afternoon commatoken so maybe that was the reason for the poor service periodtoken   we ordered the chips and guac appetizer periodtoken pretty solid  the chips were homemade and the guac and salsa were on the money periodtoken only complaint would be the use of parsley in lieu of cilantro in the salsa periodtoken overall commatoken though commatoken we were pleased periodtoken   our lunch consisted of the carnitas and carne asada tacos periodtoken the former were far better periodtoken mango salsa should be saved for fish tacos commatoken not carne asada periodtoken not bad commatoken but not great periodtoken   for beer commatoken we had the hop hands apa the house staple commatoken im sad porter smooth and dangerous commatoken peridot jasmine ipa commatoken cellophane thin

personnel but 0 for the food commatoken  basically noting wrong but the food  commatoken i was very exciting to find this place but once i try the food tonight i wont go back to the resturant again but for the people dont know any things about taiwanese cooking it maybe ok all the traditional taiwanese dishes i order nothing is what i expected we only finished 35 of our food  it just my personal opinion ","8221":"expensive but the food is not the best the area is very clean though and the service nice periodtoken i think that if i was going to have a salad commatoken then it shouldnt cost what it does here periodtoken the hummus is all right tho","8226":"cold stone is decent ice cream commatoken but i dont think its better enough than the nearby competition to justify their prices periodtoken","8227":"id actually give this place 3 periodtoken5 stars if i could periodtoken the food is good commatoken however im not a big pastry eater so commatoken all ive had is their breakfast and lunch sandwiches and coffee periodtoken all three are good commatoken but i wish they had more options in the lunch sandwich dept periodtoken i should probably give them 4 stars for having the sand to open up in channelside periodtoken i am very grateful for that commatoken as i live there commatoken and the area is in great need of additional restaurants periodtoken all of the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere of the place is great periodtoken its my local goto breakfast joint periodtoken","8231":"pretty fast service even during a very busy day and decently clean periodtoken  unfortunately due to starbucks regulations commatoken when i asked to try one of the teas commatoken they couldnt give me a sample but hey i guess with a chain we cant be too picky periodtoken they could have been a little bit more informed on the coffee and tea choices periodtoken when my boyfriend asked one of the baristas which of their coffees has the most bold flavor commatoken she answered sorry i dont know that answer commatoken i dont drink coffee hmmm what how are you a barista with no opinion in coffee because you dont drink it periodtoken ouch that was not a good thing periodtoken

beat that periodtoken you win my vote on this day marsh periodtoken","8235":"anyone who walks into an ajs should know they arent walking out without taking a significant hit to the wallet commatoken but even with that said commatoken i think there is a bit of buyer beware to be mindful of here periodtoken  my wife and i stopped here to check out their specialty selections and found it to be a very mixed bag periodtoken  the sushi bar was an excellent find love the dragon roll but the bistro was a total disappointment periodtoken  their website said fivestar quality and while of course that was a bit of an exaggeration commatoken the selection of hot entrees we found didnt even approach twostar quality level periodtoken    on the plus side though commatoken the dessert and coffee bar was outstanding periodtoken  the selection is simply amazing periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken from chocolates commatoken to pastries commatoken to fruits commatoken coffee commatoken tea commatoken hot cocoa commatoken you name it periodtoken  we should have just stuck to sushi and dessert periodtoken  those were definitely the highlights periodtoken  as a grocery store commatoken i would only see myself shopping here to take advantage of their butcher and seafood selections periodtoken  there were some cuts and items here that you simply cant find at your typical grocery store periodtoken  but outside of that commatoken youre just paying for marked up cheerios periodtoken    so if you stick to those specialties ajs does well commatoken you will feel like you got your moneys worth periodtoken","8237":"argh periodtoken  i want so much to like the food in this cool little place commatoken but it just aint working for me periodtoken  the fruit smoothies are not to thick and taste

smile for the camera nice periodtoken  i somehow ended up ordering a supersize mixitallup platter periodtoken   it came with lots of food commatoken and even subbed in something for something else periodtoken  my problem was that the pita bread was so tough commatoken it was almost inedible periodtoken  it made it hard to scoop the other components periodtoken  left in the warmer to long periodtoken  although there was a lot of food commatoken a large part of it was greek salad periodtoken  i would have liked more hummus and tabbouleh commatoken which were good periodtoken  at 18 periodtoken99 commatoken less salad and more substance periodtoken  i am sure that they would be accommodating if asked periodtoken","8238":"i am right in the middle of the road here periodtoken the parking lot is ample periodtoken they are closed on sundays and mondays periodtoken i would think they would do a lot of business on sundays commatoken but i am not a business owner periodtoken there is outdoor seating on the front porch periodtoken walking in commatoken the hostess stand is immediately to your right commatoken the bar is to the left commatoken and the dining room is on your right periodtoken they do evidently have poker machines in an enclosed room periodtoken everything is neat and clean commatoken if a bit dark periodtoken the restrooms are neat commatoken clean and well stocked periodtoken  last night commatoken i had their special commatoken which was the seafood lasagne periodtoken layers of cheese commatoken noodles commatoken shrimp commatoken crawfish commatoken clams and yummyness that when i couldnt finish commatoken it reheated nicely for lunch today periodtoken the rest of the food is just ok periodtoken you can expect the same at any other chain restaurant commatoken which they are not a chain commatoken but it is just the same periodtoken they have no sweet tea commatoken but depending on the waitress commatoken they will add simple syrup commatoken though not all of the wait staff will periodtoken pieces of room temperature bread will be served with your meal commatoken with butter that you can add commatoken but its not warm enough to melt the butter and does not seem to be homemade periodtoken  i will continue to be an occasional patron commatoken but it isnt going to be a regular visit for me periodtoken","8239":"first impressions walking into baileys range were good periodtoken we were greeted by a single table stretching the length of the lower floor commatoken running alongside the open kitchen periodtoken i liked the thriftstore chic look of the d\u00e9cor  old windows hanging from the ceiling commatoken mason jars for water glasses commatoken milk jug lanterns for lighting periodtoken its also nice that the entire kitchen is open for the diners to see periodtoken   i was happy to see their large commatoken varied draft selection commatoken and thrilled when i realized that all but a single guest tap are beers from st periodtoken louis breweries periodtoken i was less thrilled to see the prices  5 or 7 dollars for a pint seems steep commatoken even for the high quality beers available periodtoken my party stuck to the mixed drinks commatoken which come in three varieties boozy lemonade commatoken boozy milkshakes commatoken and icepicks periodtoken my strawberry basil lemonade was good commatoken if a bit light on the basil flavor commatoken but the star of the evening was the sweet sweet bacon periodtoken perhaps the most indulgent item i have ever seen on a menu commatoken this milkshake contains bourbon commatoken salted caramel ice cream commatoken and candied bacon periodtoken it tasted as amazing as it sounds commatoken and it definitely earned the boozy title periodtoken  i ordered the buzzed burger commatoken a beef patty rubbed in espresso topped with onion commatoken bacon commatoken blue cheese commatoken and apple periodtoken i asked for it medium but it came welldone commatoken though i was the only one at my table to whom this happened periodtoken the burger itself was a bit disappointing periodtoken the bold flavors seemed to fight rather than complement each other commatoken the blue cheese being the worst offender periodtoken i tried my friends lgbt commatoken a beef patty topped with arugula commatoken goat cheese commatoken bacon and tomato commatoken and found it to be far superior periodtoken we also got an abc commatoken with apples commatoken bacon commatoken and camembert commatoken which was excellent periodtoken all of the burgers came with ketchup commatoken though i cant imagine anyone actually putting any on these elaborately topped burgers periodtoken special note goes to the dill pickles served on the side  theyre housemade and delicious periodtoken  none of the burgers came with fries commatoken so we ordered a large order that came with two side sauces periodtoken the number of sauces available is impressive commatoken i plan to return just to try some of the other ones periodtoken we got the rooster sauce pretty good and the crazy catsup excellent periodtoken the fries themselves were tasty but had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a while periodtoken this surprised me commatoken especially given the atmosphere of fresh commatoken honest cooking given by the open kitchen periodtoken  the service was some of the best ive experienced in a while periodtoken our server was attentive commatoken knowledgeable commatoken and friendly periodtoken when my friend asked her to recommend a dessert commatoken she immediately ran and fetched a sample of the salted caramel ice cream commatoken which is made in house periodtoken all of the wait staff seemed to be having a good time commatoken which was a refreshing change from the surly servers one often sees in burger joints periodtoken  overall commatoken i liked baileys range periodtoken the shakes commatoken atmosphere commatoken and d\u00e9cor were all excellent periodtoken if they fix their execution problems overcooked burger commatoken stale fries and lower the price on their beer they could easily get bumped up to 45 stars periodtoken","8242":"had the pancakes and were honestly not too impressed commatoken almost tasted a bit raw periodtoken my friend had the shrimp and grits and the sauce for that was very tasty periodtoken wouldnt return here but wasnt too bad either periodtoken","8246":"meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennothing too special periodtoken it was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8249":"i really wanted to love this place but between their odd hours and just ok coffee commatoken it doesnt hit the mark for me periodtoken if i am going to buy coffee on the go i want it to be amazing so i dont have to think about how much cheaper it would have been if i had just made it at home commatoken ha and this place just doesnt do it for me periodtoken maybe i need to try some different drinks other than just a cafe mocha or whatever it is called periodtoken it is on the way home from work so i will give it another chance and hopefully this review will change periodtoken the drive through option is really nice commatoken i will say that periodtoken","8253":"bit of a mixed bag periodtoken the coffee was good commatoken and the service was friendly commatoken but they totally forgot about my coffee commatoken and i had to remind them about it 10 minutes later periodtoken also commatoken pretty damn slow in general taking orders periodtoken   on the plus side commatoken the lady did punch my loyalty card twice as way of apology periodtoken would be far more awesome if i actually lived in nashville periodtoken","8254":"the food is always great commatoken its a place that my whole family likes and that is a bonus periodtoken the staff on the other hand are not so great periodtoken ordering in the drive thru is a joke commatoken they person on the other end can never hear you correctly periodtoken it seems as though most of the staff doesnt speak english very well and they get mad at you when they dont understand you periodtoken my order always has to be corrected at the window and it usually takes more than one person to fix it periodtoken","8256":"went back again to have the vegan french toast and this time it was totally different periodtoken i honestly think they forgot to dip it in batter and fry it periodtoken it was like warm cinnamon bread with powder sugar on top periodtoken the waitress was not very friendly at all either periodtoken the silverware was put in a mason jar on the table and was still wet from the wash periodtoken  hopefully it was just a bad sunday csuse we need more vegan restraunts in reno","8261":"i really wanted some shrimp and grits for brunch and found this hole in the wall spot periodtoken from my experience those places are usually the best periodtoken it was fairly crowded but we were seated pretty quickly commatoken however commatoken they quickly forgot about us as well periodtoken nonetheless commatoken i ordered my shrimp and grits and was very disappointed periodtoken the sauce on top of the grits was a huge letdown periodtoken the flavors were terrible mixed with the shrimp and cheese grits periodtoken it tasted as if the sauce was spoiled periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken way to lemony periodtoken it would probably pair well with grilled chicken and pasta but not on cheesy grits and shrimp periodtoken it would have been great if they eliminated the sauce periodtoken this was definitely not a win periodtoken when im back in nola commatoken ive got to try somewhere else periodtoken","8266":"after waiting days to go because of the ridiculously long line over a block long it was finally a delicious meal i was able to enjoy periodtoken however commatoken service was so cold and inhospitable periodtoken almost keeps me from returning again commatoken but the waffle i ate was just too delicious periodtoken","8269":"i was very excited to find a taiwanese place that also served milk tea in reno periodtoken being in the bay area has certainly spoiled me and my milk tea craze periodtoken there are so many different places to choose from periodtoken   they are nice people periodtoken overall their food is just okay periodtoken i do love their daily soups periodtoken they are some legit chinese soups commatoken which i simply adore and cannot get enough of periodtoken their zha jiang mien tasted like taiwanese spaghetti commatoken which they do advertise as in fine print periodtoken their popcorn chicken tastes like every other popcorn chicken out there periodtoken so it was satisfying periodtoken   they only serve black milk teas which was a little bit disappointing to me since i prefer jasmine green milk tea periodtoken   overall commatoken 3 stars just because theres no other milk tea place in reno periodtoken would i come back yea commatoken i guess periodtoken its nice that they have a checkin discount offer though periodtoken","8271":"i wish i could always give taco bell five stars periodtoken this taco bell has pros and cons periodtoken theres a really friendly guy on the drive thru speaker periodtoken youll know it if you get him periodtoken  food is great because periodtoken periodtoken taco bell periodtoken downsides are i cant sit inside in this one because there is always this beeping that makes me want to throw things periodtoken  in addition they are missing and item

i think the fries were just ok too periodtoken i honestly prob would rather get in and out periodtoken","8275":"this place is very cute and very clean with good coffee the staff is very nice commatoken but ive been here three times recently commatoken and they are consistently very slow even when i am the only one in the whole shop they also have been consistently out of things and asked me if id mind if they gave me a different drink or a different milk after i have already paid periodtoken i will continue to come back for convenience commatoken but id love to see service get a bit better","8277":"i like the ice cream here bc its really creative and pretty good but what really put me off was the smell periodtoken it might just be me but i dont know it smells kind of dingy to me periodtoken but it looks very clean so i was confused periodtoken other than that this place is cute and i like the flavor options they have periodtoken","8281":"general tsos chicken is pretty good

nothing else periodtoken in total we spent 40 on two dishes and a salad periodtoken we were just looking for some quick greek food commatoken honestly like what you would find in a food court

periodtoken","8291":"i wish their were half stars commatoken as i would rate this place a 3 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken   the first thing to note about this place is the decor outside periodtoken it looks like a mexican shack commatoken but once you walk in commatoken it is wonderfully decorated periodtoken just a note commatoken if the front parking lot is full commatoken they have a lot in back periodtoken once inside commatoken we were seated immediately periodtoken they seated us at the communal high top tables in the bar area periodtoken the first thing we noticed was how loud it was periodtoken it was hard to have a conversation without speaking quite loudly periodtoken once our server arrived commatoken we had a hard time hearing her periodtoken she was quite friendly periodtoken she dropped off chips and salsa and we ordered some guacamole periodtoken both were very tasty periodtoken i ordered the wet burrito with chicken and green sauce and my girlfriend ordered the veggie enchiladas periodtoken  the food came out very quickly commatoken less than 10 minutes periodtoken the place was fairly full on a friday night periodtoken the food was dropped off commatoken but we had no silverware or napkins periodtoken once we received our silverware commatoken we dug in periodtoken   the food was very flavorful periodtoken the burrito had a nice mix of chicken commatoken beans commatoken veggies commatoken and rice periodtoken my girlfriends veggie enchiladas looked tasty commatoken but she said they were a bit dry and lacked the sauce they needed periodtoken  overall commatoken we felt the food was decent commatoken bit not outstanding periodtoken  while we didnt have a bad experience commatoken we didnt have the best experience periodtoken  i enjoyed my meal and look forward to trying something else the next time we can visit periodtoken","8294":"i dont think i got a very fair representation of sparkles periodtoken we came around 2 oclock and there were only two flavors of cupcakes left periodtoken there was a plain chocolate and a plain vanilla periodtoken they were not the best cupcakes i have ever had periodtoken they were a little dry commatoken but still far better than gigis periodtoken i cannot stand an over abundance of frosting commatoken and sparkles cupcakes have just the right amount periodtoken  the customer service was great and definately gets 5 stars periodtoken we will have to try back another day when the cupcakes are fresh commatoken and fully stocked ","8295":"they do things right when it comes to convenience commatoken and that is the biggest reason i go to toppers periodtoken  their website is fast and userfriendly they open earlier and close later than any pizza place nearby they have frequent deals etc periodtoken  the pizza is also pretty solid and a good price id put it above donatos commatoken dominos commatoken or p periodtokenhut commatoken but below any locally owned place in terms of quality periodtoken","8299":"kinda miss the days when the baldwins ran the place periodtoken our pancakes did not have that fresh taste and flavor periodtoken  the omelet was ok periodtoken  service was still good periodtoken but when i walked out i just didnt feel like it was what it used to be periodtoken we said to ourselves waffle house might have been a better

chicken pot pie etc periodtoken i have never had a bad meal at any of the restaurants periodtoken i didnt say they were healthy commatoken they are far from healthy but they are delicious periodtoken

decorations commatoken cards commatoken books commatoken cds commatoken jewelry etc periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the decor looks like you are stepping into a hoarders farmhouse complete with a fire place periodtoken yes commatoken every single cracker barrel i have stepped into is designed with the exact same layout periodtoken you walk into what you think is the restaurant only to give your name and number in party where you are put on a waiting list well played cracker barrel then you must wander the general store until you are tempted to open the trunk of your vehicle and pack the 4 rocking chairs youve just purchased periodtoken once your name is called commatoken you follow the host to your seat commatoken past the big burning fire place commatoken the checker board tables commatoken and the other diners periodtokenyou are given a small chinese checker game to occupy yourselves until your food comes periodtoken  the place is always busy and the menu is huge one for breakfastone for lunch  dinner so my suggestion is that you peruse those while waiting for your name to be called periodtoken","8304":"these fries were amazing periodtoken crusted in parmesan and truffle oil commatoken side of aioli periodtoken the service was quick commatoken only had to wait a few minutes periodtoken the options werent as customizable as i would have liked i wanted light toppings on the fries commatoken looks like they only went easy on the aioli commatoken but there arent that many items and additives to addremove to begin with periodtoken their simplicity is their strength commatoken as every edible part of the sandwiches is packed with bold flavor periodtoken","8306":"stopped in here for lunch while completing my sandwich tour of nashville via thecitypaper and tried the italian sausage stuffed pretzel periodtoken  i was very excited for this sandwich and the uniqueness of using a pretzel as a bun periodtoken  however commatoken i was disappointed with the taste and overall presentation of the meal periodtoken  for starters commatoken the pretzel dude at the amusement park can make a better pretzel thats warm commatoken moist commatoken slight crisp commatoken and of course that delicious salt periodtoken  the pretzel here fell short as soggy and flavorless periodtoken  the cheese seemed to have been sitting on the burger as well periodtoken  still commatoken with all this the sandwich was ok yes commatoken just ok periodtoken  the waitstaff was very friendly commatoken and even gave obliged on 12 price beers when there werent any a waitress informed us there was 2 for 1s commatoken even though there werent  but the manager still helped us out periodtoken  the atmosphere was decent as well with a nice patio periodtoken  the beer selection is just ok as well  for a beer garden id expect them to have more periodtoken    given all the wonderful reviews of this place commatoken i may just have to give it a second chance periodtoken","8309":"this was actually a taco bell and pizza hut express periodtoken i got tacos commatoken but wife wanted bread sticks so it all worked out periodtoken  the 2 meal deals are radically different prices everywhere we go commatoken and this place was no exception charging 2 periodtoken79 periodtoken they did come with a large drink commatoken though i wonder if thats all they had left as everyone seemed to be getting one periodtoken i would much rather pay less and have to walk up to get refills periodtoken oh well periodtoken   my burrito was all right commatoken nothing special but not bad periodtoken my wifes pizza was about the same periodtoken the bread sticks were worth the trip though commatoken so all is well periodtoken","8312":"a decent escape but not enough to occupy for long periodtoken  we were only there for about two hours commatoken but when we left i felt like i bathed in a giant ashtray filled with cheap cigarettes and stale beer periodtoken  patrons of all walks of life commatoken all shapes and sizes periodtoken  not unlike vegas commatoken its a peoplewatchers dream periodtoken    there are several styles of new machines commatoken including a video blackjack with a live recorded dealer commatoken and a heavilycomputerized roulette and craps set up periodtoken  urban legends say casinos pump oxygen through their air vents to keep people awake longer and spending more periodtoken  hard rock doesnt even need to because there are so many people there who carry their own toting their oxygen tank in one hand and a lit smoke in the other periodtoken   there are several rooms of games commatoken and it seems like the slots go on forever periodtoken  a lot of the slot machines dont let you choose the lines you want to play commatoken you just have to play max lines all the time commatoken so beware of those commatoken if youre not the fullbore kind of gambler periodtoken  did notice the food court sporting some good food and some reasonable prices  less than 10 for a burgerfries combo commatoken so thats a plus periodtoken  didnt dine there though commatoken the smoke was so heavy all i wanted to do was leave periodtoken  showered that night commatoken woke up the next morning and i could still smell it in the hotel and in the car periodtoken","8315":"i was expecting a bit more from this restaurant

was with two friends from spain periodtoken  one ordered a salad commatoken which she said was good periodtoken the second ordered the ozark burger commatoken which looked good and was tasty commatoken she said periodtoken i ordered the turkey burger commatoken which was fairly small and on the dry side i dont eat beef so order turkey burgers whenever possible they do not have to be dry commatoken i promise  try the one at harry  izzys in indianapolis and you will taste the difference  in addition commatoken my fries were stonecold periodtoken no excuse when the restaurant is virtually empty we came in on the late side of lunch after visiting a museum periodtoken there were maybe 6 tables total that were occupied periodtoken  so no excuse for cold fries  a restaurant of this caliber should not be scraping together the left over fries to serve to a customer  our waiter was quick to replace them when i flagged him down commatoken but  by the time my hot fries came out commatoken i was already more than halfway done my meal which was disappointing periodtoken sorry we didnt try the boozy shakes periodtoken","8316":"first of all i would like to say that i adore the idea of this shop and the decor of the outsidebut when you step inside it is not really consumer friendly or spaced so you can look around you are in a tiny space trying to decide what cupcake you want while the employeeowner is right there trying to have you decideso not your typical cupcake or baker display case and the website doesnt prepare you for this periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthere are only a few flavors everyday so you  would have to preorder or call ahead to see if they have what you want periodtoken    i enjoyed the flavor of the cupcakes i had and the decorations are topnotch oh so cute so i would go there again but wish it were a little more on the inviting and comfortable side to go in and be a consumeri got the impression they just want to cater to special orders and industry people  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  yes the cupcakes are pricey but they are special and as i said previously decorated above and beyond so i think you would be hard pressed to find a cupcake that is as precious as these ones periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8319":"i still stand by my original review commatoken but for purely the professional response commatoken i will give it a 3 star periodtoken i will add that the presentation is very nice commatoken but the taste still is average in my books periodtoken could be better commatoken but is solid given their effort periodtoken","8320":"chili chicken salad was really good commatoken but ordering is a pain periodtoken we ordered directly from staff periodtoken that area is noisy and i couldnt hear the gals voice  i asked her to speak up commatoken but she didnt periodtoken   i was asked what type of bread i wanted and i said i didnt want any bread periodtoken turns out i could have had an apple periodtoken i heard this when my sister was ordering and asked her cashier if i could get a cut apple since i didnt know that i there was a choice periodtoken her cashier asked if my sister wanted to pay for it periodtoken she said no commatoken why isnt that free with her meal periodtoken she finally figured that out the apple arrived at my table commatoken uncut periodtoken  tables are usually dirty when i get there periodtoken saturday was no exception periodtoken  staff near the quick pickup window were yelling and laughing at each other periodtoken rather disruptive while we were eating periodtoken  food is really good here periodtoken the staff and cleanliness could be improved tho periodtoken","8322":"went with a buddy for 35 cent wing night commatoken definitely made the right choice the wings were delicious and only paying 3 periodtoken50 for ten of em made my day for being 6pm on a monday the place was pretty empty commatoken just the usual bar crowd hanging about periodtoken didnt bother me commatoken just thought itd be way more packed for 35 cent wings the only reason for the 3 star is that it wasnt anything really memorable periodtoken the staff was really laid back and the building was just typical periodtoken i havent tried any food other than the wings commatoken but if your lookin for some wings on the cheap get here i really want to test out wing delivery","8325":"the dishes were a bit salty for my taste periodtoken the drinks commatoken on the other hand commatoken are definitely the forte of this place periodtoken loved the ambience and laid back atmosphere periodtoken","8329":"expensive mediocre food periodtoken ham swiss spinach sandwich was okay but wouldnt bother coming here again periodtoken","8332":"lets try this one more again periodtoken came to get my complimentary meal due to a complaint over the weekend periodtoken 30 minute wait for wings after an initial 6 mins wait was what was told to me periodtoken that was to include complimentary apple pies commatoken which i never received periodtoken i appreciate the general manager taking the time to make up the horrible experience of waiting a long period for hot and fresh food periodtoken i shall enjoy my free food periodtoken","8334":"so i do like pretty sweet drinks commatoken and i like cider and usually meads commatoken however the mead here is a little sweet and syrup like for me periodtoken i think that if they had a few more options that it would be better periodtoken the wine varieties were the best in my opinion periodtoken they tasted very similar to grape juice periodtoken the strawberry pbj wasnt anyone in my groups favorite periodtoken i think this place is nice to go for a drink with a date commatoken but overall i think they need more offerings to make me stay periodtoken","8335":"i am new to the area commatoken been working on cleaning and unpacking commatoken  decided coffee and donuts were needed for breakfast and stopped here for breakfast yesterday morning periodtoken the place was packed periodtoken the hustle and bustle of morning rush commatoken but the young lady at the counter was on the ball and patient with my indecision periodtoken  even offered m a dozen card so when i get it all punched i can get a free dozen periodtoken   the donuts were a wonderfully delightful experience on my tongue periodtoken will not be long till i get that card filled i am sure   did i mention i am in the process of unpacking and moving here  good periodtoken i will tell you i was impressed enough with this place at 7 am in the morning with how fast and efficient that after a hard day of unloading a 26 ft moving truck lifting furniture into place periodtoken i decided at 9 pm to try this places other half periodtoken    the diner   we walked in periodtoken found a table as there was quite a few open periodtoken   waitress 1 walked by periodtoken  i will be with you in a moment periodtoken   5 minutes later waitress 2 said i will be with you in just a second periodtoken  did i mention that there were not that many tables filled periodtoken the counter was completely open periodtoken   several minutes passed commatoken  waitress 3 stops and says do you need menus and has your drink order been taken periodtoken  still more minutes pass periodtoken  waitress 4 brings us menus and asks what we would like to drink periodtoken  still more minutes tick past and our beverages arrive periodtoken  we place our order and the waitress disappears periodtoken   now after a long hard day of work and finally getting to sit down and relax periodtoken i drank my ice cold sweet tea half down in just a few sips periodtoken  and i started watching the show periodtoken  waitresses running here and there with no real organization periodtoken  did not appear to the observant eye that there was any real logic to their madness periodtoken   i have worked food service and customer service for over 3 decades periodtoken  i have received awards from major national corporations on customer service periodtoken  i admit i am hyper critical of customer service and its lack there of periodtoken   i know this is a family owned establishment as my husband and i never eat at chain restaurants periodtoken   we were excited to see if this would be our late night go to place periodtoken    after about 20 minutes our food arrived periodtoken our drinks were basically water from ice melting periodtoken  our food was placed in front of us and no refill was offered periodtoken  the sandwiches were good periodtoken the fries were luke warm periodtoken and our glasses were empty periodtoken    the only sign of our waitress was from across the room and she was not making eye contact periodtoken none of the first 3 waitresses approached us they were too busy with the other 4 or 5 tables periodtoken counter was still empty periodtoken    after we finished eating commatoken i was commenting to my husband about the lack of assigned stations commatoken  that management needed to divide the room up into areas so that the wait staff was not running over each other periodtoken   the waitress we had came by asked if we needed anything else periodtoken  we were done ready to leave only wanting our check periodtoken  then two of the other waitresses came by to see if we wanted to go boxes or a refill periodtoken   i wasnt vocal in my critic of the staff periodtoken or the place periodtoken i wasnt rude periodtoken  i just was having a quiet conversation periodtoken  i am not sure if it was overheard periodtoken but i was not impressed that for over an hour and 20 minutes in an establishment that had gotten such rave reviews we were basically ignored on an evening and time that was not to all appearances busy periodtoken   the total bill was 21 dollars periodtoken  i left 25 percent tip only in the hopes that the waitress will recognize us next time if we come in and work a little harder for the tip periodtoken  i usually tip 30 percent periodtoken  and 50 percent for outstanding customer service periodtoken   and as the only mom and pop type place open 24 hours a day periodtoken we will most likely be back even if it is just for the donuts periodtoken","8338":"this is the closest grocery to where we are staying periodtoken it seems to have just about everything we need commatoken but not quite periodtoken the store is clean commatoken well stocked commatoken and friendly customer service  my experience periodtoken i use this store for the staples commatoken or if i need to pick up 1 or 2 items periodtoken","8342":"it has been awhile since i last been here periodtoken they are now charging 10 to park in the parking garage periodtoken  the parking lot that used to be in front of the casino is now under construction periodtoken  its going to be awhile before i come back here periodtoken","8343":"got in line opening day to take advantage of the buy one get one free burgers with free fries periodtoken loved how they let you choose your temp for the burger and the homemade buns were light and tasty periodtoken the burger patty was delicious and juicy with a nice meaty slice of tomato and fresh lettuce periodtoken the fries were crispy and well seasoned periodtoken i was a little dissapointed with the milkshake commatoken not quite as thick and chocolatey as i would have liked and for 5 i wanted a little more periodtoken overall i was pleased with my meal but might not order a shake next time periodtoken","8345":"pretty basic food periodtoken the place itself is basic looking periodtoken i didnt find anything differentiating about this diner and its food periodtoken  if you are looking for a quick bite for breakfast its fine for that periodtoken but nothing special about it","8346":"not bad periodtoken pretty good for fast food and nice mango chicken salad periodtoken i would prefer a vinaigrette over the creamy cilantro dressing periodtoken really needs extra mango periodtoken ask for extra mango if you order this salad periodtoken check to see if there is a vinaigrette commatoken because the creamy dressing masked the other flavors in the salad periodtoken","8347":"we were really excited about trying out baileys range during a trip to st periodtoken louis commatoken based on the reviews commatoken photos commatoken and eclectic menu periodtoken  we arrived around 6 p periodtokenm periodtoken on a sunday evening to a full restaurant commatoken but were seated upstairs commatoken where you have a full view of the kitchen periodtoken the restaurant was very warm commatoken which surprised me commatoken but the patrons seemed happylots of families with children and couples in their 20s30s periodtoken  we waited quite awhile for our server to show and were eventually taken care of by an employee who wasnt our server periodtoken because wed waited so long we knew everything we wanted to order periodtoken my wife has a gluten sensitivity commatoken so thankfully they were able to provide a bun for her periodtoken their boozy milkshakes were delicious commatoken but the rest of the food was just okay periodtoken we started with the house chips commatoken which came to us cold periodtoken i asked our server if they normally came like that commatoken and he said yes periodtoken this surprised me commatoken as most locations with house chips serve them fresh from the fryer periodtoken i think they wouldve been better if they were warmbut we were so hungry that we had no problem finishing them periodtoken  the burgers are quite small for what you pay commatoken but with the beef being grass fed and local commatoken i could see why periodtoken neither my wife or i were blown away by the burger commatoken but ive never met a burger i didnt like commatoken so it did the job periodtoken the fries are quite good commatoken and come with your choice of two housemade sauces periodtoken i thought the horsey sauce was very good commatoken but didnt care for the others periodtoken  if youre in the downtown stl area and looking for a good bite commatoken id recommend this for most commatoken but if youre looking for a larger burger you might want to look elsewhere periodtoken all in all the food was good commatoken but seemed pricey for what we received periodtoken","8348":"sooooooooul food periodtoken  i went with a few friends to yummies today for lunch periodtoken  when we arrived we were the only people in the joint periodtoken  we were greeted by an overly energetic server and hostess who pointed out that all the food was on display in the case periodtoken  we were invited to sit anywhere we liked and informed that we could order from the menu or from the case periodtoken  i ordered the fried pork chop commatoken the macaroni and the greens periodtoken  i agree with previous reviews that the greens were cooked with way too much vinegar for my liking periodtoken  the pork chop was tasty as was the mac and cheese periodtoken    service was a little casual and slow on this visit periodtoken  while our food was already cooked commatoken it took roughly ten minutes for it to be served periodtoken  take away orders seemed to be served faster than dine in customers periodtoken  yummies does not accept credit or debit cards even though they have the stickers indicating they do posted on their cash register periodtoken  on this visit the establishment didnt even have cash to make change periodtoken  we scrounged to come up with enough change to pay for the soda i ordered periodtoken  if you visit yummies website prior to your visit you could receive a coupon for a free meal just by joining ning periodtokencom periodtoken  be warned that it may take a day or two to receive an email with the coupon periodtoken  httpwww periodtokenyummiesrestaurant periodtokencomaboutusspecials  all in all the food was good but the establishment was pretty quiet periodtoken","8349":"i like creole creamery commatoken but not nearly as much as it appears every one else does periodtoken any place that lets me sample as many flavors as i want before ordering scores major points in my books commatoken and i like the classic ice cream shop feel commatoken but while the ice cream is certainly good i dont think its the best ive ever had periodtoken it is the best ive found so far in new orleans commatoken though commatoken so that counts for something periodtoken sometimes parking is a little tricky in the neighborhood commatoken but a long walk to and from my car only justifies that extra scoop i inevitably always order commatoken right","8352":"a nice bar to catch up with a few friends over a quality beer periodtoken beer aside commatoken  my partner really enjoyed her pretzel and i am hearing from others that they also have enjoyed their pretzels periodtoken i ordered what the menu describes as tomato confit bruschetta periodtoken i personally was not overly fussed on this particular dish periodtoken  pros boutique beers commatoken nice atmosphere commatoken friendly staff commatoken cool people attend periodtoken the german sausages on the menu look nice but i have not tried them periodtoken they had a special deal the night i went on selected mixed spirit drinks served in pewter mugs which was a really nice twist periodtoken caring management who care about their customers periodtoken  cons  not to much to say here periodtoken the only thing i can say is that the village pub  beer garden has limited food menu options but i do understand they are a pub and not a restaurant as such periodtoken","8355":"the service is very fast commatoken some times too fast and my fries are not always cooked very well periodtoken i have to have fries that are cook all the way periodtoken but all in all the place is legit periodtoken","8357":"hate love thing on this chain periodtoken sometimes good some time irrr periodtoken  todays visit was kinda stressful periodtoken the server kinda mumbled his way through periodtoken kept having to repeat things periodtoken  they also were behind on refreshing choices periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8358":"petit piquant was oh so disappointing periodtoken i loved the cold case with all the pretty pastries and cakes periodtoken they dont have that now periodtoken maybe later periodtoken i felt like what they have was very minimal periodtoken they do have breakfast sandwiches and other sandwiches commatoken but i came for a sweet treat periodtoken  i ordered two nutella croissants periodtoken one for me commatoken and one for my hubby periodtoken the only thing that made them look fascinating was the over the top powdered sugar periodtoken  when i tried it commatoken it was lackluster commatoken kinda hard and quite lacking in nutella periodtoken was that nutella or some slight chocolate feeling periodtoken either way commatoken it wasnt worth it periodtoken   they are new in this spot as petit piquant periodtoken perhaps there will be more to come in the future periodtoken","8359":"good if you have a craving but not my favorite boba place in town periodtoken the bobas seemed smaller than what i normally see commatoken but the texture was good periodtoken not as much flavor but decent enough periodtoken service was slow but my order was accurate periodtoken seems like a fun place to hang out periodtoken","8360":"i came back again on a cold tuesday for lunch periodtoken there was two other tables eating lunch at the time periodtoken the hostess was nowhere to be seen periodtoken after waiting couple of minutes commatoken we eventually decided to sit ourselves and hope that someone would come periodtoken the waitress finally showed up periodtoken we ordered pizza and a whipped ricotta periodtoken   my boyfriend loved the pizza per usual periodtoken its amazing that it was 18 dollars commatoken which is a tad bit absurd periodtoken i love the whipped ricotta periodtoken i bring my own gluten free cracker and it ends up being a delicious fatty gluten free meal for me periodtoken  i was frustrated again my the lack of service periodtoken we both had empty water periodtoken she came by and we asked for water periodtoken we were finished 15 odd minutes later before she brought the water periodtoken the check was another service battle periodtoken she brought the check commatoken and after another 10 minutes of not returning for the card periodtoken i went into the kitchen area to find here periodtoken  it wasnt a busy day so i am confused by the lack of service periodtoken if you are buying gourmet pizzas and higher end drink periodtoken i would expect a different level of service periodtoken maybe it was just an off day but i was disappointed because this didnt match my previous experiences periodtoken","8366":"if i could rate the brewery and the restaurant separately commatoken i would periodtoken beer is excellent commatoken worthy of a 5 star review commatoken the food commatoken however commatoken is a 1 star at best periodtoken i stopped here for lunch with a friend and both of our meals were inedible periodtoken the waiter was terrible commatoken too periodtoken im glad they use all locally grown ingredients in the restaurant commatoken but they need to hire decent chefs periodtoken  the brewery is super cool and i went to the beer school which was so much fun and highly educational periodtoken","8374":"surprisingly cheap periodtoken periodtoken

periodtoken periodtokensaves costs periodtoken periodtoken   theres a cheese i like that goes for around 1012 at area grocery stores commatoken but here its 6  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and a great wash state wine that is 7 periodtoken99 at discount wine houses went for 6 here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  theyre getting my attention periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  funny last week at scolaris a customer was bagging his own groceries and joking about it commatoken and an employee joked back that they didnt have winco prices periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  no credit cards so beware","8375":"this place is pretty good but nothing too special periodtoken theres always a long wait because its a hip spot commatoken but you could go down the street for the same meal without the wait periodtoken","8379":"the food was very good periodtoken big portions periodtoken prices according to what you are eating periodtoken fast service periodtoken going again periodtoken","8382":"the food is okay commatoken great for a quick stop commatoken not not earth shattering i mean its fast food with a tropical twist periodtoken  their cilantrogarlic dipping sauce is awesome though","8383":"really good ice cream periodtoken store was very dirty unfortunately periodtoken old ice cream spilled all over counters and a little pricey periodtoken could be five stars with a little cleaning and decor could use a little updating periodtoken","8384":"the beer selection is good commatoken however they dont offer flights to sample them all periodtoken bar staff is less than friendly if you dont already know what you w","8385":"pretty bland pizza periodtoken its just missing something periodtoken maybe more sauce would help commatoken or more cheese periodtoken im not sure periodtoken the workers were really friendly but im going to keep trying other pizza places until i find my favorite periodtoken this definitely isnt it periodtoken","8386":"the place is cute commatoken but small and noisy periodtoken the coffee machines are loud if you sit in the front periodtoken im sure its more quiet in the back periodtoken i had an iced latte periodtoken the drink was pretty good periodtoken the service was mediocre thoughi felt like i was intruding the barista for asking a question about their drink menu periodtoken","8388":"ok commatoken im mildly embarrassed to be writing this review but all my cards on the table commatoken sometimes when the going gets tough commatoken i go to dairy queen periodtoken and the fact that this location periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  1 periodtoken is open till 10pm 2 periodtoken takes credit for 2 periodtoken50 3 periodtoken has smiling happy people every time ive been dont judge me  is enough to make me get on yelp commatoken pull up a chain commatoken a chain whos soft serve certainly isnt the best in town commatoken to write a review periodtoken i wish we had a bunny hutch a la lincolnwood commatoken il old stomping grounds commatoken but until then commatoken a mini pecan cluster blizzard is going to have to do periodtoken and this place does the trick","8389":"first time visiting this place and while i was not blown away by their food i gotta say that the staff was very friendly so it made up for it some periodtoken  took my son for dinner and we both ordered burgers commatoken medium rare for me and medium for him periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they tasted fine but were overcooked periodtoken  as i mentioned before this was my first visit so i will give them another try periodtoken","8394":"ive been searching for the best coffee in franklin so i gave high brow a try periodtoken  love the facility decor and location periodtoken simple brewed coffee was fine

opportunity to try kachi at the south street night market on 815 periodtoken it was on my lets try list  for the evening based on the brief description on the night market website and i happened to stumble on it at the right time periodtoken well not the right time commatoken because i waited for over an hour periodtoken but i was hungry and the menu was intriguing periodtoken   since i knew i didnt have the time to hit up another truck i decided to try two of the menu items and went for the bulgogi taco and the fried kimchi rice balls periodtoken i added the pineapple habanero sauce and gochujang to both periodtoken lets start with the taco periodtoken it came with the beef and the red cabbage slaw periodtoken even with the two sauces commatoken for whatever reason the flavors just didnt mesh to me periodtoken towards the end commatoken a piece of the bulgogi did fall out and i sampled it by itself periodtoken it was a tasty little piece of meat periodtoken i think i would have been happy with a chunk of that and some of the pineapple habanero sauce periodtoken as forewarned commatoken both sauces did have a nice little kick to them periodtoken the rice balls were just okay periodtoken i was expecting them have a little more flavor on their own but they were fairly bland periodtoken i could kind of taste the cheese but i was expecting a little more of a meltiness to the dish that just wasnt there periodtoken im not sure what kind of cheese it was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmaybe it wasnt supposed to get melty i added a little extra of the pineapple sauce and i enjoyed it a little more periodtoken the kimchi rice balls came with two balls and the the taco was one per order periodtoken for the 8 i paid commatoken i think the proportions were appropriate periodtoken   im glad i waited for it however it wasnt necessarily worth the wait periodtoken i would eat there again sans the long line however i dont love it enough to dedicate another hour or so of my life periodtoken","8402":"the food was good periodtoken but their world famous margaritas not so much periodtoken i couldve had a better margarita from a premixed bottle  the state store periodtoken that was disappointing periodtoken  service was good periodtoken","8404":"i liked the seafood gumbo commatoken but it wasnt anything crazy different or spectacular periodtoken the grand isle salad with chicken was massive in size which was great because all ingredients were nice and fresh and the dressing was wonderful bleu cheese periodtoken   this is a great lunch spot if you want some predictable but still yummy and filling food thats a good value for the cost commatoken but not a place for a foody looking for something exciting and different in new orleans periodtoken","8407":"pretty good periodtoken on the other hand commatoken i am totally unconvinced there is any kind of home cooking going on here commatoken which is implied in a really circumspect and roundabout way periodtoken when i mildly pressed the owners about recipes and ingredients commatoken i got an odd mixture of sales pitch and something about the food actually coming from india periodtoken judging from that commatoken i think a very good part of what they offer commatoken are the kinds of heat and serve or quickprep prepackaged indian dishes you can get at an indopak grocery or even trader joes periodtoken really commatoken its a great idea for what it is commatoken kind of like a hindukush flavored skyline chili commatoken but this is really and truly fast food periodtoken","8408":"insanely long wait for a sunday brunch and once we finally got seated commatoken it took forever for someone to come take our order periodtoken they seem disorganized and inefficient periodtoken i was pretty grumpy by the time we ordered    5 star dish beef wrapped pancake  4 star dish pork wrapped pancake  not as good as beef version pork ribs noodle soup  sorta like curry but not as intensely flavored  3 star dish half beeftendon noodle soup  beef good commatoken tendon delicious but noodles lacked flavor   2 star dish braised pork with rice  bland commatoken mostly rice crispy fish filet burger  bland commatoken needed some kind of sauce pork curry over rice  not the kinda curry im used to commatoken pork seemed overdone mango smoothie  way too sweet   thumbs up for authentic flavors thumbs way down for the crazy wait and disorganization periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8412":"some of the other reviewers are out to lunch this place does not pack their donairs with meat periodtoken  if anything commatoken their donairs are on the small side periodtoken  an average man with an average appetite would have to order a supersized donair to be satisfied periodtoken  that means their donairs are not big periodtoken  not only that commatoken theyre not even of average size periodtoken  other than that commatoken the proprietor is a lovely fella and the dining room is clean enough periodtoken  this is an average donair place worth checking out if youre in the area and youd like a donair periodtoken","8414":"ok commatoken for a chain it isnt bad a solid choice for a casual meal periodtoken this new location opened up near to us commatoken so the allure of unlimited french fries with your entree was too good to pass up periodtoken i mean bottomless french fries it doesnt get better for when you want to indulge a bit periodtoken for sandwiches and salads commatoken its a good option periodtoken my husband always orders the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich commatoken topped with cheddar commatoken barbeque sauce commatoken and crispy onions periodtoken  i tend to order the southwest grilled chicken salad it has chicken commatoken avocado commatoken red and green bell pepper commatoken black beans commatoken corn commatoken cheese commatoken and fried jalapeno coins periodtoken a few fried jalapeno coins make this girl very happy periodtoken i could probably eat an entire basket of those bad boys periodtoken the restaurant seems to be on a wait a lot during the weekends commatoken so be prepared to wait at peak times","8419":"this walmart was okay periodtoken  we stopped in to grab some groceries on our way home from the mountains its about 10 minutes from the pa turnpike periodtoken  from the looks of the place its huge commatoken we thought it was a super walmart but no  so no fresh meats or produce commatoken or any of the other good stuff super walmarts offer periodtoken  it also seemed a little disorganized to me so it took me awhile to find the things i was looking for periodtoken  oh well periodtoken  wed stop in for conveniences sake again commatoken but at least well know next time what they have and dont have so we can plan accordingly periodtoken","8420":"looking for a quick dinner during the week periodtoken  2 of 3 of us vegetarians i am not ordered the number 4 combo periodtoken 2 tacos beef commatoken beef enchilada and  chile con queso with beef periodtoken  pretty good periodtoken  a lot of food periodtoken the menu actually had a nonmeat section so the vegetarians did well here periodtoken service was servicable periodtoken  nothing special commatoken but not bad periodtoken","8423":"the food was delicious periodtoken we had both a chicago style and a ny style for the kids commatoken but we stole one commatoken lol periodtoken the service was also pretty good periodtoken the reason for the 3 stars is solely for the lack of credit card acceptance periodtoken i usually carry little to no cash and always pay with credit cards and we were not notified until we tried to pay that credit cards are not accepted periodtoken is this 1980 i can count on one hand how many times ive had 70 bucks on me in the last year periodtoken what would they have done if i didnt have the cash on me","8424":"most of the time the food is delicious periodtoken  but lately the food and the drinks have suffered periodtoken today i got grilled cheese sandwiches and they were terrible periodtoken how does someone mess up a grilled cheese sandwich  plus i got to cherry dr peppers and they both tasted horrible periodtoken  one was too sweet and the other one periodtoken honestly i couldnt describe the taste except that it was bad periodtoken","8426":"decided to stop in for a bite an ordered the southwestern wings an the crabby corn  quesadilla periodtoken the wings are spicy commatoken not sure why cause they should only have cilantro commatoken garlic commatoken olive oil commatoken an lime  periodtoken periodtokenaccording to the menu periodtoken the quesadilla was fine but needed some sour cream or dipping sauce on the side periodtoken its dark in here also very dark periodtoken","8428":"ive only had culvers a few timesthe best part for me is always the fries this little drivein restaurant in the tiny town i grew up in had the same kind they are crinkle cut commatoken but thin periodtoken delicious periodtoken this time i had the tenderloin commatoken which was not quite up to my hoosier standards periodtoken it tasted good commatoken but something was off for me on the texture periodtoken i like thin breading commatoken and this was a bit on the thick side periodtoken i have had the fish sandwich on my only other visit to culvers commatoken and it was good periodtoken fries are where it is at periodtoken it is a bit more expensive than standard drive thru commatoken but they make it when you order periodtoken you may have to wait a few minutes longer than a normal drive thru commatoken too periodtoken i will wait for fresh food periodtoken ","8429":"the food is decent periodtoken not great commatoken not bad periodtoken fairly priced periodtoken i also think they might be rationing napkins periodtoken the dining area and parking lot are not very fun periodtoken the drive thru line goes right through the middle of the parking lot periodtoken waited 5 minutes to back out and leave periodtoken seating is scarce and the lines to order and pick up might as well be sitting on your lap periodtoken i wont tell you not to go periodtoken you might like it periodtoken it just wasnt for me periodtoken","8430":"not recommended if you are hungry periodtoken unable to provide timely service periodtoken food could be better for the time it takes to receive your meal periodtoken also commatoken they should not serve burned hash browns periodtoken coffee was good periodtoken","8432":"serious disappointment periodtoken   this place could be awesome but there were only like 3 cookies to choose from periodtoken the brownies were great and the cookies were good periodtoken avoid the candy periodtoken","8433":"only a crazy

tasty meats periodtoken  thank gosh the salad bar is so diverse and fresh periodtoken otherwise commatoken half our group would have starved periodtoken  we always get consistent service and enjoy ourselves periodtoken just be warned commatoken this place is about meat commatoken meat commatoken and more meat periodtoken vegans stay away periodtoken","8437":"on a recent evening commatoken some girlfriends and i went to zeppoli for a night hopeful of good food and good company periodtoken they had just opened only about a month prior commatoken so we were openminded commatoken but also knew the chef was reputable and a few reviews on here said everything was good although commatoken we were skeptical if they were customer written or employee written commatoken but we were pretty confident that the food would be good periodtoken  and in the grand scheme of things commatoken the food was good periodtoken the other components though are what prompted me to write my first ever yelp review periodtoken and my girlfriends were all on board with me writing this commatoken as they too felt the same way periodtoken  first commatoken i would like to say that the service was great periodtoken  our server had literally just started working there a reddishbrownblonde haired girl named christina i believe and she fared very well  checking with the kitchen when she couldnt answer our questions commatoken raving about the desserts and rightfully so and also being very friendly and reading our table appropriately periodtoken the atmosphere was simple commatoken nice commatoken clean commatoken kind of cute periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendefinitely could use a little color perhaps periodtoken our server told us that the plates were smaller and so do not expect heaping portions periodtoken this was ok with us commatoken and how we preferred it usually periodtoken she mentioned that the chef suggests we order an appetizer commatoken pasta and an entree  that was how the menu was created periodtoken  we ordered appetizers commatoken each an entree and each a dessert periodtoken the portions were indeed very small periodtoken but some of what we ordered definitely did not equate to any value whatsoever periodtoken a seafood dish  with a few pieces of seafood and some cous cous was 26 periodtoken the special with lamb and gnocchi was similarly priced and also was a small portion periodtoken  all of the desserts although very good commatoken except the flourless chocolate torte was very unexciting were 8 each periodtoken that is expensive periodtoken we felt as though some of the prices were citylike prices commatoken but we were in collingswood periodtoken our bill commatoken including gratuity commatoken came to just over 250 periodtoken thats 50 a person periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenfor a byob  insane we were all still hungry after dinner and hence why we all ordered dessert  which we never ever do periodtoken overall commatoken we each ordered one entree commatoken one dessert and we all split two appetizers periodtoken the one appetizer was the antipasti commatoken which we tripled per the servers suggestion because its 9 per person and it was a very small portion commatoken with very little cheese or meat periodtoken in the end commatoken we paid 27 for an appetizer of mostly marinated vegetables and such periodtoken that is just ridiculous and absurd all in all commatoken we enjoyed ourselves because of the company of each other and we did enjoy some of the food commatoken but for the price commatoken i know i will never go back and having spoken to the others commatoken i know they feel the same way periodtoken its unfortunate commatoken because the place has potential periodtoken","8440":"the yogurt has great flavor but you really need to be careful or youll end up spending a fortune periodtoken the yogurt and toppings are sold by the ounce periodtoken since the cups are so large commatoken you dont realize how much youre getting until you put it on the scale to pay periodtoken  i love their yogurt but id rather the old fashion method of small medium large for pricing periodtoken the shock at the register isnt worth it periodtoken if you go often commatoken you can start to sense how much your bowl will cost periodtoken ive gotten consistent at keeping it under 3 but i dont get much periodtoken","8442":"ok we made a stop here for a nice dinner on our travels home from spring break first of all periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken all of the food was wonderful atmosphere was pretty neat as well  our server was very attentive and friendly but not overbearing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenas a server myself periodtoken periodtokenthat is important knowing just the right level of interaction desired by a server periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthumbs upthe reason i have rated a 3 out of 5 is because unlike the server  commatokenfood  commatokenand atmosphere there was a man periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwho seemed to be in the role of a server assistantkey hourly periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhe was extremely rude with his looks and demeanor periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni wish i knew his name because i would make that known but i didnt see a name tag periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so i def recommend for amazing food and as long as no interaction with this man im positive your experience will be awesome","8444":"clean commatoken lots of toppings commatokenno line commatoken the overall flavor of the yogurt mediocre periodtoken as an overweight person the worker  made me feel a little bit uncomfortable when he weighed by ice cream 3 times because it was over 9 for just mine periodtoken","8445":"their breakfast is wicked cheap commatoken cheaper than those swanky hotels lining the street commatoken and theyre open until 4am fridays and saturdays periodtoken  and they have jalapeno poppers winner combination periodtoken","8447":"awesome idea  execution is a bit haphazard periodtoken sometimes it can be absolutely amazing periodtoken sometimes not periodtoken and it can be a bit loud periodtoken   all that

computer sometimes you just have a different scenery i noticed that this starbucks is a neighborhood starbucks pretty much the people that came in  know the employees periodtoken me personally im not a huge starbucks fan i dont drink a lot of coffee but the atmosphere is so calming and soothing and the smell of the coffee in the teas and pastries are somewhat relaxing periodtoken so what the fall season they have all these new and  different coffee mixes for the fall season that customers  are flocking in to get periodtoken   i decided to try the iced caramel macchiato with pumpkin sauce instead of vanilla let me tell you it was an acquired taste very different yet delicious periodtoken  you can earn starbucks rewards and have a starbucks account and you can purchase really cool

enjoyed the sandwich periodtoken it was big the bread is fresh periodtoken taste of havana offers the option of ordering a side and soft drink for an additional 2 periodtoken50 periodtoken you dont need a side dish though periodtoken the sandwich is enough to fill you up periodtoken   the staff was very friendly and nice to me as i placed my order periodtoken it takes longer than you would think for them to make a sandwich periodtoken as i was eating commatoken they walked out from behind the counter to near my table and started talking in spanish and laughing periodtoken it was probably perfectly innocent commatoken but it seemed like they were making fun of me as i ate my meal periodtoken it felt awkward periodtoken   my sandwich was good commatoken but it was too expensive

the food could do more justice periodtoken","8464":"good for drunken college nights not sure what its doing in carmel indiana besides inviting us to relive those unfortunate choices periodtoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken if youre going to commatoken make sure to get the taco sticks periodtoken this location holds true to the disappointment of any standard type of pizza periodtoken if pizza is a must though commatoken go with the loaded totza periodtoken","8466":"for what it is commatoken this cafe isnt bad periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut based on my one visit commatoken it just wasnt anything particularly special or memorable either  its situated in the small downtown area of clearwater periodtoken theres not much going on down there commatoken but unfortunately i still had to pay for parking at a nearby garage theres some free parking nearby on nights and weekends periodtoken the cafe is pretty cool inside  has interesting decor that seems both elegant and modern commatoken but also distinctly steampunk style periodtoken one major drawback for me is that it was warm as heck in there not sure if there were just ac problems that day or if thats the normal temp commatoken but i cut my trip significantly short due to this periodtoken also commatoken a lot of tables and chairs had crumbs or napkinswrappers on them commatoken so that was a little offputting as well periodtoken  the staff that helped me were ok commatoken kind of stiff but i guess decent enough periodtoken i ordered an iced espressobased drink called smores freddo espresso over ice with chocolate sauce commatoken a ton of marshmallow whipped cream commatoken graham cracker crumbs and a piece of tiramisu periodtoken again commatoken nothing special  both were just ok to me periodtoken the drink was not nearly as sweet as i hoped it would be commatoken bit the espresso was smooth and robust periodtoken the tiramisu was a little stale commatoken like perhaps it had been out in the case too long commatoken but the flavors were alright periodtoken  all in all commatoken i dont have anything super critical to say of this place  i just wasnt impressed in any regard periodtoken in my opinion commatoken there are just too many other coffeeshopcafe options i could choose from commatoken that would probably also be a little cheaper commatoken for me to want to try here again periodtoken","8468":"overall a sub par experience commatoken bordering and teetering on a 2 star rating periodtoken decided to try yoko with all the great reviews about it periodtoken easy to find in a shopping plaza off the herded path periodtoken   entered the restaurant and beatles music was playing in the background periodtoken it seemed only about 5 songs were playing till it was

periodtoken   ordered the miso soup which was very tasty periodtoken had sushi which was flavorful but commatoken ok periodtoken i was expecting from some of the reviewers commatoken fresh fish

periodtoken   this place was very cold commatoken but the end of the night commatoken most customers had jackets on and were freezing periodtoken i had complained commatoken but was ignored periodtoken very expensive as well for subpar food periodtoken the place was dead for a saturday night commatoken maybe word is getting around periodtoken  most likely would not return periodtoken","8469":"hotel mazarin periodtoken  we chose this hotel because it was rated 2 hotel in the french quarter periodtoken  i was going to give it only 2 stars because it was so loud in our room commatoken but there are many good qualities to this charming hotel periodtoken   ive never been to nola so i wanted to be within walking distance to everything commatoken and hotel mazarin is located in the heart of the fq periodtoken however commatoken it is really really close to bourbon street and therefore was loud until 4am every night we stayed periodtoken a cacophony of music commatoken screaming drunk people commatoken revving motorcycles commatoken honking horns made times square seem like alaska in the dead of winter in comparison periodtoken   now commatoken we chose to visit nola just a couple of months ago so there were only three rooms available periodtoken we got the king deluxe with a balcony over bienville streetand i see why this room wasnt picked earlier by anyone periodtoken  the room is nice with marble floors commatoken comfortable bed commatoken and good view outside periodtoken  but i would never ever stay here again because im sleep deprived periodtoken  i wonder if the rooms away from the street are quieter periodtoken  if so commatoken i would reconsider staying here again and give this place a 45 star rating periodtoken  the front desk people are nice and polite periodtoken  the bellmen are helpful periodtoken the concierge is wonderful and got us into restaurants when we couldnt get a reservation  thank you janet periodtoken  she also booked us on two tours commatoken that picked us up right here periodtoken rooms were clean periodtoken  wifi is free though too slow for streaming shows or skype most of the time periodtoken the hotel is beautiful with a central courtyard periodtoken  complimentary breakfast was pretty good periodtoken  maybe i am too middle aged and this hotel is only for young party goers periodtoken  i see now it would have been better to stay block and blocks away from bourbon street periodtoken","8470":"ive been back here 3 times since my horrible experience below periodtoken luckily commatoken i didnt see the waiter in question periodtoken i hope he no longer works there i was brought in the door by the elite event a few months ago periodtoken it is a great space for a party and i really liked the fudge and the boozy ice cream drinks periodtoken  i came back here once for just ice cream with allison b and stephanie s during the midtown alley streetfest periodtoken i got a scoop of after dinner mint and a scoop of coconut almond joy periodtoken they were delicious i especially like the coconut almond joy periodtoken its a very unique flavor that i havent seen elsewhere periodtoken  the other time commatoken i tried the food periodtoken we got the symphony platter to start periodtoken it was basically cheese garlic bread with pesto periodtoken i liked it a lot it was dropping with oil though commatoken which was a little bit of a turn off periodtoken then i got the royal grill with stutz salad periodtoken it took a long time for our food to come out periodtoken i was glad we got an appetizer my sandwich was just ok periodtoken there werent many apples on it commatoken and despite having special sauce on it commatoken it was a bit dry periodtoken the salad was not good periodtoken it looked appetizing commatoken but the dressing was bland and flavorless periodtoken i couldnt eat it periodtoken   i topped the meal off with a scoop of the coconut almond joy periodtoken yum  all in all commatoken id come back now commatoken for dessert and appetizers periodtoken im not sure if ill have a meal here but i might give it one more go periodtoken","8472":"if you are looking for fast fast food periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenugh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthis is not it  it took 10 minutes to even order our food periodtoken  speed

5 minutes to get it i am not sure they are doing things the most effective way or what periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut if you are in a hurry commatoken  go elsewhere periodtoken  the food tastes just like any other panda commatoken so you get what you expect","8473":"it is rare that i give bad reviews but this review in particular is for the super greasy and under cook boneless chicken periodtoken like how do you serve under cook boneless wings smh periodtoken this wings stop is the closest to my house so hopefully next time the service and food is better periodtoken note to self  stick with bone in please","8474":"perhaps i need to give prep and pastry a second shot commatoken because my first visit was not as amazing as the reviews would suggest periodtoken  i must give them a lot of credit for their unique menu commatoken impressive bakery and extensive array of brunch cocktails periodtoken  i also loved the rustic venue commatoken with its high ceilings and wood floors periodtoken  our waiter was a delight commatoken he really made our experience a pleasant one periodtoken    my only criticism is the food periodtoken  i was told that i have to order the french toast because its their specialty periodtoken  i ending up getting the french toast of the day commatoken which had whipped cream commatoken blueberries commatoken sweet cream cheese and brioche bread periodtoken  to begin with commatoken the portion was way too big periodtoken  they gave me four huge slices and im the type of person who prefers less food commatoken so that i can enjoy my meal without feeling engorged periodtoken  the texture of the french toast was too dry commatoken it seems like they didnt soak it in the custard long enough periodtoken  there were very few blueberries and the combo of whipped cream and cream cheese was just too rich periodtoken  maybe i ordered the wrong item  my mom had the a periodtokenm periodtoken relleno which was the perfect portion size and very tasty commatoken but a little too spicy periodtoken  my brother ordered the monte cristo with a side of biscuits and gravy periodtoken  again commatoken the portion was out of control  two giant sandwiches that were impossible to eat commatoken with a ton of potatoes periodtoken  altogether commatoken just too heavy periodtoken  as for the drinks commatoken my coffee and peachorange mimosa was delicious commatoken but the red sangria was far too sweet periodtoken  to top it off commatoken this place is crazy busy on the weekend periodtoken  my family and i got there at 9am commatoken so we only had to wait about 20 minutes periodtoken  after 10am commatoken it was a zoo periodtoken  im probably in the minority here commatoken but i think prep and pastry is trying too hard to impress their customers with lots of flavors and huge portions periodtoken  they should scale back and simplify periodtoken  i know its brunch and its supposed to be decadent commatoken but you have to strike a balance periodtoken  i think ill stick with bline for breakfast periodtoken","8475":"went here last night for the first time periodtoken  parking is horrible but so is everything on south grand periodtoken  the place is smaller than i expected but it was quaint periodtoken  they had a really good selection of martinis as thats what they are known for but the service wasnt very good periodtoken  even though we were at a table with a server we still had to go back up the bar to get drinks and cash out periodtoken  i may consider going back another time commatoken strictly for the martinis periodtoken  i will probably sit at the bar next time periodtoken","8477":"i have to say i have never dined here but one night i was lucky enough to find a parking spot to go inside and order some donuts periodtoken i was surprised at how expansive the space was periodtoken one half of the space is just for donuts and the other half for sit down diner food periodtoken  its true what harden says you can find cops eating there all the time at night periodtoken im not sure if their service is as good as the first reviewer mentioned but they make a pretty tasty mushroom swiss burger periodtoken  their donuts are really good soo good that my sister ordered a mini donut tray for a party and they were a big hit they also have one of the better kingcakes in town if you dont want to drive to gretna for your kingcake fix periodtoken","8480":"first time here commatoken the wife wanted pizza and somehow the place showed up on the list of best pizza in indy periodtoken huge fan of 3wiseman commatoken but we want try something else for a change periodtoken the porter was good commatoken scotch eggs were pretty good as well periodtoken didnt enjoy the beer cheese crock with bread commatoken found it a bit salty and way more beer than cheese periodtoken as for the pizza commatoken we went with a large pub pizza which was good but 3wisemen dr herrs is still much better periodtoken best part of the meal would be the bread pudding commatoken just good sweet bread pudding with some layers of chocolate and a good strong bourbon glaze periodtoken overall the dining experience was ok commatoken maybe wed come back some other time and try the other dishes periodtoken","8482":"the organ box that you get is nice and well cutpacked commatoken but the service is not the best periodtoken first they deliver only one day a week and since exactly on that day i have all my important meetings it was pretty difficult to arrange a delivery periodtoken they almost wanted to leave the frozen pieces in a box behind a door on a relatively busy street periodtoken in my organ box there were no pieces of tail at first place commatoken but what i finally got after sending couple of emails periodtoken","8484":"layout is a bit questionable and their ancillary selection commatoken which should be the redeeming factor here commatoken is a bit lighter than expected periodtoken still commatoken fuel points are great and sticking to the kroger network helps those little tidies all add up commatoken so despite wandering around for far longer than i should have been in search of something that the store ultimately and moderately unbelievably did not have commatoken this one gets a pass periodtoken wine and beer selection here also seemed a bit on the slight side periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenalbertsons is still the best bet in this market commatoken for obvious reasons and were it not for those points periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenone other thing of note periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe gas pumps for this location are nowhere near the actual store periodtoken","8488":"a couple of colleagues and coworkers rave about this place so we checked it out one time periodtoken   similar to a quick chipotlestyle commatoken choose your toppings lineup commatoken its fast and fairly quick periodtoken i ordered a veggie burrito combo lunch meal commatoken which came with a hefty size burrito commatoken chips and salsa commatoken and a large drink periodtoken it was good commatoken but nothing to rave about periodtoken   the service was quick and nice commatoken but i cant say i had the same feelings towards this place as i had previously heard from others periodtoken","8489":"interesting pairing of tacos and donuts periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  they tried for the trend factor and it was just ok periodtoken there is only one counter to order periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so pray there is not a large family in front of you periodtoken it looks family friendly but then there is a bar periodtoken a coffee bar would probably make more sense periodtoken it was slow for a friday eve periodtoken food was just ok periodtoken too much jalape\u00f1o in the cheese sauce periodtoken they cant easily customize your order periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenexample  i just wanted plain shredded cheese instead of spice  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken no can do periodtoken  donuts were good periodtoken waiters were very friendly i will give it another shot but not as wowed as other reviewers periodtoken","8490":"good intentions commatoken but poor execution in some areas periodtoken friendly staff commatoken relaxed and quirky atmosphere especially the music commatoken if not the best decor periodtoken our waiter was very attentive and nice commatoken but a bit forgetful so some of the dishes we requested did not make it to the table periodtoken  the chicken and waffles were quite tasty commatoken but sliders they were not periodtoken but cut that waffle piece in half commatoken use it to sandwich the chicken and its close enough periodtoken we were not offered much syrup with them commatoken and ended up requesting more on the side commatoken so i dont think we really got to perceive the sriracha component that was supposed to be present periodtoken   cowboy burger was freshly made and the meat juicy commatoken but the bottled overly sweet bbq sauce ruined it a bit periodtoken the turkey burger was similarly fresh but suffered from a conflict in flavors roasted garlic hummus is tasty commatoken  but it and possibly the spices in the patty itself competed with a cranberry chutney i was hoping to taste periodtoken fries needed salt commatoken the sauteed spinach was far too oily to eat periodtoken those who ordered enchiladas were happy enough periodtoken the places eponymous grilled cheese lacked cheese periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so that was a bit of a letdown periodtoken  we did not try the ice cream or the desserts that generally garner positive reviews but at that point we didnt want to be disappointed any further periodtoken this is an okay place with the potential to be quite nice commatoken but it could use a little bit of editing in the menu and its execution periodtoken stop by for the chicken and waffles commatoken if nothing else periodtoken","8491":"1 periodtoken disgusting truffle oil fries periodtoken the only reason why people use crap like truffle oil is to make the food seem fancy periodtoken fries are something that do not need truffle oil flavoring commatoken especially not fake truffle flavoring that nearly all restaurants use periodtoken   fyi folks commatoken almost all truffle oil is not made from truffles commatoken its made from synthetic chemicals periodtoken  2 periodtoken they do have delicious sliders and delicious seafood sliders periodtoken","8492":"i hate change periodtoken  i could walk around the old shoprite blindfolded and know exactly where to put my hand on which shelf to grab what i need and still get outta there quicker than this fiasco they call the new shoprite periodtoken    its not terrible commatoken but its got some kinks it needs to work out commatoken and by work out i mean the whole layout needs to be demolished and then redesigned to accommodate the large crowds periodtoken    i dont think they took into account that double the amount of people will be crammed into this space commatoken regardless of square footage periodtoken  not only do you have the old snyder shoprite folks now begrudgingly making their way over to the new location commatoken you still have the former oregon pathmark people who are like commatoken hey commatoken this is our turf periodtoken  its literally the only onestop shop commatoken unless you wanna go to walmart or target for terrible meatproduce selections and lets face it commatoken no one wants to go there unless absolutely necessary periodtoken  shoprites selections and deals are the shiiitttt periodtoken  so anyway commatoken the pros larger space for dat entrance doe with all the fun commatoken extra shit we never had or probably needed before commatoken like a hot chinese food buffet sushi area amazing cheese variety way more fresh donuts commatoken pastries commatoken cakes commatoken breads commatoken etc periodtoken and a sweet bonus commatoken tuckedawayinacorner pricy organic section where you can get 8 brown sugar tons more of the 15 items or less registers with kitschy signs named after philly streets periodtoken   pro tip you can also check out at customer service during high volume  which it always is periodtoken toiletriesbathroom stuff section is in the dead center of the aisles commatoken lower shelves and very well lit  seems much better than the last place and has a great selection periodtoken parking lot is larger commatoken i think periodtoken  i havent encountered many problems with this periodtoken the inner aisles seem spacier and more breathable and everything seems to have a better selectionvariety in general periodtoken  as for the outskirts of the store commatoken stay tuned below periodtoken they finally adopted the giant family boxes of cereal like target  buy in bulk commatoken people  the cons carts allllll the way on the left when the entrance is allllll the way on the right periodtoken  produce area is just periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenweird periodtoken  like i gotta dig inside deep  shelving to get to the good onions instead of them being out in the open i guess so peoples grubby fingers dont touch everything at once periodtoken every goddamn thing i need besides the meat commatoken luckily is in coolers with doors in the wall now commatoken as opposed to the old grab and go commatoken looseygoosey feel periodtoken  so if 10 people need milkojeggsjuiceyogurt in the same area youre in commatoken you best be sure youve gotta politely wait for 10 people to browse commatoken select and leave periodtoken  legit commatoken the giant area from where the coolers start to where they end is just a sea of people and carts youve gotta meander through periodtoken  honestly commatoken forego the cart and do small basket grocery runs to save yourself the hassle commatoken if you can periodtoken the dreaded crowds the fishmeatcoolers sections are terrible commatoken but even worse is the checkout lines periodtoken  somehow commatoken the old place managed to get a handle on this periodtoken  i think this space is narrower here periodtoken  try to get to the speedy checkout if you only have a little bit commatoken but otherwise commatoken have fun finding where one line ends and the other begins with all the damn carts periodtoken  overall commatoken come here on offpeak hours periodtoken  avoid the weekends periodtoken  a tuesday night is better than a saturday morning periodtoken","8494":"right off exit 7 on the njtp south periodtoken  has a drive through and a big parking lot commatoken right next to a convenience store periodtoken","8499":"it is a nashville staple that must be tried commatoken but only if you have the time commatoken as the line to get in tends to wrap around the building and typically results in a wait of about an hour or so periodtoken  because of its reputation commatoken its a magnet for tourists commatoken especially on the weekends periodtoken  my favorite time to go is in the early afternoon during the week commatoken after the lunch rush but before they close at 3 periodtoken  its really the best way to enjoy pancake pantry periodtoken  the food is sturdy commatoken traditional commatoken delicious breakfast fare that is served up fresh and plentiful periodtoken  dont come here if youre not eating carbs or are looking for fancy breakfast cuisine periodtoken  pretty much anything they offer is good commatoken so much so that im hard pressed to pick a favorite menu item periodtoken  they serve real maple syrup which is a rare thing to find commatoken especially down south periodtoken  the servers are friendly but brisk as they are well aware of the line outside periodtoken  the table service and turnover is actually pretty efficient commatoken so even though youre waiting in line for an hour commatoken expect to get your food within 10 or so minutes of ordering periodtoken    the reason for the long wait is the small size of the restaurant periodtoken  theyve masterfully put as many tables as they can in their dining room commatoken but its nowhere near the capacity needed to fill the demand periodtoken  heres a hint and a tip for coming her in a large group periodtoken  dont periodtoken  its not a very good place to go eat if youve got more than three or so people with you commatoken unless you plan to split up and sit at different tables periodtoken  and its aggravating for those waiting in line who have to wait longer because they now have to take three of their already limited tables to fit your whole group periodtoken  one little unknown thing about pancake pantry is that you can order food to go commatoken which is a great way to get a delicious breakfast and not have to wait around for it periodtoken  if youre in a hurry commatoken or just impatient commatoken call your order in ahead of time commatoken grab it and go periodtoken  also they serve sandwiches commatoken salads and soups for those of you nonbreakfast eaters commatoken though i dont know anyone who goes there strictly to eat lunch periodtoken","8504":"needed a few things commatoken was in the area so stopped in this store periodtoken  safeway never seems to have any real competitive prices on things i buy commatoken in other words not cheap periodtoken  we wanted to purchase something from the bakery department of which there was need for an employees assistance periodtoken  trying to get someones attention in the department was unsuccessful periodtoken so i found another employee and asked him to assist periodtoken he did get another from the deli and we got what we wanted and went on our way periodtoken  we were told no one was working in the bakery periodtoken  it took a few minutes for the person to be found and brought over to help and this gave us time to actually look over the department periodtoken man this place needs a good scrub commatoken what we saw could not have been the result of one days neglect periodtoken we almost left before we were actually helped commatoken but braved it and hope we did not kill anyone that received what we bought periodtoken  perhaps someone should be working the department if for no other reason to clean it up periodtoken","8510":"friendly bartender commatoken the beer was middle of the road quality periodtoken  folks seemed to enjoy the molecular munchies food truck periodtoken  the ambiance fits the tech park environment periodtoken","8512":"breakfast in my hometown periodtoken  i like sharing dining experiences with my family whenever i come home periodtoken  the food at

patience is low periodtoken","8521":"its a cute corner coffee shop periodtoken ive never been too impressed with their drinks tbh commatoken i wouldnt recommend going there for that at all periodtoken but their pastries are legit especially the banana bread and cookies periodtoken id suggest they get vegan cookies for the lactose intolerant folks commatoken but otherwise the place is pretty cool periodtoken its more of a oh crap whats close by than a lets drive here kind of place periodtoken mornings its full of construction workers no harm to them commatoken i get it commatoken but theres no where to really sit or stand thats not in the way of someone else periodtoken one up point the people who work behind the counter are all genuine and friendly commatoken ive never had a bad experience due to them periodtoken but im most excited to see how theyll grow and hopefully how their reputation will improve periodtoken","8528":"i really wanted to give a 5 star review and on some of the dishes i can but others were average and others a bit below periodtoken  the sausage and broccoli rabe was very good commatoken clearly housemade periodtoken  the sardines were huge and nicely grilled periodtoken  the lemon pasta commatoken the reason i was so excited to go commatoken was awful  the delicate homemade noodles were completely lost in what appeared to be straight lemon juice  the seafood stew with a moroccan vibe was delicious and the bass was ok periodtoken  the almond pannacotta was light and lovely but the zeppoli were large and really just sweet periodtoken    its a lovely little place commatoken very friendly and helpful staff but tiny and with really hard commatoken uncomfortable chairs maybe a way to move diners along to make room for the next batch periodtoken  when our check came we were told that the credit card machine was down and they could only accept cash periodtoken  would have been nice to know before we ordered almost 200 worth of food periodtoken","8529":"i was expecting more from baileys range commatoken but i think theyre still working out the kinks periodtoken at least i hope so periodtoken there was a crowd saturday night commatoken but no wait when we got there around 730 periodtoken we were seated at the last 2person table upstairs commatoken directly overlooking the kitchen periodtoken so lets just say i got to watch a whole lot of chaos commatoken including an order being returned commatoken orders sitting way too long on the counter commatoken and just general pandemonium periodtoken  i dont get the long communal table downstairs periodtoken all the different parties were seated with empty chairs between them commatoken so isnt that just a huge waste of space and if you do sit strangers right next to each other commatoken who wants that i definitely do not periodtoken  service seemed to be hit or miss periodtoken our waitress took forever to take our order and bring out the check commatoken but our food came out pretty quickly periodtoken conversely commatoken the table right behind us came in 10 minutes after us commatoken but they had their desserts and check way before us periodtoken  i really liked the smoked onions rings at first commatoken but then the more i ate the less i liked periodtoken they have a thick commatoken soft batter on them and the onions are thickly cut periodtoken we didnt get appetizer plates when they were brought out commatoken yet the dipping sauce is served in a small jar that you cant fit an onion ring into unless you cut it up periodtoken im all for the cute little touches in this place like the jars commatoken but in this case its not functional periodtoken  i also wasnt a fan of the two types of catsup i tried periodtoken the normal that comes with the burgers is really sweet periodtoken and i got the crazy catsup with my fries and liked that even less periodtoken kudos for making their own sauces commatoken but in this case i prefer heinz periodtoken  however commatoken the fries were really good periodtoken salty and hot periodtoken i ordered the patty melt commatoken which came on crustless rye instead of the homemade bun periodtoken by the time the food was delivered commatoken the bread was soaked through with grease so i had to eat it with a fork periodtoken it tasted pretty good commatoken but i couldnt differentiate between the mo grassfed beef and beef at any other restaurant periodtoken it was a little crumbly commatoken too periodtoken i ordered no pink commatoken though the onions were too thickly sliced for my liking commatoken but the rooster sauce tasted good periodtoken the burgers come with lettuce commatoken tomato commatoken onions commatoken and pickle slices on the side periodtoken the 2 tiny pickle chips i got were so good commatoken but they covered about half my burger periodtoken the same is true of the tiny tomato slices periodtoken extra pickles cost extra periodtoken bad periodtoken  they have the largest soda selection of any place ive ever been periodtoken pretty much anything you could possibly want they have periodtoken i went with the cola on draft periodtoken good stuff periodtoken  since we were at the very last table commatoken we were closest to the upstairs soda fountain and dirty dishes table where the servers stack all the dirty dishes periodtoken it seemed like the wait staff was a little frazzled and i definitely overheard some complaints coming from them periodtoken the dirty dishes were stacked so high i thought they were going to fall over periodtoken apparently no one was coming up to take them to the kitchen periodtoken yet i saw one employee filling water bottles the entire time and another wiping glasses the

periodtoken with groceries periodtokenand sometimes wifi periodtoken  way back when i was stocking my cabinets with food instead of books commatoken dierbergs and trader joes was a weekly run periodtoken i bought the hell out of couscous commatoken cheese commatoken sparkling grape juice and fruit leather periodtoken the cheese packaged instore was phenomenal commatoken plus i loved having an entire aisle dedicated to organicnaturalspecial diet items periodtoken being able to pick up vitamins commatoken sweet potato chips commatoken dark chocolate commatoken frozen indian meals and toothpaste within 10 feet was perfect periodtoken the selection for these items was greater than at schnucks commatoken and the store always was cleaner periodtoken youd pay 0 periodtoken501 more for things commatoken but that was an acceptable tradeoff periodtoken also commatoken huzzah for the store being at a metrolink stop  dierbergs still has all of that commatoken but i use the store completely differently now periodtoken these days commatoken i go for lunch commatoken snacks and wifi periodtoken i grab fresh fruit from the produce section commatoken make a salad from the bar commatoken pick up a 0 periodtoken50 bottle of water and head to the cafe area to eat while writing periodtoken the store still works commatoken but over the past few months commatoken ive had some setbacks periodtoken  salad bar  not the best selectionvariety of toppings periodtoken   bar always is messy periodtoken  labels are used only about half the time periodtoken  not as vegetarian friendly as it first appears periodtoken kidney beans are usually the only kind of vegetarian protein available commatoken and those arent put out all the time periodtoken meaty toppingspasta salads often are in back commatoken so customers spill them into the vegetarian ones toward the front during the reach periodtoken labels dont have vegetarian notation commatoken and its hard to see whats in some of the pastas periodtoken hot soups arent vegetarian commatoken despite being broccoli or vegetable usually made with meatbased stockbroth  i asked periodtoken  wifi cafe  convenient nook at the front of the store periodtoken bright and pleasant commatoken thanks to large windows periodtoken  out of about 14 tablesbooths commatoken only one of them has an outlet commatoken and its not

commatoken its often very slow periodtoken it also bans you from most streaming media no commatoken im not trying to watch netflix commatoken but for my job i often need to listen to individual songs or watch videos embedded within blog posts periodtoken despite this commatoken spotify works for some reason commatoken though not well periodtoken  there are no utensils near the cafe area commatoken so if you drop your fork commatoken you have to go all the way back to the salad bar to get it  not awesome when youve already got your laptop and such strewn about periodtoken why not stock some utensils at the cafe area with the coffee cups and napkins  generally commatoken i like dierbergs periodtoken if i actually kept food at my place commatoken id likely buy some of it here periodtoken and having a store and wifi cafe in the inner ring is nice for a quick stop between clients periodtoken but even though dierbergs is a little better than regular schnucks stores commatoken it could learn a lot about salad bar arrangement and maintenance and wifi cafes from schnucks culinaria model downtown periodtoken","8532":"i arrived to work today feeling a little under the weather commatoken aka i drank my weight in wine last night and felt like death warmed over periodtoken i decided to drink oj for breakfast and load up on calories for lunch periodtoken pizza thats a no brainer periodtoken  i walked to the comcast center with a friend and chose a slice of la scalas pizza of the day which was pepperoni and sausage commatoken and also asked for a plain slice periodtoken to top it off i ordered a root beer soda periodtoken my total was close to 9 periodtoken i havent had any of their entrees but they all looked delicious commatoken sitting pretty behind the display glass periodtoken my name was called a few minutes after i ordered and i loaded up my pizza slices with crushed red pepper and garlic from the tray located a few feet in front of the setup periodtoken  the pizza was a little too greasy commatoken but nothing a few napkins couldnt take care of periodtoken each bite was delicious and the crust was fantastic periodtoken if i win the lottery or am lucky enough to get an annual raise this year commatoken ill be sure to make la scalas a favorite eatery periodtoken until then commatoken i might have to stick with 5 foot long sandwiches periodtoken","8533":"this place has pretty good food for a decent price and its close to my house periodtoken sold periodtoken   as some other yelpers have said commatoken the atmosphere is a little  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenoff commatoken so i prefer to get it to go periodtoken its very casual commatoken to say the least periodtoken its very open and usually quietempty commatoken so you almost feel like youre intruding on the employees when dining in periodtoken each time ive dined in weve been the only occupied table periodtoken its a little awkward periodtoken and the tv on the wall is always playing pop music videos periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   the menu is limited commatoken but the hummus commatoken salad commatoken homemade chips and yeero as they call it are all pretty good periodtoken i saw a sign the other day that they have added falafel to the menu  its about time   the staff has always been very friendly and helpful periodtoken one employee recognized us and somehow remembered that a few weeks before we had ordered the same thing and brought us samples of a couple of different things to try while we waited periodtoken hopefully she just has a really good memory and they dont just have that few customers   the menu seems to keep growing and it seems to be getting more popular commatoken so i may have to reevaluate after my next visit","8539":"came here for brunch on a monday by suggestion of one of the merchants across the street periodtoken i was one of two patrons so the bartender was very attentive although the food was still slow to arrive

good commatoken its cute to keep the core periodtoken i want to like the place because i think its great that they opened up a bakery on cherokee street periodtoken   second impression commatoken the girl working behind the counter this last saturday is not really the best person to represent whisk periodtoken she did not go out of her way to be personable commatoken didnt smile commatoken in fact didnt say much of anything periodtoken  maybe she was the last choice because everyone else was working at the best of missouri at mobot periodtoken  we both chose the blueberry scone commatoken it was pretty darn good periodtoken  i would definitely stop back into whisk to sample more of their sweets periodtoken","8549":"the diner experience in a space that feels nothing like a diner periodtoken  the best dish that mtjic serves up is the cajun turkey meatloaf periodtoken  it is a large portion on top of mash potatoes and they serve it up with a whole head of steamed broccoli periodtoken  the grilled cheese was also tasty with a cup of tomato bisque commatoken the french fries were really good commatoken thin commatoken perfectly fried and delicious periodtoken  the service is friendly but during the dinner rush commatoken was a bit on the slow side periodtoken","8551":"ive been coming here for years and its usually a good place commatoken but this past trip was

coworker commatoken yall needed a hashbrown 15 minutes after my order was placed she got around to my hashbrown periodtoken they gave me an extra hash brown with a sorry about that periodtoken i dont care for extra food periodtoken at a 15 minute wait commatoken with 8 customers coming and going in that time commatoken refund my meal or give me a comp on the next periodtoken  terrible periodtoken","8554":"tasted pretty good periodtoken however commatoken for 11 the portion size of my brisket sandwich was far too small periodtoken","8557":"let me just start with periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this place has the best cannolies periodtoken they are delish and made with fresh ricotta cheese commatoken which is the only reason ill go back periodtoken but the service is thumbs down periodtoken the host commatoken probably owners son commatoken was rude and texting on his phone during our whole meal periodtoken mind you there for some reason was a host on every wing of the restaurant commatoken equaling 3 my aunt asked for lemons and he referred us to our waiter periodtoken our waiter was ok but was in a rush with every request periodtoken seems that quality over quantity was not his goal periodtoken we sat a bit after to digest and finish our drinks periodtoken they were like hawks to our check periodtoken after returning to give him a cash tip in hand periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken my girlfriend noticed the waiter rolls his eyes to the host in response to i guess the amount of our 15 tip periodtoken we usually will tip over

this place for dinner  a show periodtoken they had a package with the sketch players periodtoken its a great idea dinner  a show periodtoken it was not understood exactly at first that the show wasnt there we had to go someplace else but that was ok periodtoken   all the people that were there for the dinner  show made it rather loud periodtoken it has a quaint ambiance hence the name it was a train station periodtoken with the old fashioned high ceilings  tile floors made it hard for conversation periodtoken also the large glass windows made it unbearable to see with a low setting bright sun periodtoken so if any thought could be put into some acoustical tiles or some sun glare help with the glass without taking away from the charm it would be a bonus periodtoken  onto the food periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i had the herb encrusted sirloin of beef  sliced tenderloin served on a bed of wild mushrooms topped with the chefs signature b\u00e9arnaise sauce it was very good periodtoken the beef was tender but could have used a few more potatoes periodtoken i got 2 wedges periodtoken maybe even a mashed potatoes  my husband had stuffed salmon florentine  fresh farm raised salmon stuffed with crabmeat and baby spinach commatoken lightly dusted with ritz crackers and topped with hollandaise sauce periodtoken he said it was ehhh ok i tasted it commatoken  it was awful according to me periodtoken it was like a mrs pauls frozen something or other periodtoken i would think even if they did a fried flounder or something there it would be better then this frozen item they just stuck in the oven periodtoken there was a mix up with our order periodtoken we were there for this large event so the restaurant was packed with trying to get us to the show on time they somehow missed our ticket periodtoken the manager came over  apologized  then our order came out quickly periodtoken which may or may not have attributed to the fish maybe not being done periodtoken it wasnt hot it was only room temperature periodtoken we would try it again on a less busy night to consider possibly a better rating periodtoken however commatoken we probably still wouldnt recommend the fish","8566":"a nice little ice creamdessert shop next to coccos pizza periodtoken theres a fair selection of homemade gelato and its ok commatoken but honestly you can find much better downtown periodtoken they have a wide variety of other desserts as well commatoken including ice cream commatoken cakes commatoken cookies commatoken etc periodtoken oh commatoken and coffee who doesnt love coffee with dessert  the decor is cute with ice cream parlour wireback chairs commatoken tables and a comfy couch to cuddle up on while you eat your sweet treat periodtoken its nice to have a convenient place to satisfy your sweet tooth instead of just grabbing a pint of ice cream at wawa periodtoken","8567":"wrong brewery for a margarita  i was beered out from a bbq the day before commatoken but wife and i wanted to sit outside and enjoy a margarita with lunch periodtoken the only quality tequila they had was patron commatoken so thats what wife and i ordered periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the drinks came out extremely watered down periodtoken but commatoken it was hot commatoken we were thirsty commatoken we had committed to tequila commatoken so we ordered a second round periodtoken when i got the bill commatoken those tequilaflavored glasses of water were periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken14 each a bev total of 56 for four drinks  serves me right for ordering a margarita at a brewery periodtoken but commatoken if a place cant do it right commatoken why bother even offering it   the food is good and the staff is friendly periodtoken the deck could use a little more charm and shade during the day periodtoken and commatoken 14 for a high quality margarita might be fair in new york city periodtoken however commatoken margaritawater in carmel might be worth a fiver even if it is patron periodtoken","8569":"went for dinner periodtoken great reviews periodtoken   pricey but food was good so i didnt care periodtoken   our waitress omg  she repeated

periodtoken i ate here last weekend and sat at the bar periodtoken great bartenders and service was on point this night up until lets just say a very unexpected experience for the entire bar periodtoken i have never experienced anything like this and was not expecting it from granite city as i consider it one of the more classy establishments but i guess being next to a hotel you never know what people could frequent there periodtoken out of nowhere the entire bar hears people screaming specifically one lady periodtoken now i have no idea what was going on as i was adjacent at the bar but it escalated quickly periodtoken the blonde bartender says she is going to get the manager and quickly after the manager appears behind the bar periodtoken the lady is cussing at the manager and bartender yelling distracting everyone periodtoken the manager was a young woman i dont recall her name but is there every time i have ever been in the building periodtoken she tells her bartender that its ok she would handle things and could tell her first concern was that bartender was ok periodtoken i was pleasantly surprised by that periodtoken then proceeds to get yelled at by lady and man which i assumed to be the ladys husband or boyfriend periodtoken the manager is calm the whole time asking them to calm down but they refused periodtoken mind you this has been going on for several minutes and she finally asks them to leave periodtoken the manager remained professional and polite meanwhile being cussed at repeatedly periodtoken i can not hear every word as i was not directly beside the people but she did ask them to leave and the man wanted to talk to another manager periodtoken there was a man standing around watching and come to find out this was the general manager periodtoken he was watching this happen and did not speak up until man requested another manager and thats when the lady pointed him in the man general managers direction periodtoken being a man and finding out the general manager who is also a man was letting his female staff be yelled at and cussed is what drove me to leaving this review periodtoken now i do not know what the general manager said to this man because they went outside to talk but the man came back in and had a margarita at the bar after he was asked to leave by the other manager periodtoken how does that work is my question the young woman manager apologized to the bar for the disruption and asked if there was anything she could do before she walked away periodtoken i have never experienced anything like this like i prior stated periodtoken i would have thought the young woman was general manager by how the situation was handled periodtoken i wrote this review not to scrutinize anyone but hope someone of higher power sees this and finds out what is going on in that place with upper management periodtoken again restaurant is great and never have had any complaints periodtoken just this weekend was out of the usual for this place periodtoken","8576":"2 star food commatoken 5 star service periodtoken could get better food else where periodtoken i ordered my food and it was at my table so fast you

menu coming up soon and the positive spin one of the djs gave commatoken i thought id try one for lunch periodtoken   i ordered a mcrib combo meal with a small french fry and small coke periodtoken kevin the dj commatoken said he orders his without pickle and onions periodtoken i like pickles and onions commatoken so i kept them on mine periodtoken im glad that i did commatoken the bun along with the crisp pickles and onions were the best thing about the sandwich periodtoken the processed meat was tasteless commatoken it was over sauced with a bbq that was way to sweet periodtoken i thank my luck stars that i had an order of fries periodtoken i only wished i had upgraded to a larger size to fill the void left by a flavorless sandwich periodtoken   this is a very clean and friendly mcdonalds periodtoken i will not lower their star rating due to a seasonal sandwich that i did not enjoy periodtoken however commatoken i would not recommend a mcrib to anyone commatoken not even my worst enemy periodtoken","8579":"we came here on saturday morning commatoken expected to have a small wait periodtoken food however is average and service also very average definitely not an exceptional breakfast place","8580":"i had the most fabulous salt caramel shake last night periodtoken it was excellent periodtoken perfect periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni only wish i had ordered the large periodtoken i will be back for sure for another one of these shakes periodtoken  i met a friend here for dinner periodtoken we both ordered the hamburger commatoken fries commatoken onion rings and the date salad periodtoken   the burgers were nothing special periodtoken i was asked how i wanted it cooked and i said medium and it came out well done commatoken i still ate it periodtoken it was kind of on the cold side and the bun was too chewy and not very fresh periodtoken the fries were ok commatoken nothing special periodtoken my friend had the onion rings and i tasted one which was great periodtoken   since i was paying commatoken  i thought over 50 bucks for a very mediocre simple dinner for 2 with the main course being hamburger was a bit stiff periodtoken  also commatoken and im being a bit of a snob commatoken i know commatoken but youd think with all the floor to ceiling windows they would keep them clean periodtoken they were filthy everyone of them periodtoken and commatoken while im at it commatoken i also thought the seating was a bit uncomfortable periodtoken who the hell wants to sit at a picnic table to eat inside   i will be back for the shake but nothing

were so excited when culvers was being built but working in food service as managers we didnt get a chance to try you guys out until today periodtoken   got a warm welcome from employees that were leaving but a bare stare as we were asking questions at the register periodtoken so we figured out the menu ourselves because we would of just got yes or no answers periodtoken    was excited about the cheese churd and they were very delicious periodtoken i had the the melt and very good but a little greasy for my taste periodtoken  as a manager i know customer service should be number one and the presence of a manager is very important and talking to new guest and building a relationship with the guest should be top of the list periodtoken","8590":"i personally thought the buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious periodtoken it was spicy periodtoken bread was hot periodtoken service is fairly quick periodtoken but commatoken my friend got food poisoned here after eating their mashed potatoes commatoken so i gotta reduce the rating periodtoken i actually avoided coming here for as long as possible since i hated the name periodtoken haha","8591":"a few people here said they thought the place was overpriced commatoken i have to disagree periodtoken overall i thought the prices were fair periodtoken  the service left me more to be desired but that a different thing altogether periodtoken   i think i paid around 20 for a dinner and a dessert periodtoken granted it might have been a little more if the waitress had come back to take my drink order as i wanted to wait to try a friends beverage before i ordered it periodtoken the wine prices were on par commatoken we were looking at the list and nothing stood out as over what you would expect to pay for wine in a restaurant periodtoken   as for the food i really enjoyed it commatoken i also got their cr\u00e8me brulee and that was particularly good periodtoken  one of the nice things was the glassware they had periodtoken a friend ordered a lambic and it came in the frambrose glass commatoken which was cool since you dont normally see them as much periodtoken","8592":"tacos are decent but small and not nearly as flavorful or zesty as some other options in the nashville area periodtoken the best part about this place is the space itself and the margaritas which are made super quickly at their little bar  i keep coming back to this place because its so quaint and casual periodtoken","8593":"i have reviewed this once before commatoken but for some reason the review is no longer here periodtoken  so i will try again periodtoken  the food is ok commatoken i have found the meat philly cheese steak and pulled pork to be tasty commatoken but grisilly periodtoken  one of the best things about this place is the coke dispenser  you can get just about any flavor of soda you can imagine periodtoken i like sarah found the front counter help commatoken not so helpful  no hello or welcome commatoken it appears that you have to interact with them first before you can get someone to talk to you periodtoken","8594":"went on a weekday to avoid the reported long line as reported on weekends periodtoken the service was very good and attentive periodtoken the food didnt knock my socks off but it was good i cant remember what it was called but i got the chefs special that was some kind of loaded hash brown periodtoken large portion periodtoken the cheese on top tasted processed and cheap periodtoken wasnt the same as left overs periodtoken too hard and chewy periodtoken my friend got eggs bacon and a sweet potato pancake periodtoken it was the same as any other restaurant but what she ordered was pretty basic periodtoken i couldnt really tell a difference that the pancake was sweet potato periodtoken just tasted like a pancake periodtoken she agreed periodtoken  i was surprised it looks so outdated inside to be such a famous little place making a lot of money periodtoken it just felt kind of generic periodtoken  had i stood in line for a long time commatoken i wouldnt say it was worth the wait periodtoken guess i expected more due to the hype periodtoken maybe i ordered the wrong thing periodtoken all in all commatoken i would go again if someone insisted on eating there and try something different periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut only on a weekday periodtoken","8596":"5 stars for the really great use of the developmenthistorical and industrialcrafty d\u00e9cor commatoken and for the attentive wait staff periodtoken  however commatoken i feel compared to other cafes with similar food this place was not as flavorful commatoken or filling commatoken and overpriced periodtoken i should have ordered the goddess salad i guess  i ordered the spring roll salad because i love spring rolls and thought there might be similar flavorings  no periodtoken   really beautiful commatoken but i guess i was expecting more  like a spring roll on top commatoken or seasoned noodles or something periodtoken  yes commatoken i doused it in the thin dressing commatoken but added lots of sriracha commatoken salt and pepper commatoken but i disappointing commatoken for 10 periodtoken  i was still hungry commatoken so i ordered the peanut butter shake with almond milk  needed better blending and more thickness especially for 6 periodtoken   periodtoken  i think pictures on the menu would help in the future periodtoken","8601":"super bummed to drive all the way from greenwood to tjs for pumpkin spiced cookie butter to find out that they no long had

periodtoken5 periodtoken  hard to judge because when i walked in on a midsaturday afternoon commatoken the place was surprisingly packed periodtoken  im talking like wall to wall filipinos commatoken with the occasional white boyfriend lurking on the sidelines periodtoken  wow commatoken youre doing great i said to the cashier periodtoken  oh commatoken its for a life celebration for a dead person commatoken she said blithely periodtoken  i paid my 12 and shuffled slowly towards the buffet line periodtoken  there were about 10 people in front of me and wouldnt you know commatoken i got the last clean plate but the steam table trays were completely emptied out periodtoken  we had to wait about 15 minutes for more food to slowly trickle in commatoken so i only got to try a few dishes periodtoken    as usual commatoken none of the dishes were labeled periodtoken  apparently commatoken theres an unwritten rule in every frigging filipino restaurant to have unlabeled food items which assumes 1 youre filipino or know some and automatically can identify the dishes  just by sight or smell and 2 your restaurant staff enjoy being asked 987 times a day commatoken what is that  here are the dishes i was able to try  lechon  sliced pork belly fried to a crisp periodtoken  nicely proportioned with not too much fat periodtoken  crunchy and delicious periodtoken  kare kare  this is a filipino stew that is a staple periodtoken  its got peanut butter in it and the universal standard is using oxtail as the main meat commatoken but here they chintzed out and used thinly sliced steak periodtoken  veggies included eggplant and baby bok choy periodtoken  tasty but a bit too much peanut flavor than what my mom usually uses periodtoken  flan  a simple custard periodtoken  flavorful periodtoken  jasmine rice  fresh commatoken hot and moist periodtoken  i hate dry rice periodtoken   i did see that others had on their plates pancit and lumpia commatoken but i didnt feel like waiting around for the food to come back on the steam trays periodtoken  overall commatoken good decent filipino food periodtoken  i just need to come back on a normal day periodtoken","8613":"is the egg white delight mcmuffin commatoken delightfully delicious yes commatoken if you add franks hot sauce periodtoken   when you break down the nutrition facts and compare the new egg white to the regular mcmuffin commatoken there really isnt that much of a difference periodtoken you save 50 calories and 5 grams of fat ordering the ew periodtoken ordering the regular egg mcmuffin you lose 1 gram of fiber and get 20 mg less of sodium periodtoken if you count points on the weight watchers program commatoken a regular mcmuffin is 8 points and the new egg white is 7 periodtoken one point is not that big of a savings periodtoken the egg whites and white cheddar is not exclusive to the mcmuffin commatoken you can try it on any egg  cheese sandwich periodtoken which means commatoken you can have it your way periodtoken oh wait commatoken that is another burger joints phrase periodtoken   normally i am not a fan of mcdonalds commatoken but this one is close to work and surprisingly is

pineapple commatoken oreo commatoken blueberry cheesecake commatoken banana nut crunch commatoken and barts revenge to name a few  but the prices are pretty high periodtoken we got 6 donuts and a small bottle of milk for 14 periodtoken my favorite donut was the mango pineapple periodtoken dont get me wrong commatoken i would never say no to the sweet ones but they involved a thick layer of frosting which made them pretty heavy to eat periodtoken i mainly came here looking for the famed gooey butter cake donut but sadly they didnt have them that day periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenperhaps i will venture back in hopes of tasting that strange strange donut periodtoken","8616":"i have been here a few times commatoken due to its close proximity to where i live

twice they were out of cilantro i love cilantro and basically use pho as a vessel for it periodtoken today i was told they were out by my waiter so i decided to pack everything up and go home commatoken where the cilantro is plentiful periodtoken then suddenly commatoken someone found some cilantro periodtoken dude just didnt want to miss whatever was playing in his phone long enough to ask periodtoken also commatoken they are right next to rouses where bunches cilantro is about a dollar periodtoken i just dont get it periodtoken","8618":"this is probably the worst place ive been to in a bit periodtoken such potential wasted commatoken  as the concept is really nice periodtoken  the woman who took our order  had the worst attitude periodtoken we experienced quite a few issues

professional demeanor made me change my review from a 1 to a 3 periodtoken","8619":"hey periodtoken periodtoken great place to get seafood commatoken but not very service driven literally had to drive over not once commatoken but twice to place an order for live crawfish because time and time again commatoken they will not answer their damn phone once inside commatoken i could still hear the phone ringing and no one attempting to answer it and it wasnt due to being inundated with customers periodtoken here is a hint periodtoken periodtoken dont keep aggravating people because eventually commatoken they will find another place to go for me commatoken it is a proximity issue and they really do have a good selection and quality seafood commatoken but i am very turned off by businesses

hour and a half from walking in the door to getting my ice cream in hand periodtoken my end of line wasnt at the door at the time so those people had to have waited longer periodtoken   yes commatoken its brand new and theres nothing like it yet elsewise commatoken so theres the justification of the hype periodtoken  at least i talked to everyone waiting in line around me commatoken  we were all in the same boat   it was really good when i finally got my order periodtoken it was 11 kaka crunchy with nutella and cereal ice cream and my toppings were kit kat commatoken m and m commatoken and fresh

food is good for santa barbara commatoken mediocre at best for la commatoken but the service is seriously lacking periodtoken  i have been coming to this restaurant for years commatoken due in large part to the sheer lack of dining options in this town commatoken and have noticed a steady decline in the service periodtoken given the restaurants outrageous prices commatoken the consistently rude commatoken condescending commatoken and apathetic staff is entirely atrocious and unacceptable periodtoken for instance commatoken last night i made a specific request when ordering for the chef not to include a particular ingredient in my meal because of a food allergy periodtoken lo and behold commatoken my food came out and of course had the ingredient i had begged them not to put in it periodtoken rather than apologizing for the mistake commatoken the rude blonde waitress looked at me as if it were my fault and said commatoken well i made a note but they include it in the sauce so next time you should specify periodtoken she went on to defend her mistake in a very condescending manner periodtoken     bottom line horrendous service commatoken mediocre food commatoken and outrageous prices and its only getting worse periodtoken   santa barbara needs more choices stat periodtoken","8623":"ive never seen a super center that is this small periodtoken  it lacks a cohesive plus size clothing center  heck what used to be their plus wear is mostly clearance now periodtoken  they do have a decent electronics department commatoken if you have an iphone periodtoken a fairly ok selection of health  beauty periodtoken  but this is mostly a walmart if you need to quick stop periodtoken theres a real super center 20 minutes away on sr54 or just up the road on alderman periodtoken","8624":"their tacos were great commatoken but their sauce was poor and less than mediocre periodtoken i asked for real mexican hot sauce and they gave me their homemade  stuff periodtoken

figure out what i wanted and gave me so much info in such a professional way commatoken with tasteful humor here and there periodtoken she seemed so passionate and genuine periodtoken after i ordered commatoken she asked if i was new to the area and then explained the lunch card system periodtoken somehow commatoken in todays society commatoken customer service has died a little periodtoken erin reminded me how it should be periodtoken she made me feels so comfortable and gave me an urge to want to come back periodtoken   heres why i gave sofresh 3 starts instead of 5 april 7 commatoken 2017i enjoyed my first experience so much that i had to bring my girlfriend back to show her this new amazing place i found periodtoken the experience was nothing like the first periodtoken we walked in the door and the girl at the counter didnt great us periodtoken she continued do whatever it was she was doing periodtoken i started to feel as if we were a bother and maybe should go periodtoken finally the young commatoken blonde girl looked up and said hey commatoken then put something in her mouth and was chewing periodtoken i again felt as if i was interrupting and didnt want to bother her while she was eating periodtoken once i noticed she was done chewing i grabbed her attention she never asked us what we would like to order and began ordering periodtoken my girlfriend began ordering and these two guys walked in her friends periodtoken one guy screened this very loud sofresh jingle he i guess came up up with and immediately the young commatoken blonde girls attention was gone periodtoken she kept looking at them and laughing and barely even listening to us periodtoken making us repeat ourselves over and over periodtoken then one guy took out his phone and took a picture with a flash periodtoken he must have not known his flash was on and then started explaining he was taking a picture of her periodtoken it made us feel very uncomfortable and it was as if he was taking a picture of us periodtoken we are a sane sex couple and have experienced males tormenting us periodtoken even if it wasnt us he was taking a picture of commatoken it still made us feel uncomfortable and the possibility of our picture going around with peoples awful comments periodtoken then when we were trying to close out the order commatoken my girlfriend said shed like everything wrapped to go commatoken the girl started charging us for a wrap togo periodtoken she again wasnt listening to us periodtoken i saw erin come out and began asking her questions periodtoken i wanted to make sure our order was right because i had such little faith in the young blonde girl periodtoken plus commatoken as uncomfortable as i was commatoken i knew talking with erin and id feel a little more comfortable periodtoken erin made sure i got everything correct with the anthonys i wanted on the side periodtoken we decided to eat a little bit in the store and take the rest home periodtoken though we should have left periodtoken as we sat there and ate commatoken we saw erin work so hard periodtoken she was refilling napkins commatoken cleaning tables commatoken and do all kinds of things periodtoken she never stopped working periodtoken the blonde girl sat there and talked with her friends who were very obnoxious periodtoken we watched him swipe a cookie from the counter right in front of her and she did nothing periodtoken then drunk people started coming in and thats when we said enough was enough periodtoken why are people drunk at 8pm but thats another issue unrelated to this periodtoken   now for the food periodtoken oh my goodness commatoken it is amazing periodtoken both times i have gotten the build your own bowl and i just cant handle how amazing it is periodtoken everything is so refreshing periodtoken its light and full of body fuel periodtoken we came the second time after a workout and that salmon was orgasmic periodtoken their seasoning isnt over the top periodtoken its very simple periodtoken just enough to taste and makes the everything go down easy periodtoken   however commatoken after this horrible second experience commatoken we are very hesitant to return periodtoken","8635":"i had previously visited the depot for drinks and wanted to taste some dishes on their menu periodtoken i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and was not impressed periodtoken the meat lacked flavour and the barbecue sauce provided was less than ideal periodtoken i felt the combination of the two was average at best periodtoken on top of the sandwich commatoken the sweet potato fries were lacking in the sweet flavor i hoped to enjoy periodtoken in all honesty i would stick to the brews on tap and come for happy hour drinks periodtoken","8638":"we stopped in to earl of sandwich and it is really similar to a soup and sandwich chain that you would expect like panera periodtoken   i got the combo with half sandwich and half soup and they were both fine periodtoken i got the roastbeef with horseradish sauce periodtoken food came out pretty quick and was standard slightly high mall prices periodtoken  the regular sandwich looks like its definitely big enough for 2 people to share periodtoken","8639":"i have now been to baileys range 4 times periodtoken  each time i have ordered something different commatoken but all 4 times my medium burger has come over way over cooked periodtoken  yesterday commatoken 3 of us ordered our burgers medium commatoken 1 came out medium rare and the other 2 were very well done periodtoken  i am not one to send something back commatoken but it shocks me that a burger place cannot get the cook of a burger correct periodtoken   that being said commatoken their fries are great and they have some of the best ice cream in the city commatoken which is why we have been several times now periodtoken","8644":"employees used to be always rude periodtoken but i can say ive never had my order messed up i usually just get a junior bacon cheeseburger commatoken small fry commatoken and occasionally a small chocolate frosty periodtoken ive been more recently and they have some new faces there commatoken

commatoken skin care commatoken etc section periodtoken christina from christina cooks does demonstration classes here that i have been to periodtoken great community message board periodtoken  hate  the stuff they sell is freakin expensive periodtoken sure commatoken the organic peppers are great commatoken but for 3 each ill go to the italian market and get 5 peppers for that price for that reason commatoken even though the produce always looks great commatoken i refuse to buy it there unless im desperate or its too cold to walk elsewhere periodtoken","8647":"they were out of multiple

dislike the smells of a pierwharf periodtoken  the seafood was decent commatoken though periodtoken  we got the special abalone and a crab sandwich to share periodtoken  the abalone was pretty good commatoken lightly battered and fried with some delist tomato basil rice periodtoken  i never realized how meaty abalone is periodtoken  and it was a good thing that there was a good amount of abalone commatoken because the crab sandwich was kinda pathetic periodtoken  there was barely any crab meat periodtoken  and for over 12 commatoken there better be huge crab chunks to make this girl happy periodtoken  overall commatoken go with the days specials periodtoken  because the regular menu items are probably not worth it periodtoken","8652":"this has a lot of potential commatoken but unfortunately falls short in a town thats regarded highly when it comes to cuban food periodtoken the chicken bowl was very basic commatoken over salted and overpriced periodtoken","8653":"ive been here twice and both times they have gotten my order wrong periodtoken  first time they gave me the wrong bahn mi periodtoken  i didnt notice it until i got home periodtoken  the second time i dined in and got the chicken curry with a boba and received the wrong boba periodtoken  they offered to get me another but said its fine periodtoken  the bahn mi was average periodtoken  they gave me i believe the pork so it was slightly on the dry side periodtoken  the curry was average also as the sauce was missing that depth in  flavor of a good curry sauce but hey this is a fast food type place so i wasnt expecting anything more periodtoken  i will return to try some more of their drink offerings","8654":"old church converted to coffee shoprestaurant in down town eagle periodtoken newly remodeled

the menu for first time commatoken and the chile relleno quiche sounded good periodtoken the quich was good commatoken but i was told it was layered with chilies saw a few diced pieces commatoken and covered in red sauce had a dollop periodtoken in any event commatoken it tasted like a quiche with a little ranchero sauce periodtoken guess i expected more flavor periodtoken i will try rembrandts again commatoken and give them another shot commatoken but probably not on a sunday afternoon periodtoken","8656":"the kinks need to be worked out periodtoken the service was not good periodtoken i can forgive that as it was very busy and they are still getting started periodtoken the drinks however werent that good periodtoken the bartender needs helps and like he was extremely overwhelmed

instagram  yes periodtoken do they have specials and showcase different breweries  yes periodtoken are they open late  yes periodtoken  that is what they are  not a true deli commatoken not a true beer store commatoken not a grocery story periodtoken  theyre your neighborhood goto spot for people who know nothing about beer to the people who consider themselves beer snobs periodtoken  there are often tastingssamples of different beer and there is almost always some sort of special going on periodtoken  overall commatoken its a solid place and a staple in our neighborhood commatoken especially in an area with so many byobs periodtoken","8665":"i do not know what the fuss about this place periodtoken okay commatoken it is big periodtoken they have variety of food commatoken mostly

they announced that they had ran out of lobster rolls periodtoken  what it was like 6pm commatoken dinner rush had barely started  it was the sole reason my friend wanted to come commatoken needless to say commatoken she was highly disappointed periodtoken  theres a of little shops on the wharf commatoken so if the wait is long commatoken theres plenty to explore periodtoken downside is

commatoken he gave us a really vague answer about how we could be up next or maybe another 20 minutes commatoken he didnt know periodtoken  thanks   after we were seated commatoken we ended up getting a clam chower bowl commatoken 2 crab sandwiches commatoken and a lobster linguini periodtoken  everything was average periodtoken  not someplace id recommend periodtoken","8671":"this place gets three stars for their amazing shakes way overpriced and for the goat cheese salad that i had periodtoken  there cucumber ranch is fantastic periodtoken    the interior is very modern and interesting periodtoken  there is a long table when you walk in that can have you sit as though you are eating european style next to a stranger periodtoken  they have fresh flowers on the tables commatoken and if you eat downstairs you can watch every aspect of the kitchen including washing dishes periodtoken    the hamburgers are lacking flavor and their house ketchups are disgusting also lacking flavor periodtoken  if you do however commatoken want a bison commatoken lamb commatoken any kind of meat burger this is the place for you periodtoken  the pepperjack goat cheese is very peppery almost too much to eat for my taste periodtoken  if you are downtown and want to pay for a 1215 burger this is the place for you   if you are downtown and want a great shake that is chunky this is a great stop

would never buy seafood or meat here  items like purdue chickenturkey where you know the items have been packaged securely and cannot be reopened are ok periodtoken the deli counter is the slowest

ordered for a pickup periodtoken    on the phone commatoken i asked about the hotness of their wings periodtoken  see commatoken i like a little spicy commatoken but not a lot  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i like the flavor of hot sauce and chicken commatoken and a bit of heat  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but im not a fan of needing a fire hose commatoken either periodtoken  so commatoken anyhow commatoken i asked and she said they do different heat levels periodtoken  i asked for the mildest hot wings periodtoken  i also ordered a chicken burger for my wife which was supposed to come with a large ortega chili roasted on it periodtoken  when picking up the food commatoken the atmosphere was okay periodtoken  they had a few locals that were drinking there but otherwise it was very empty periodtoken  i kind of felt out of place periodtoken  when getting home and digging in to our food commatoken the first thing i realized was  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken my mouth was on fire periodtoken  like commatoken o periodtokenm periodtokeng periodtoken commatoken why is satan dancing on my tongue  i pushed through it though periodtoken  the flavor of the sauce and the chicken was there commatoken and i appreciated that the wings werent scrawny  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken good meat on each of em  but the heat periodtoken  dear lord commatoken the heat  somehow i did it commatoken i finished them all commatoken but i would regret it the rest of the night periodtoken  oh commatoken i forgot commatoken i also had a cheeseburger periodtoken  there wasnt anything special with it commatoken it was rather ordinary periodtoken  certainly not bad though periodtoken  my wifes chilichicken burger was okay i had a bite but lacking some flavor periodtoken  my wife commented on it commatoken too  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken she said the ortega chili was mostly tasteless but the chicken itself was alright periodtoken  thats about it periodtoken  i dont have much else to say periodtoken  i really should eat there again commatoken try some different things periodtoken  ill have to remember theyre there periodtoken  ps they often have some sweet cars sitting outside their place  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken hot vettes commatoken vws commatoken woodys commatoken etc periodtoken  love driving by there periodtoken","8728":"i have a certain lovehate relationship with baileys range periodtoken it has a lot of positive qualities commatoken but theres also plenty of negatives periodtoken ive been here twice with the beautiful wife commatoken so its time to write a review periodtoken rather than writing some gripping story commatoken lets just hit some points periodtoken ill also say that this could have just as easily been a 4 star review periodtoken but for the price commatoken ill keep it at three periodtoken  the good 1 weve only been here in the evening for dinner commatoken but service has been really good periodtoken weve also sat upstairs both times more about that later periodtoken we also appreciated a visit by gene bailey manager and brother of owner dave commatoken where we were able to give some feedback  2 the two burgers that ive had pbj pesto commatoken goat cheese commatoken tomato jam on a bison patty and the ozark ozark mushrooms commatoken caramelized onions commatoken and goat cheese have both been great periodtoken lots of lots with a good amount of toppings  3 the flavor of the shakes  weve had the irish coffee delicious and the sweet sweet bacon bourbon commatoken candied bacon commatoken salted caramel ice cream periodtoken if youre a fan of pulp fiction commatoken youll remember vincent commenting about the 5 milkshake periodtoken do they put bourbon in this one oh yes they do periodtoken and is this a good milkshake nay commatoken its a a pretty fucking good milkshake  4 the beer list  theyre keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap  5 the house made pickles and catsup commatoken the fries commatoken the smoked onion rings  i enjoyed all of them  the not so good  1 price  especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages commatoken you can rack up some stupid bills periodtoken the two times weve been there weve ended up with hefty bills with tip commatoken over 90 each time periodtoken i guess if youre a lets split a burger commatoken an order fries commatoken and have one soda each type of couple commatoken youll be able to walk out of there for 20 periodtoken but commatoken youre not much fun either periodtoken so live with that periodtoken  2 the consistency of the shakes  id put the irish coffee shake up there with anything that kota or the fountain offers commatoken but at baileys range commatoken theyre just too thin periodtoken i know that kota bought some uber shake machine commatoken and while im not buying one for them commatoken at some point commatoken they should upgrade  3 the cheese curds  i like cheese curds commatoken but admittedly commatoken i expected fried cheese curds periodtoken instead commatoken these are fresh periodtoken so wisconsinites commatoken youve been warned periodtoken  4 the rest of the alcoholic drink menu  just havent been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered periodtoken for instance commatoken the bermuda is pretty much a dark  stormy with passion fruit nectar periodtoken but as presented commatoken all you tasted was the passion fruit periodtoken other drinks tasted more fruitylight commatoken but then again commatoken when youve gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time commatoken its probably my palate periodtoken  5 the carolina burger topped with smoked pork shoulder commatoken house bbq sauce commatoken sweet  spicy slaw was so drenched in bbq sauce that you couldnt taste anything else periodtoken the sauce was wonderful commatoken but if you really want this burger commatoken get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on periodtoken  i really want to love baileys range  but that doesnt mean that i hate it periodtoken more that i was hoping it would be a place where wed go on a tuesday night when we dont feel like cooking periodtoken instead commatoken it feels more like a well come here once a month periodtoken","8729":"so i am a boba snob periodtoken i grew up in the bay area and by far i think the best taro milk tea comes from fantasia periodtoken they use real taro and its not that lilac purple like places that use powder periodtoken  look at some taro some day commatoken it is off white  anyways commatoken no one does real taro milk tea and bings is no exception periodtoken i was really hoping they might since they are next to a huge asian supermarket where they can buy some taro commatoken but alas commatoken they use the purple powder stuff periodtoken  i got a regular milk tea and something just wasnt right with it periodtoken  not sure if theyre using a powdered tea for that too  it didnt taste like brewed tea for sure and i make a better milk tea at home with trader joes unsweetened black tea and some half and half periodtoken  however commatoken ill give them props for knowing how to cook the boba really well periodtoken  i just hope they arent buying boba from next door in lee lees because their boba comes from china which commatoken really commatoken the rule should just be dont buy anything processed or manufactured in china if youre going to consume it periodtoken  if their boba comes from taiwan i will return a lot more often periodtoken  i forgot to ask when i was there but ill double check next time periodtoken  they were a little on the slow side periodtoken an original milk tea shouldnt take almost 10 minutes to put together periodtoken but they have a huge selection if youre into slushes and snows and they rotate seasonal flavors i guess periodtoken  only time can tell if i end up craving bings when im all done with work periodtoken","8730":"ordered poopoo plater for myself periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeninsert joke here periodtoken it was very good the lo mein was boring periodtoken its not fancy its a basic takeout joint periodtoken","8731":"not many togo choices in terminal d periodtoken all of them are pretty bad commatoken so get something to eat before you enter the terminal commatoken if possible periodtoken  if you are unfortunately already stuck in the terminal and dont have time for a sit down meal commatoken i recommend cheesecake scoop for a quick bite periodtoken they have readymade wraps and salads periodtoken the shrimp louis sandwich was good periodtoken i was worried about the quality of shrimp commatoken but it was fine periodtoken they didnt give me enough salad dressing  which looks like a thick thousand island periodtoken  i suppose they are better known for their unique way of serving cheescake  scooped and served into a cup periodtoken the idea is cool commatoken but i have yet to try it periodtoken","8732":"ive been wanting to try this bakery for a while after seeing the incredible pictures on their website periodtoken i finally was able to stop in when i was in the city periodtoken i was pretty disappointed at how limited the selection was periodtoken everything i asked for they claimed was at other locations or they didnt have periodtoken i opted for the carrot cake and eclair which were both yummy but nothing extraordinary periodtoken","8733":"the food was really good and the waitress was very kind periodtoken but i cant help but feel that the structure of the kitchen needs to be worked in periodtoken the food didnt come together periodtoken there were multiple mistakes with our orders and the waitress kept apologizing periodtoken it could be either of the cook or waitresss fault but regardless i probably wouldnt come here by choice again periodtoken the food did taste good periodtoken it just took a very long time to come to the table","8734":"not bad for a brazilian steakhouse in tampa if this were in a city such as chicago or san francisco commatoken where there are more brazilian steakhouses commatoken this would probably be average or below average periodtoken  ive been there two times so far and i find that their salad bar which includes smoked salmon commatoken cheeses commatoken and some warm items is more exciting than their meat selections periodtoken  of course commatoken youre coming here for the meat and id rate the meat quality and taste commatoken 7 periodtoken5  8 periodtoken0 out of 10 periodtoken    i was disappointed to learn that boizao does not serve plantains periodtoken instead commatoken they serve breaded fried banana periodtoken  my guess is that they do this because bananas are much cheaper periodtoken     they also do not serve baked pineapple which is purported to have enzymes to help with digesting meat periodtoken  if they can add plantains and pineapple commatoken id give it 4 stars periodtoken    for dinner commatoken expect to spend at least 60 dollars a person periodtoken","8737":"this is a beautiful hotel periodtoken the ambiance is very romantic and quaint periodtoken the hotel sits right in the heart of the french quarter and is within easy walking distance to all of the tourist sites and other notable locations within the city periodtoken the hotel does offer a continental breakfast that is not bad for what it is periodtoken its pretty much the standard fare of eggs commatoken pancakes commatoken sausage commatoken bacon commatoken potatoes or grits depending on the day periodtoken they also have a wide selection of other breakfast items should you not like the hot food choices periodtoken the rooms are elegant and cozy but are a little on the small side which is fine periodtoken i also greatly appreciated that the floors were marble or some facsimile which meant you did not have to worry about what may be living in the carpet of the room periodtoken it is a decent place to stay but i think the negatives do out weigh the positives periodtoken  so what are the negatives periodtoken first off if you have a rental car you will need to pay a huge fee of 36 dollars a day in order to have it parked for you periodtoken it is true that the hotel is very good about getting the car for you when you need it and then parking it again when you are done periodtoken where the shock with the parking comes from the fact that you are charged a tax on each of those days that it has been parked so in reality the parking of the care is not 36 but 40 dollars a day periodtoken this is something that really needs to be placed on their website so that people know periodtoken the second really bad thing was the housekeeping periodtoken we came bake early one of the days and the room was not completed so the housekeeper asked us if we could wait periodtoken we said it was no problem at all and for her to take her time periodtoken well she made up the room but took a huge shortcut on making the bed periodtoken the bed has a duvet on it and instead of putting the duvet in a cover she just wrapped it in two sheets periodtoken so we had they nasty duvet touching our skin because she neglected to give us a sheet to use to cover our selves periodtoken we also noted that the headboard seems to never get dusted or cleaned as we found some disgusting stuff on top of it periodtoken the alarm clock in the room is very dated and while it is mentioned that you can use an ipod for your alarm that will only work if you have the older version of the ipod periodtoken it is not able to use the newer ones periodtoken the last thing that really upset us is that we booked our vacation on travelocity as a package so we know that the room was at a discounted rate periodtoken we felt like we were penalized for this because we were placed in this back area that seemed like it was empty except for us and we had to walk up and down 25 stairs to get to and from our room periodtoken it was not until the weekend that we noticed others that were also placed in the back area with us and one guest was so upset with the bedding that they threw it outside their room periodtoken   all in all it was an okay hotel but not one that i would check into again periodtoken","8741":"clean and semiempty on july 4 during their limited opening hours periodtoken got the 3 frap promo of double fudge bar for me and caramel waffle cone for the friend periodtoken the caramel waffle cone was too sweet for my liking and same with the double fudge bar periodtoken such have stuck with my usual green tea frap commatoken but this is the point of these 3frap promofor you to try something out of your comfort zone periodtoken  anyway commatoken the milks were empty and i placed them at the starbucks counter and notified the staff to replaced them periodtoken after 30 minutes commatoken they did no such thing periodtoken at least they have nice tables where you can do your laptop work commatoken but no plugs near the tables periodtoken","8742":"more than just ice cream  the place is ok periodtoken  i mean it is nothing to rave on about periodtoken  it is a decent consistent place that has been a staple in philadelphia for years periodtoken     turkey burger  probably one of the best you can get periodtoken  chicken salad sandwich  very good cosmopolitan salad  seriously needs an update deserts  are once again ok periodtoken   we recently had their over priced pumpkin pie and it was decent periodtoken    also the waiters there seem to be on another planet some days periodtoken   will i go again  yes commatoken it is a nice place to meet and grab a quick meal or ice cream periodtoken  bathrooms were not clean periodtoken","8743":"this place is decent for fruits commatoken veggies commatoken some grains commatoken and international snacks periodtoken the food court is also alright but it really depends on the time of day periodtoken every time i go here i always see and smell rotten meat  beef commatoken pork and fish  commatoken so i would never trust the meat from this place periodtoken the aisles are small commatoken and if its busy people tend to be pushy and inconsiderate periodtoken if you know when the down times are commatoken then try to plan your visit around then periodtoken its bad enough that the parking lot for this shopping centre is always chaotic commatoken so there is a good chance you wont get a break from that once you get inside periodtoken","8744":"would only suggest coming here for a beer or when its slower periodtoken good beer commatoken but really slow service and just average food periodtoken","8748":"giving 3 stars commatoken i have been there 3 times commatoken 1st time would be 5 stars commatoken 2nd time 3 stars commatoken and 3rd time 1 star periodtoken 1st time we ate there but 2nd and 3rd we had takeout periodtoken i strongly suggest do not do takeout and if you do check your food this last time im glad i did commatoken i ordered cornbread and they gave me a really nasty looking old biscuit periodtoken i ordered an add on of burnt ends and there was 4 small pieces wth i went back in and manager corrected the mistake but he acted like it was no big deal periodtoken this was a to go order commatoken it has to be right i also received a smoked jalape\u00f1o with no bacon on it on 2nd visit periodtoken overall good food if your order is correct periodtoken","8752":"i was mildly disappointed by my visit here periodtoken let me just say that service was great and the venue was awesome periodtoken my issue was the food periodtoken i didnt expect full on authentic latin food periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni expected authentic tasting modern latin dishes and taste just isnt there periodtoken i ordered empanadas and that is where i stopped periodtoken i would still go back for the bar and food but not for latin food periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8753":"food was tasty but i was very disappointed that yelp had them on the list of gluten free pancakes and they do not have gluten free pancakes periodtoken if i would have stood in the long line that is usually here i would have been pissed periodtoken yelp needs to change their information so those with celiac who are craving pancakes wont be crying in their eggs like i am now periodtoken","8754":"decent bbq chicken panini that had bacon for free but lettuce tomatoes and onions cost extra seems a bit odd periodtoken note a 7 minimum for a credit card and with a vitamin water my total was just north of 10 periodtoken","8756":"ive always had such mixed feelings about bu periodtoken  i so wanted to like bu commatoken to support a local chain commatoken to enjoy the quirky environs commatoken and the moderately inventive offerings commatoken but i think im finally done periodtoken  last night was probably the last visit to bu well make for a while periodtoken  my boyz and i all left a little queasy after the greasy fried mushrooms and onion rings periodtoken  we were hungry they tasted good while they were hot commatoken but we all acknowledged while we were eating them they were overly greasy and oily periodtoken  bu has never really gotten the fried part right and last night was the final straw for us periodtoken  the fried food seems to always be soaked in oil periodtoken  last night commatoken it was overwhelming and just too heavy for us all periodtoken  were not wilting lillys when it comes to meat and fat commatoken but even for us commatoken it was a bit much and the the oil smelled a bit old periodtoken  service is always spotty commatoken which tells me there isnt consistent training and it was spotty last night periodtoken  i ordered a turkey patty with my wedge and was given a full blown turkey sandwich not even sure i was charged for it i was tired and didnt want to even pursue it periodtoken  whatever periodtoken  our server was nice and had a great attitude commatoken but he left us sitting for a long time and then the food runners didnt know who had ordered what periodtoken   message for bu wait staff  its pretty darned simple to take 5 seconds before you get to the table to figure out who ordered what periodtoken  ive waited tables before and have been helped by my fellow wait staff we got organized ahead of arriving at the table periodtoken  i also didnt force my customers to scramble to reorganize the table settings while i stood waiting laden down with hot food periodtoken  dont make your customers do that periodtoken  that move really gets up my nose periodtoken  you can prepare for thatyour customers want to relax dont stress them out trying to help you bc you were ill prepared to deliver the food periodtoken  so commatoken the good part the food isnt bad commatoken but its inconsistent periodtoken  last night commatoken my husband and boys had great burgers on gluten free buns periodtoken  they were perfectly cooked midrare periodtoken the buns were tasty and not dry at all periodtoken    but commatoken that wont be enough to bring us back periodtoken  we need a break from bu to let us forget the mixed results commatoken the queasy feeling in our stomachs from too much grease commatoken and the sense that im overpaying for amateurish staff periodtoken  bus homemade ketchup is very tasty periodtoken  so is the dipping sauce for the fries as well as the mustard aioli commatoken which i use on my salad  its like honey mustard periodtoken  the fries are always soggy and are served in a stainless steel cup commatoken which just makes them even more soggy periodtoken   sigh periodtoken  goodbye for a while commatoken bu periodtoken","8758":"this is a typical giant periodtoken my favorite part is that there is a giant gas outside commatoken so i can use my reward points to get gas after i finish my grocery shopping periodtoken the only annoying part of the giant is that their produce is not always fresh commatoken so sometimes i make a trip to another store to purchase produce periodtoken","8768":"id like to start by saying it wasnt bad by any means commatoken but there is certainly much better mexican food in area periodtoken i gave two thumbs up for their homemade chips commatoken as they were delicious  the salsa was pretty good too periodtoken i had the vegetarian enchiladas periodtoken it seemed like it was just a tortilla wrapped with sparse veggies periodtoken the enchilada sauce just ehh periodtoken i wouldnt say i would never go back again commatoken because id be up to trying something else on their menu periodtoken for right now commatoken i just give it 3 stars periodtoken","8771":"its hard to find a good doner kebab periodtoken  dooners has great fresh ingredients and equipment to make the proper doner periodtoken  they a variety of menu options to that to make things interesting periodtoken  the use of naan bread in different combinations with kebab meat is an interesting spin from the usual doner kebab joint periodtoken  the owner is afghan and lived in germany where he picked up the diner kebab art periodtoken  have had a couple of issues with employees who are either new or untrained periodtoken  they were not familiar with what portion size commatoken proper use of equipment i periodtokene periodtoken how to pour a beer or the menu periodtoken  in one case i ordered a hummus salad and got no hummus periodtoken  the employees are always friendly periodtoken  a big negative is that they do not shave the portion of meat directly from the spit commatoken as is traditionally done periodtoken  instead they shave it and put it on a heater in the food prep area periodtoken this leaves the meat less flavorful periodtoken  an employee told me that it was a health department regulation commatoken but it makes no sense of why that would be any more sanitary periodtoken the same shaver is being used in any case periodtoken     in general commatoken i feel that the portion size is small compared to other doner shops and the price is on the high side periodtoken   downtown st periodtoken petersburg needs another doner shop to get some healthy competition going periodtoken","8772":"good mexican food at a fair price periodtoken wait staff could be a little more friendly periodtoken looks like they are almost finished remodeling the restaurant commatoken which looks very nice periodtoken","8773":"very slow commatoken and they leave items behind the counter so you dont know if your order is ready periodtoken i had waited 15 minutes for a large soup that was done prior to me coming up to the counter periodtoken they kept putting items up on the counter but the soup was not one of them periodtoken normally they announce the numbers each time they put items up on the counter periodtoken","8776":"ive been here a couple of times with some of my friends who live in the area periodtoken  boy is this place popular on a saturday night periodtoken  a great vibe and place to try many different craft beers if that is what you are into periodtoken  they do have a limited wine menu commatoken but no liquor if that is more to your liking periodtoken  parking is a bit of a pain so be prepared to either get there early commatoken walk commatoken risk having to park far away commatoken or get towed","8777":"whoa its loud in there periodtoken went for a business lunch and we could barely hear each other periodtoken food is good periodtoken gluten feee crust is good periodtoken its a cute place and i will probably be back due to the location of my office periodtoken","8779":"this place wasnt bad but compared to doma vics or other sushi places its not that great periodtoken the best thing we had was the soft shell crab appetizer which had a really good lobster sauce periodtoken sushi and fish were decent","8780":"out of all the steakhouses in the area i must say this one isnt the best but it will do for someone who loves steak and on a tight budget periodtoken the steak are hearty and cook to ur preference periodtoken the portions are big enough to satisfy your hunger and enough to take home to enjoy later periodtoken","8783":"there are an even amount of pros and cons to luigis periodtoken   pros  service is quick commatoken staff is friendly commatoken the menu has good variety commatoken sandwiches are decent commatoken good with custom orders periodtoken  cons  food is inconsistent periodtoken one week wed have a great pie commatoken the next week it was undercooked periodtoken  fries are always soggy for some reason periodtoken  tables are rarely cleaned in the restaurant itself periodtoken  you need to clean them yourself periodtoken    its good in a pinch but not somewhere id drive longer than 10 minutes to go to periodtoken","8784":"took my wife here for our anniversary based on so many 5 star reviews periodtoken i am guessing many of these are based on the owner and staff commatoken who are really quite lovely people periodtoken   but a review is about food commatoken and i was not overly impressed periodtoken no fresh spring rolls on the menu  commatoken fried tofu was overdone commatoken the fried egg rolls were okay if a little over cooked as well periodtoken not off to a great start periodtoken   there are no small portions of tom yum or tom ka soups both start at 9 periodtoken95 periodtoken  my papaya salad was not the freshest commatoken but did have a nice fermented quality periodtoken   our entrees were chicken pad thai and chicken drunken noodles periodtoken very standard fare periodtoken based on prior thai food consumption we both got mild to avoid scorching our mouth out periodtoken and they were extra mild and honestly commatoken really bland periodtoken   the pad thai was served without peanuts commatoken and was lacking in the typical sweet and sour zing periodtoken drunken noodles were better commatoken but the sauce was lacking depth and dimension periodtoken   we want to love this place commatoken but with so many other dining options to chose from commatoken i doubt well be back anytime soon periodtoken","8786":"this place was super cute inside and it didnt take too long to get my ice cream made periodtoken i got my ice cream with coconut and strawberry mixed in periodtoken i couldnt see the strawberry at all periodtoken i had probably 1 or 2 bites where i could actually taste the strawberry periodtoken there was waaaaaaay too much coconut as well periodtoken it was basically like eating spoonfuls of shaved coconut periodtoken way more coconut than ice cream for sure periodtoken i got a nutella drizzle which was just one circle around the cup periodtoken definitely only like 2 bites worth periodtoken the marshmallows on top were suuuper good periodtoken they toast them before adding them to the ice cream periodtoken i try not to give bad star ratings commatoken but i was just really disappointed with the ice cream periodtoken for over 6 i would not be back","8787":"three stars because ive had bad experiences in the past with them periodtoken any time i ordered the food almost never was all in my bag when id leave commatoken and one employee was very very very rude at the window when i told her the beans she gave me was literally all sauce and not one bean was in the cup periodtoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken seems they have been improving which is why ill give 3 stars and not 1 ","8789":"ive spent the past three years poking my head into bakeries around town commatoken hoping to find someplace that makes german rye bread with caraway seeds periodtoken ive often been told they dont make it commatoken or that its sold out commatoken or that its on the baking schedule for one weekend a month periodtoken i had almost given up when i decided to check out breadland periodtoken i was at the registry commatoken anyway commatoken so why not  i didnt even look at everything they offered periodtoken i immediately asked the salesperson if their rye contained caraway commatoken and she answered in the affirmative periodtoken i purchased a 5 loaf commatoken squeeing all the while about having finally found real rye bread in edmonton periodtoken im pretty sure the woman thought i was crazy periodtoken and the best news is that they make it every day periodtoken  as soon as i got out the door commatoken i had to gnaw off a piece to make sure it was true periodtoken it was once my excitement had passed and i was able to evaluate the bread in an objective fashion commatoken i decided it needed more caraway seeds periodtoken otherwise commatoken it was pretty damn good periodtoken upon arriving home commatoken hubs was really excited commatoken too periodtoken we consumed the entire loaf in one evening periodtoken","8790":"this is my 4th time touring the brewery and had to bring the boyfriend while here on vacation periodtoken the tour was interesting as usual commatoken very cool to see the different stages of the brewing process and our tour guides emma and mackenzie were helpful and funny commatoken very entertaining periodtoken we did see the clydesdales but only from afar commatoken last few trips we were able to get up close while in the stable periodtoken you do get free samples with the tour commatoken which is also free so you cant complain commatoken but i do remember you used to get several glasses at the end commatoken not just one periodtoken you also get a small plastic cup about 12 way through the tour periodtoken overall a mustsee for the newbies in town commatoken great experience not to be missed","8791":"the food here is pretty good periodtoken nothing too special and the service is hit and miss periodtoken the frozen custard is great periodtoken the fries are great periodtoken","8797":"i ordered their for the first time the food was good the only thing the mac and cheese taste like the edges from the pan a burnt taste and the smoothered pork chops was good just to much fat but everything else was very flavorful i would give them another try","8802":"i ate here with brunch on the last morning in town before heading back home periodtoken this is a pretty popular spot for brunch commatoken and given the small space commatoken youll likely have to wait a little bit of time before getting seated periodtoken there was about a 1520 minute wait before our group of 5 got seated commatoken which commatoken considering the tiny space commatoken was not all that bad periodtoken it has a bit less charm than other spots in the french quarter commatoken and it does feel a little bit divey periodtoken our waiter was alright commatoken but he didnt understand my question about orange juice commatoken and somehow my hashbrowns were forgotten entirely when my big easy breakfast was brought out everyone else ordered the same dish commatoken and it included them periodtoken  speaking of our food commatoken the big easy breakfast is pretty much what youd expect a standard breakfast to be  pancakes commatoken eggs commatoken breakfast meats commatoken home fries commatoken and toast periodtoken its relatively cheap commatoken but the food is quite average periodtoken the pancakes were a bit overcooked commatoken with the outside being a bit overcrisped and dark periodtoken the eggs were overeasy  hard to do wrong  and the home fries were a tad buttery but pretty solid periodtoken toast  quite bland periodtoken the sausage was decently flavored commatoken but the bacon was a tad undercooked periodtoken  its possible that the more regional brunch dishes are betterprepped and more representative of the local cuisine commatoken but the food was pretty average overall periodtoken i would come back if there wasnt a line and wanted some standardissue brunch cuisine commatoken but i dont think i would wait in line again if i had the choice periodtoken","8807":"i was expecting to be wowed but just wasnt periodtoken i ordered the chicken tenders with macncheese and cornbread periodtoken the chicken and macncheese were okay periodtoken  cornbread was very good periodtoken my husband ordered a burger periodtoken the char on his burger made it taste like charcoal periodtoken sauce on it was very good though periodtoken  the service was excellent periodtoken people were extremely friendly periodtoken plenty of seating and a relaxed atmosphere periodtoken","8808":"i did try to go here twice when i was in philly however commatoken i must stay the food was buffet and it didnt look too appealing at all periodtoken and i believe they had one seitan dish each time periodtoken needless to say commatoken i stopped in twice and the food didnt look appealing at all commatoken so i never tried it commatoken i just wanted to share my opinion periodtoken however commatoken i will say they had a very nice coop connected to it with excellent choices","8809":"3 periodtoken5  i really like this store commatoken if you can get past the fact that almost everyone in here is uber earthy crunchy commatoken probably wears soy underwear and bought a prius before gas prices started to climb because it was a smart thing to do commatoken not a trendy thing to do periodtoken  i just cant get over the prices commatoken though periodtoken  a friend of mine was kind enough to send me a 100 gift certificate commatoken so off i go commatoken gleefully ready to splurge on something that i wouldnt have normally spent  on periodtoken  but my cheap radar went bonkers commatoken and after almost an hour in the store oohing and aahing over the variety of items here commatoken i walked away with only a handful of items from the meats and cheese department commatoken a bottle of olive oil commatoken and i think a dr periodtoken bronners bottle commatoken and my bill came to 97 periodtoken77 periodtoken  owwww periodtoken  afterwards commatoken i had asked some friends to meet me here for lunch at the food bar commatoken thinking id have plenty of  left on the gift card to treat them periodtoken  for 3 of us sharing plates commatoken it was 43 with drinks periodtoken  owwww periodtoken","8810":"dont go after 7pm the staff cant keep up with the customer traffic periodtoken theyre always short staffed periodtoken","8813":"we went there last weekend periodtoken basically we wanted to try something new so we just searched the area for high rated places and this place was one of them periodtoken when we went there commatoken for a friday commatoken it was pretty quite periodtoken im not sure how a high rated place can be quite on a friday but i have to assume they may get most of the customers for lunch periodtoken the guy who greeted us and took our order was nice and polite and asked us have we ever been there periodtoken he explained everything and we picked pulled pork periodtoken the meat was ok commatoken however there was nothing special about it periodtoken the sides were cold and probably left over from lunch and to be honest not a very satisfying experience periodtoken the atmosphere was ok periodtoken signs were hand written on paper commatoken attached to the wall i liked the sitting area and the windows periodtoken","8819":"a decent bagel for florida commatoken cannot complain great coffee too","8822":"so i decided that i would visit this new establishment on its opening day periodtoken being from the area i knew that this business is in a building that once housed a kfc so i expected to see remnants from the prior occupant periodtoken although there were a couple things inside that looked similar much had changed periodtoken i grabbed a printed menu to step back out of the way and give a go through periodtoken decent sized menu that is mainly sticks to chicken but also has a small offering of wraps commatoken burritos commatoken and tacos periodtoken i ordered three different types of chicken off the menu periodtoken the first choice was fried chicken which was juicy commatoken had a almost homemade taste to it which i like periodtoken the breading is of the  seafood batter variety periodtoken chicken strips were my second chicken item periodtoken breading seemed to be the same but darker in color periodtoken chicken was again very juicy periodtoken one downfall is the side of one chicken strip had some bones still attached periodtoken my third menu item were the buffalo wings periodtoken large commatoken spicy commatoken and cooked properly periodtoken all in all i enjoyed the food and would give it a four commatoken the service was a bit so and a few mistakes were made but its the first day so its too be expected and id give that a two im sure theyll get the kinks worked out periodtoken if i was asked if id visit this place again i would say yes periodtoken","8823":"so my fianc\u00e9 and i decided to stop at golden diner for breakfast today commatoken i pass it everyday on my way to work in jersey and saw that its been making some new renovations and its still under construction but it seemed presentable enough to provide a decent breakfast periodtoken we park up commatoken with plenty of parking space and go to the entrance that seemed to be only temporary due to renovations periodtoken we approached the cashier desk as we were waiting to be seated and it didnt take long for the host to recognize some new customers and seat us periodtoken the host was very friendly and amiable periodtoken she sat us and took our drink orders periodtoken we ordered just water to start periodtoken that was our mistake periodtoken we didnt realize they serve tap water periodtoken not filtered tap water but straight tap water periodtoken i dont want to seem crazy for making this a bigger deal than it is commatoken but i dont drink tap water anywhere just because of water contamination and how bad its become all over the country periodtoken so bottle water or filtered water is all we and our families drink periodtoken that would have to be the only downfall about this place periodtoken that and maybe just making their waitresses seem more welcoming to guests and not just a potential tip periodtoken the food was great though periodtoken i ordered the 1 breakfast special and it filled me up perfectly periodtoken decent price and good food commatoken just dont order the water until they start serving filtered water or youre  comfortable with exposing yourself to potentially dangerous bacteria periodtoken","8824":"cute little cafe periodtoken food is average healthy periodtoken id like to see more rawvegan meals on the menu commatoken preferably salads and such no kale periodtoken the juices are a bit too sweet and sadly commatoken they dont juice the greens they blend them into the juice commatoken so theyre not pure juices commatoken but rather half pure commatoken half blended periodtoken they do have some good products on the shelves commatoken but again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken lets bring some good rawvegan treats in   im not a fan of processed healthy foods such as tofutempeh commatoken so i cant rave that those excite me periodtoken add salads","8826":"this place certainly knows its clientele periodtoken  the upscale minimalist amosthipster vibe perfectly suits the penn community periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken i think these attempts seem a little franchised commatoken and can only charge so much per meal because of the proximity to the penn undergrad living highrises periodtoken  i recently gave this place a second chance and tried the udon noodle salad apparently their most popular salad periodtoken  meh periodtoken  though i love their philosophy commatoken commitment to composting commatoken and the purely vegetarian menu commatoken the portions are too small and expensive periodtoken  the salad was good but not thrilling or filling periodtoken  though the portion sizes really require a side commatoken side salads or fries cost 44 periodtoken50 half the cost of most meals periodtoken  also commatoken when you get water with your meal you have to pour it from a prefilled pitcher without ice periodtoken  hmmmmm periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  good try commatoken hipcityveg  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken just keep tryin periodtoken","8827":"i like this place commatoken the last two times i have been in philadelphia i have dined at this facility periodtoken here are the things i disliked  lighting in this place is very subpar commatoken you need to bring a flash light just to see the menu  the booth seating is okay commatoken felt very cramped commatoken especially with 4 people in a booth  because space is limited on this cramped booth commatoken adding large plates and dishes does not help the cause periodtoken there is a hidden guarantee before you enter the premises that you will either wear what you are eating commatoken or at least manage to spill your food  these are the foods i would not order again  paneer pakoras really dry and felt they were heated in the microwave commatoken they had no flavor on their own periodtoken needed to dunk them in a sauce just to eat more than one piece  stay away from the ghajer ka halwa carrot dessert commatoken sorry i cant explain it any better i must have had the leftovers from the weekend because it actually tasted like the carrots were starting to rot and they still decided to use them commatoken just plain awful periodtoken  i would order these dishes again  malai kofta commatoken very delicious dish commatoken however they are a little stingy on kofta ball to sauce ratio periodtoken  chicken biryani  ras malai probably the best i had in any indian restaurant  the waiter is friendly since there is only one guy working every time i have been there periodtoken","8828":"endless chips were delicious especially when paired with dips periodtoken my server was a nice guy considering it was a busy friday night periodtoken restrooms were dirty and the back of my seat booth was wobbly so anytime i leaned back i disturbed my neighbor commatoken and vice versa periodtoken went for happy hour great deal and ordered many apps and house margaritas commatoken everything was yummy but felt sick afterwards periodtoken i would go back if i ran out of alternatives","8835":"once a staple for me commatoken is now fading commatoken sadly periodtoken  i can not deny the brew periodtoken still as tasty as it has always been commatoken in my opinion periodtoken but the sad thing is commatoken the food quality is a ghost of its former self periodtoken i understand corners need to be cut when a place just isnt generating the revenue it once did periodtoken and lets be honest commatoken to be a owner of a pub in broad ripple cant be easy commatoken especially nowadays periodtoken hell commatoken theres a new barrestaurant opening up every month it seems like periodtoken but commatoken sometimes when this happens commatoken places like the brewpub lose periodtoken it just saddens me to see what the food has become in the last 5 years periodtoken  ex periodtoken 1 periodtoken prefab scotch eggs frozen the fried periodtoken         2 periodtoken beer cheese crock that is thinner than the beer you drink along side it periodtoken  i actually let it set for a half hour to see if it would solidify commatoken but nope periodtoken still like liquid periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensomething tells me i shouldnt be eating a cheese like that  periodtoken        3 periodtoken fish and chips periodtoken nothing to say here except if you remember what they were like 5 plus years ago commatoken youre sadly disappointed periodtoken all dough and no show periodtoken       i could go on commatoken but ill stop there periodtoken  the upside is that its the brewpub commatoken and you should just check it out periodtoken seriously periodtoken especially if youre a pub lover periodtoken this pub looks like you just walked into the uk periodtoken very very much the real deal in terms of decor commatoken etc periodtoken  also commatoken i just point out that they really do have some kick a periodtokens weekly specials periodtoken","8836":"i like the cinnamon sugar and plain cream cheese periodtoken service was okay but a little slow periodtoken","8837":"cool russian inspired food and unique beers brewed in house periodtoken just found out they offer brewery tours now which ill be looking into periodtoken  staff is chill and an interesting group of downtoearth guys who started this establishment from ground up periodtoken living a few doors down commatoken i know ill be back soon and recommend giving something new and different to try commatoken even if youre not local periodtoken especially considering the places trendy commatoken relaxed commatoken one of a kind atmosphere commatoken and the areas abundance of options periodtoken","8839":"this place is located at a strip mall with parking which is a plus commatoken its a convenience store in the front and a deli with seating inside and out in the back periodtoken i came in with my mother and ordered a bacon egg and cheese commatoken hot ham and cheese sandwich commatoken and a butter roll periodtoken the lady commatoken older commatoken is very nice and tried to help us the best she could but she really didnt understand the pos and it took her a while to put the order up for the kitchen periodtoken once the order was up commatoken i reminded the lady at the register that i wanted salt pepper and ketchup on the bacon egg and cheese only way to eat it right btw and she went to tell one of the cooks who was apparently new periodtoken she told the lady that it wasnt possible even though the sandwich wasnt even assembled periodtoken the guy who seemed to be one of the owners or close to commatoken took over the orders periodtoken the food was pretty good commatoken no complaints there commatoken but way overpriced periodtoken im from new york and and work at a deli and i guess im used to really fast service but to make 3 sandwiches as simple as they were should have taken as long as they did and cost more than it does in new york commatoken which if you dont know commatoken has really high priced food periodtoken if you are in a hurry commatoken i highly recommend calling ahead commatoken if not commatoken this isnt the place for you to go periodtoken otherwise commatoken no complaints periodtoken they should really try to write down order for the kitchen for more efficient service and as the order is being carried out commatoken ring the person up periodtoken if not commatoken simplify the pos for the poor lady periodtoken","8841":"i got to try a new donut well commatoken a donut that was new to me periodtoken it was a yeast donut with a cream filling commatoken peanut butter glaze and chocolate sprinkles periodtoken the cream tasted just like the pudding you can buy premade at the grocery  to me commatoken it has this underlying flavor of plastic periodtoken so commatoken i wasnt crazy about that periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut the peanut butter glaze was the perfect flavor to help cover that up","8842":"typical 15 burger joint periodtoken went on a sunday afternoon they were pretty busy but luckily we were able to be seated immediately periodtoken odd half booth  half table seating with semiuncomfortable wood seats and backrests to match the wood tables periodtoken they do have odd long pillows you can sort of use for added backrestcomfort periodtoken lots of kidsfamilies our server was great and all the other servers who helped her out periodtoken everyone was very pleasant periodtoken i had the mushroom commatoken onion  swiss burger with sweet potato fries and a side of regular fries periodtoken the burger was decent periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit could have been cooked less and it would have been much better periodtoken sweet potato fries were good commatoken i just wish they didnt presalt them  a little salty for me periodtoken the regular fries were also just ok commatoken honestly they didnt taste super fresh periodtoken i cant say i would never go back here and try something new commatoken but just keep in mind you can get similar burgers at half the price at competing restaurants periodtoken  the ambiance was 5050 periodtoken the overall decor was nice periodtoken loud commatoken but it was fullpacked with customers periodtoken the seatingcushions were filthy with food remnants periodtoken  if i do go back id like to try something new and request the burger to be cooked at a different temp periodtoken","8849":"i ate at bareburger for my first time last week the burger was good commatoken but i did have an issue with the prices periodtoken i had the standard burger commatoken and after asking the waitress if the french fries were really worth getting and being assured they were great commatoken i ordered a side of ff periodtoken  that was a mistake  they were old commatoken limp commatoken and cost 2 periodtoken85 for a handful periodtoken  i love ff commatoken and i didnt even eat half of them commatoken even at that price periodtoken  i dont mind 6 oz burgers not everyone wants a halfpound of meat periodtoken  but the prices commatoken especially for just the standard beef burger commatoken were ridiculous given that they are regularsized burgers periodtoken the meat burger combinations run anywhere from 10  13 commatoken and thats with no real side periodtoken  everything commatoken even an additional different sauces commatoken is a la carte periodtoken so youre best off not trying to put your own combination together periodtoken i didnt bother ordering anything to drink because i knew just the basic burger and the side of limp fries were already going to be running me at least 18 with tax and tip commatoken so i too got the small glass of lukewarm water like another reviewer mentioned periodtoken i couldnt help but sit there and think fondly of bobbis burgers in university city periodtoken i realize that theyre not stocking all the unusual meats commatoken but if youre looking for a beef or chicken or turkey burger commatoken the prices and certainly the french fries are are definitely better commatoken and the combos are somehow easier to follow commatoken inspired commatoken and tempting periodtoken a carousel of 4 different sauces sit on the counters and tables commatoken to be used on burgers or fries commatoken as you wish commatoken  and for free periodtoken maybe thats why i felt especially annoyed at bareburger i felt the concept was good commatoken the ingredients were good commatoken but i was being nickled and dimed to death commatoken and the execution wasnt great periodtoken too bad that bareburger is only 4 blocks from where i live i really wanted to like it more periodtoken","8850":"dont get your hopes up on a slice of specialty pizza commatoken even though its on their menu commatoken they cant make it and will offer you to purchase all the toppings on a cheese slice of pizza periodtoken   so commatoken we ordered a cheese slice and its been 20 mins and it has not come out yet periodtoken  and still waiting periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   waitress is not attentive to the table and cares more about gossiping with co workers and twirling her hair periodtoken overheard her complaining about a tip she received from a customer periodtoken   as we finally received our food i have changed my 2 start review to a 3 star based on the food quality periodtoken  food over all is pretty tasty periodtoken i wouldnt recommend the cheese slice but the stromboli was delicious periodtoken","8851":"dont know if there has been a change over in staff recently commatoken but service has gotten much better on my more recent trips periodtoken that said commatoken ive been too fearful to go during their normal lunch hours commatoken but around 10am and 2pm the service is much better periodtoken","8853":"my favorite taco bell periodtoken food quality is ok periodtoken amount of meat in the tacos is light periodtoken fast service periodtoken the counter clerk asked for a charitable donation periodtoken i dont really mind this too much periodtoken but dont act like im not charitable when i say no periodtoken i give lots to charities of my choosing periodtoken i dont know what tbs is commatoken but i vet all charities before i give my money away periodtoken smiles would help a lot too periodtoken friendly service gets customers back periodtoken understand you dont make much but i didnt either when i was young commatoken but i smiled and chatted with the customers periodtoken","8856":"i ate at tired hands fermentaria for the 3rd time commatoken so i feel like i can finally review the restaurant periodtoken let me say that if this was a brewery review commatoken it would be a 5 periodtoken  if you are looking to have some good beers and a snack commatoken this is the spot periodtoken for a full blown dining experience commatoken you can do better periodtoken  my waiter steven according to receipt said about 5 words to me the whole time i was there periodtoken  none of those words were your welcome or thank you periodtoken  he could have been having an off night so i wont harp on it commatoken but as someone who travels 100 nightsyear for work and eats out all of those nights commatoken i feel i know horrendous service when i see it periodtoken  the beer here is phenomenal  the hummus and tacos were pretty darn good as well periodtoken  i think next time im in town ill try harder to sit at the bar and just have beers and apps periodtoken","8859":"park on the pier for free if you can find parking if not just do valet and tip the guy periodtoken the wait here on a saturday late afternoon wasnt too bad for 2 periodtoken we just want something to snack on before dinner periodtoken we got the crab for 22 periodtoken was disappointed because they crab was so small the slaw that was given tasted so bland and even have crab shells in there probably from the guy chopping up the crab in the back periodtoken we tried the clam chowder and it wasnt anything spectacular periodtoken will not be coming back periodtoken","8860":"cousins isnt the greatest supermarket if you want the freshest produce commatoken but the quality of meats and seafood arent that bad periodtoken the prices are pretty cheap periodtoken they constantly have sales periodtoken also commatoken if you want spanish products commatoken this is the place to shop they have a very large selection of spanish products periodtoken once again commatoken not the greatest market commatoken but its still good periodtoken","8861":"maynards has a great look and it is right next to the train station periodtoken there is a deli side and a restaurant side periodtoken service was attentive periodtoken  wine list well appointed periodtoken  we wanted to like it better periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken here is the downside periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe particular meal we had was only ok periodtoken    we did start with the frites french fries which were tasty and yeah commatoken truly low brow periodtoken  buy hey commatoken we were in the mood periodtoken    the pork schnitzel was only ok periodtoken some of the parts were cool periodtoken  flavors did not pop periodtoken my halibut was on a bed of white beans and then something sweet roasted grapes for one thing which just made for a fussy dish periodtoken  i love halibut commatoken but not sweet periodtoken  and the beans tended to wash flavors out periodtoken not a fan of that dish periodtoken     we may have ordered badly periodtoken    small nit on service commatoken they took our orders wrong but that was quickly taken care of periodtoken  weird to see what came initially periodtoken   waiter apologetic commatoken and offered more glasses of wine commatoken but we had to pass as we were driving periodtoken tuscon has a lot of great places to eat and perhaps this was an off night periodtoken  but for us commatoken it didnt work commatoken and it was pretty expensive periodtoken  wont be back periodtoken","8863":"baileys reminded me of hop doddy because of their focus on burgers commatoken ice cream and shakes periodtoken baileyss had quite a selection of burgers with different toppings from your classic burger to fried mac and cheese and pbj periodtoken a lot of them sounded really great and i wanted to try multiple periodtoken   my brother and i got the davies chop house and wicked apple periodtoken we also ordered small fries with chipotle ketchup and fried pickles periodtoken the burgers were good commatoken but quite small for what you pay periodtoken  the fries and fried pickles were just okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i didnt really like the batter on the pickles periodtoken","8865":"food was pretty good periodtoken  i had the eggplant lasagna and curry veggies periodtoken  i thought it might have been a little pricey considering its not made to order and more like cafeteria style served periodtoken  i paid almost 9 for the two periodtoken  parking kinda bad commatoken but i will be going back periodtoken","8866":"i dont see what the big deal is commatoken it was good but not enough to come back periodtoken my ribs were fatty and served over generic tasteless bread periodtoken my husbands chicken was juicy and tender periodtoken its right off the pinellas trail so it might be nice to stop off for a quick bite on a walk or bike ride commatoken but i wouldnt make it a point to come back periodtoken","8867":"yeah commatoken i shouldnt eat pizza twice a day periodtoken well commatoken it was late commatoken i was hungry and it was the closest thing open periodtoken  the people were nice commatoken im not sure whether it was the sauce or the cheese but something was spicy periodtoken it was spicy in a good way periodtoken besides that commatoken standard crust commatoken standard cheese commatoken you know periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken a pizza periodtoken","8869":"decent food  i got the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend got the grilled cheese periodtoken grilled cheese was commatoken well commatoken cheesy a variety of cheeses blended very well together and pair nicely with a beer the pulled pork sandwich was smoky for sure periodtoken whatever sauce came with it was killer periodtoken i substituted brussel sprouts for the potato salad periodtoken both the sprouts and sandwich had a smokyburnt aftertaste that reminded me of a griddle that carried the flavors of all the other foods from the day commatoken not something im used to periodtoken  the beers are respectable periodtoken the menu offers a chance to find your match based on a chart on the back sweet vs periodtoken bitter commatoken light vs periodtoken dark periodtoken it helped me settle on the oatmeal stout  ive definitely had better commatoken but this was drinkable periodtoken the summer ale must be pretty popular they were out when my girlfriend requested it periodtoken our waitress recommended the k\u00f6lsch instead periodtoken nice and crisp commatoken perfect for summer periodtoken  a rather lively patio with musical stylings this marylander is unaccustomed to commatoken but could definitely get into periodtoken waitstaff is friendly and prices are fine commatoken though they seem to take a jump up on entrees periodtoken if youre nearby commatoken this place is good periodtoken  ps periodtoken dont forget to drop into the store to bring some of the beers home","8871":"upating with the name change to sweet taco periodtoken not feeling real good about this change periodtoken menu is now limited and so far unchanging periodtoken  one of the things we liked was seeing different things pop up periodtoken quality of has slipped a bit too periodtoken  had a favorite brisket taco and it was real dry periodtoken sauces and spices are not as tasty either periodtoken were going to hang in there for now periodtoken pulling for chris and charlie we want you guys to do well

   this is one of the worst experiences ive had periodtoken i placed an online order this morning to pick up my pizza at 115 pm commatoken so i could get in and get out for my lunch periodtoken  i get there and theres nothing marking the pick up area except a little text on some glass near the oven periodtoken i tell them im here for my order and they tell me it was lost in the system commatoken and they ask me what the pizza was periodtoken i tell them and they start to make it then tell me i can grab a drink periodtoken i tell the lady behind the counter i got a mexican fanta commatoken but

implied in the name and was prepared differently than the menu suggested commatoken and did not have enough fruit periodtoken the cinnamon bun pancake at first bite was delicious commatoken but the more you eat it the more you realize it is subpar periodtoken the filling was far too sticky and the pancake far too dense periodtoken it was also overpriced for the quality of the food commatoken roughly 30 dollars for both of us periodtoken 6 periodtoken510 experience overall periodtoken","8880":"this place is so close to home commatoken i think ill try walking there next time  theres nothing wrong with 3 stars periodtoken  its pretty darn good periodtoken  my favourite thing here is the dipping sauce for the curly fries periodtoken  the fries themselves are darn good too periodtoken    i

something that tastes great commatoken with only the basic choices and nothing fancy commatoken this would be your place","8889":"i usually go to pick up a gyro ive only eaten at a table in the restaurant twice periodtoken  the reason i pick up a gyro rather than eat in is because the service is ridiculously sllooowwww periodtoken  i would eat in when i have a couple of hours to sit around  maybe its greek tradition to sit around a few hours for a meal periodtoken  the food is pretty good there arent many greek restaurants in gloucester or camden countries commatoken and i would give four stars commatoken but i subtract a star for slow service periodtoken  even picking up commatoken i place my order and come back 30 minutes later  they need 30 minutes to put together a lamb gyro periodtoken","8890":"the food is pretty expensive and the bagels are average periodtoken  my everything lacked that aromatic commatoken crispy shell but it was soft and flavorful with plenty of cream

from crapplebees commatoken but still solidly chainfamily food periodtoken  i went with a strawberry lemonade commatoken chicken tortilla soup commatoken and had the pepper whitefish with ginger rice periodtoken  the rice was a little gross huge chunks of ginger in it that were not exactly tasty commatoken but the fish was fine and the server was very good as well periodtoken  four people ate here for about 60 commatoken which is what you expect of a family restaurant chain periodtoken","8911":"my first visit to this brewery restaurant and im close to being a fan periodtoken we were here to celebrate a friends birthday and it seemed like all 12 or so of us were satisfied with our food and experience periodtoken   it is a large and open space commatoken both dining room and bar area commatoken with some outside seating available as well periodtoken if i were to revisit a good chance i will id probably opt for bar area commatoken especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room periodtoken trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch commatoken the day of the event our 530 was changed to 500 by the restaurant periodtoken this was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7 periodtoken we were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party periodtoken   i first perused the beer offerings commatoken there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans periodtoken i selected their blueberry hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night commatoken even though little to no berry taste came through periodtoken i would probably try something else next time periodtoken the food menu was possibly too large in my opinion with sandwich commatoken pizza commatoken apps and entrees offered periodtoken i was very hungry and 75 of the menu appealed to me commatoken so i went to our excellent server frank for his advice periodtoken he suggested a few dishes and i thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree periodtoken it proved to be good advice commatoken a nicely cooked frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes periodtoken the fowl was tender and juicy still commatoken the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed commatoken it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened periodtoken the mashed were ok commatoken and probably the weakest link in the dish periodtoken i had an add on caesar salad that was fair and overpriced as add ons go at 6 periodtoken trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special commatoken she loved it and i have to admit commatoken they are sourcing quality crustaceans periodtoken  most others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things periodtoken surprisingly no one else tried any beer periodtoken we brought our own bday cake and were not charged a plating fee periodtoken beer aficionados should consider joining their reward program commatoken for a 15 one time fee you are entitled to a special glass that holds 22 oz for the price of a pint commatoken along with other perks and incentives periodtoken great place for gatherings commatoken lets go with 3 periodtoken75 ongoing research yelps","8913":"pros the long line moved very quickly  my husband liked his sweet potato pancakes  my bacon commatoken although expensive commatoken was tasty  cons the service wasnt very friendly commatoken and she did everything she could to

pancakes were just ok periodtoken after two i just lost my interest in eating them commatoken and it wasnt because i was full periodtoken they were underwhelming periodtoken i know buttermilk pancakes

the location is only a 5 minute walk from a 8 stop periodtoken   as with most boardgame caf\u00e9s commatoken ttc suffers from more emphasis on the boardgame and not enough on the caf\u00e9

not permitted periodtoken just like movie concession commatoken this is where they make their money   all in all commatoken a fun hangout place at great prices commatoken just eat before you go or

stand point commatoken id say it was a fivestar experience periodtoken the staff was super friendly and extremely patient with our rowdy group periodtoken the food on the other hand was aok periodtoken caytons menu lists over ten different gourmet burgers commatoken salads commatoken sandwiches and even adult shakes commatoken including one called the dude periodtoken that alone might we be worth an additional star periodtoken   menu items come with catchy names like home on the range a buffalo burger commatoken the belushi and the no substitutions  a quarter pound burger with three cheeses commatoken pancetta commatoken bacon and a bunch more periodtoken burgers are no more expensive than zin burger periodtoken i ordered the home on the range buffalo burger which was served with oaxaca cheese commatoken guacamole commatoken and cilantro mayo with a side of tater tots periodtoken i shouldve gone with the belushi periodtoken the patty was bright red and definitely appeared

in our group ordered the jabroni which was loaded with two patties commatoken pancetta commatoken capicola commatoken mozzarella and a few other items i cant recall periodtoken it was definitely a heavy choice  the hit of the night was definitely the dude shake periodtoken   since we were there at night we didnt get to catch the views of the golf course periodtoken the restaurant itself is certainly upscale periodtoken since i dont golf commatoken i dont imagine myself returning here for a meal anytime soon periodtoken it appeared as though the bathrooms also served as locker rooms for

periodtoken  the food took about 10 minutes and they have foil to put on top thank goodness commatoken the winds are gusting today periodtoken  i ventured home with food in hand periodtoken  upon the unfoiling commatoken we discovered their fiesta corn and no beans never mind the brown mexican rice which is on their online menu periodtoken  the cuban was ok the saucemustard was too sweet periodtoken  the tacos were ok commatoken but everything just tasted sweet to me commatoken even though officially commatoken only the short rib has the cha cha sauce periodtoken  obviously commatoken i had not read jen h periodtokens review and thought these were going to be closer to traditional limecilantro periodtoken  i will add that the fellow who took my order was nice commatoken though a

shop commatoken i used to love this place and would go there every time i was in town but ever since they started roasting their own beans things went down hill periodtoken its either the roast of

try to save  on not using the correct amount of beans periodtoken coffee tastes like watered down tea periodtoken drink the verve espresso commatoken or try the pour over periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken great pastries commatoken they did try to give me a free drink so im sure ill be back","8974":"i went there for lunch and it wasnt bad at all periodtoken i had the veggie burger combo with

fresh and i suggest to look out of the use before date before you buy periodtoken i have seen few products that are very close to use before date and the they are big that you cant finish it before that day periodtoken","8981":"just want to start by saying commatoken ive been waiting for this place to open forever periodtoken ive driven past it a million times even before this place came along

with that being said periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthats where my raving review stops upon entering commatoken i expected a hey welcome to our new fabulous restaurant from the hostess and instead got a party of four from one of the three random girls hanging around the door and fumbling with menus periodtoken i followed one into the room past the bar and upon entering commatoken she kind of stood to the side i made that face i guess because she said commatoken oh commatoken sit wherever youd like periodtoken she was very quiet and didnt seem hostess material our server came along and she seemed nice periodtoken i ordered the house margarita which was good and my husband got a corona periodtoken the menu was small which was fine as long as all 5 dinner entrees are exceptional but we

out of toilet paper periodtoken i mentioned it to our server upon returning to the table so that she could tell the hostess periodtoken an hour later commatoken my other daughter goes in and our server is in there filling up the toilet paper holders periodtoken in every place i have worked commatoken this is a hostess responsibility periodtoken not the person delivering your fooddrinks that

periodtoken","9019":"wings are incredible periodtoken burgers are descent periodtoken pizza is too greasy and cheesey periodtoken chicken caesar wrap is good sometimes periodtoken periodtokenfood is not consistent periodtoken ive heard comments about service issues commatoken however ive always had a good experience in that department periodtoken  place has a lot of potential periodtoken theres a huge commatoken super nice outside seating area with a bar  commatoken a bunch of tvs inside and a great craft beer selection periodtoken give it a shot periodtoken","9022":"it wasnt very good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni went just for the wings and they were nothing to write home about periodtoken i wont be going back for the wings but may try the pizza next time periodtoken","9023":"this review is going to be all over the place commatoken but deserved for the length of time waiting in line for pancakes periodtoken this place was recommended by pretty everyone we met before and after arriving in nashville commatoken so we gave it a whirl on a saturday morning periodtoken the line was out the door and around the corner alllll the way down 21st avenue periodtoken we heard the line went fast commatoken so we braved it periodtoken we made friends in line  a large family from indiana and a family from new orleans periodtoken we all concurred that we must be crazy for standing in a line this long for pancakes periodtoken we heard there was actually a system for determining how long youd be waiting in line periodtoken we were at the point on the street that was definitely going to be over an hour periodtoken husband brought us coffee from across the street periodtoken i had time to peruse a really cute gift shop a thousand faces where the line began and was able to purchase yet another dog print by marc tetro periodtoken a few people gave up waiting commatoken which i had mixed feelings about because commatoken if they waited even 20 minutes commatoken that was too long to wait to then give up but on the flip side commatoken it meant yay commatoken we moved a little closer to the front of the line good riddance commatoken impatient ones  as we neared the entrance commatoken i began to feel quite faint and wondered if i was even going to make it in to try one of twenty three flavors of pancakes periodtoken at the front of the line commatoken near the entrance commatoken there was a coffee station commatoken which we missed periodtoken two hours later commatoken we were called to our seats periodtoken the bus boy cleaned off our table and promised us the greatest breakfast of our lives periodtoken i had the caribbean pancakes periodtoken its hard to say if the meal was life changing because i felt physically ill by the time we sat down and ordered periodtoken my pancakes were good the syrup was especially delicious periodtoken were they life changing im afraid not periodtoken my beloved tupelo honey still holds the best pancakes in the world award and i dont think anyone has ever had to wait two hours for them periodtoken i cant recall what my husband ordered but he definitely had the cured ham which i tried and did not like periodtoken at all periodtoken we felt a little disappointed when we left commatoken but im not saying i wouldnt go back periodtoken but i would not wait in line that long again periodtoken i would not advise going when you are a little or a lot hungry periodtoken   catching up on portlandia episodes the next night commatoken we felt the brunch village episode was especially hilarious and fitting given the time we spent in line the day prior periodtoken while we didnt experience any tim robbins pirate types commatoken we did wonder why provence didnt have an ed begley jr periodtoken out on 21st shouting to pancake pantry patrons to come to their restaurant with little to no wait periodtoken","9024":"the service was terrific periodtoken the food was good commatoken just not amazing periodtoken we ordered french toast commatoken eggs commatoken hash browns commatoken and pancakes periodtoken the hash browns were an extra 3 or 4 for just a small amount periodtoken","9025":"this review is strictly for my market lunch experience  came here for lunch and ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend got the ceasar salad periodtoken i also order their chai because im a chai fanatic and order it whenever i get the chance periodtoken the food was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengood ingredients but for the price commatoken id expect something a little closer to ajs fine foods periodtoken the concept is setup similar to ajs where they serve pastries commatoken cafe drinks commatoken sandwiches commatoken etc periodtoken my chai commatoken while it was decent commatoken was only filled up maybe 13 of the way and the rest foam  i ordered a large btw and it felt very much like a small so for a 5 chai latte commatoken i definitely felt i got jipped periodtoken we sat outside in the patio and the train kept going by every 1015mins periodtoken it was very loud and awkward to have a conversation with my friend periodtoken my sandwich was simply okay periodtoken i only ate one half and didnt finish the other periodtoken the service was really good periodtoken the lady was very patient with me while i was ordering periodtoken    overall commatoken im going to stick to ajs periodtoken periodtoken periodtokencloser to home and much more satisfying periodtoken i will have to come for dinner and hopefully the food will be better periodtoken","9026":"my daughter had the beef and cheddar brisket and i got the ny brisket periodtoken the cheddar brisket taste just like a bbq sandwich nothing special about it and my ny brisket felt like ham w melted cheese sandwich periodtoken i gotta say though the bread is really soft periodtoken the services was good cant complain periodtoken would i go there again meh commatoken i mean i would choose them over subway but if im on a budget commatoken subway lol periodtoken","9027":"stopped by here on our way to the airport after reading yelp reviews periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken park in the back commatoken walk in and go to the back of the store to order your food periodtoken  we went with two orders of beef pho commatoken regular 12 inch bahn mi commatoken spring roll and vietnamese ice tea periodtoken    beef pho  you can definitely taste the msg in the broth periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken can be overwhelming periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so if you are not a fan of msg commatoken i would recommend you stay away from the dish periodtoken  spring roll  its not made fresh as it tasted like it was made the day before and left overnight periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and i can see this happening as they open early and closes at 8pm periodtoken   bahn mi  the best food amongst the food we ordered periodtoken  i dont know if pickled radish is standard in bahn mi commatoken but this place did not use radish in their bahn mi periodtoken  there is a seating area by the from of the store periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken once you are done eating commatoken go to the cashier and pay for your meal periodtoken","9028":"i was skeptical when someone at the dog park told me that italianos was better than pops periodtoken  i am new to philly and to water ice periodtoken  but after trying pops i saw no reason to go anywhere else periodtoken  then i had a moment of insanity and thought commatoken why not try to broaden my horizons  i had italianos vanilla water ice periodtoken  it was fine periodtoken  aok periodtoken  but a bit too sweet commatoken not subtle enough periodtoken  so five bites into it commatoken i headed over to pops periodtoken  life is too short to eat aok water ice when you can go to pops and have the best periodtoken","9033":"very good food it was cold thou i wish i can order more often but they usually not able to deliver food was very good thou just cold","9036":"food good periodtoken  wings were very good periodtoken fries okay periodtoken grilledburnt pita bread and hummus okay periodtoken atmosphere  not so great commatoken  sat at full service bar and i have no idea who my server was suppose to be as a bunch of people kept talking to us but no one knew that we had already ordered commatoken and our drinks sat empty unless we specifically asked for refills nonalcoholic periodtoken  chairs were the most uncomfortable metal cheap stools that ive sat on periodtoken probably wont be going back anytime soon periodtoken","9037":"hows the food here can anyone tell me i stood around in front of two of the cafe workers at the counter for three
