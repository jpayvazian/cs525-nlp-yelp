periodtoken we pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off periodtoken we thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in periodtoken so we proceeded to the door periodtoken there were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm commatoken so we walked inside periodtoken it was like walking into the twlight zone commatoken everyone stopped and stared at us periodtoken the woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed periodtoken huh ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so we left periodtoken it was very akward and unpleasant periodtoken if they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something periodtoken  not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again periodtoken","153":"this place was awful periodtoken the first time my mother and i went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business

commatoken no one even acknowledged that we were there periodtoken the bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me periodtoken my mom was so annoyed we just left periodtoken   the second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try periodtoken we were seated right away and the music was really good periodtoken the waiter could have cared less about our table periodtoken he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table periodtoken the menu was thin and nothing to really choose from periodtoken when he eventually brought the food it was decent periodtoken my mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season periodtoken it honestly looked like two pieces of bread periodtoken   it was overpriced for what we had periodtoken i would never recommend this place periodtoken the take out makes great dog food though periodtoken","166":"define the worst mediterranean food i have ever had periodtoken  the hummus appeared to have a good texture commatoken that is the little bit i could see under the ocean of olive oil periodtoken  the pita bread was burned not just over toasted commatoken but black on the majority of the wedges periodtoken  i went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it periodtoken   the manager was probably the worst of the experience periodtoken he told my gf he would upgrade her hummus for no charge commatoken because normally its 1 periodtoken00 but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor periodtoken  he then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation and says commatoken please let me know how your food is because thats the only way i can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me periodtoken  but we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil commatoken er i mean hummus periodtoken  there is also a sign that advertises the cleanest bathroom in town periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken ehhhh ok commatoken good to know for our next road trip periodtoken","174":"im a barbecue judge and this aint

like this place as the location is easy and convenient periodtoken the bar is great commatoken the staff friendly commatoken but there is not a dish i have tried that is passable although the asian shrimp wasnt bad commatoken but very sweet periodtoken first visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs periodtoken on our second visit i ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty periodtoken no one informed me that they were out of buns commatoken but they could have at least tried to dress it up periodtoken it was seriously a lone piece of ground meat to their

periodtoken  their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor periodtoken  i also tried the bbq chicken pizza and it was okay periodtoken    i certainly wouldnt steer anyone away from this place based on the food periodtoken  the food is basic and simple commatoken not bad but also nothing great periodtoken  my biggest qualm with the daily bread is the service periodtoken  the majority of the

in line periodtoken  we waited for a good 56 minutes to put an order in periodtoken  after receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available periodtoken  there were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind periodtoken  does anyone bus these tables  i anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves commatoken but it appeared as though the tables hadnt been effectively cleaned in a while periodtoken  there was also some trash on the floor that hadnt been addressed as well periodtoken  the order number was called and the order was only halfway completed periodtoken  when we asked which sandwich was ours commatoken we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders periodtoken   after another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat periodtoken  i tried both items and as i stated before commatoken both were okay periodtoken  the problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization commatoken the slow speed at which we were served commatoken or the cleanliness of the restaurant periodtoken  after 3 attempts commatoken im writing the daily bread off and wont return periodtoken  id rather go to st periodtoken louis bread co commatoken get the same level of food commatoken but in a clean environment and a timely setting periodtoken","197":"literally commatoken the worst taco bell i have ever been to periodtoken the restaurant is filthy

to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along periodtoken before he got back from doing his price check commatoken i already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1 periodtoken99 each periodtoken thats more like it periodtoken  at around that same moment commatoken the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager periodtoken he tells me that the price was commatoken in fact commatoken incorrect periodtoken and that the price is actually 14 periodtoken99 periodtoken  thats the unscrupulous part periodtoken  clearly commatoken that price is also far too high periodtoken his manager did no actual price check at all periodtoken he simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less commatoken thinking that id be stupid enough to accept this periodtoken why commatoken because im white commatoken and youre a racially superior indian you think white people are stupid dont you well just believe what you tell us commatoken and fork over our money periodtoken","284":"i went in when they had 4 people working commatoken waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically

at him not to touch anything periodtoken i get it commatoken no one wants sandy little hands in the candy periodtoken but he wasnt touching anything commatoken so this was just rude periodtoken we stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us commatoken no smile commatoken no greeting commatoken she didnt even look at us periodtoken perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting periodtoken she ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited commatoken more loud shouty laughter periodtoken im all about a great fun atmosphere and i know i sound like a bore periodtoken but when it comes handinhand with a rude attitude towards paying customers commatoken it crosses a line periodtoken","306":"the foods great commatoken but no buflight on tap periodtokeni love the servers there  commatoken especially jamie white commatoken whose the best server periodtoken but again periodtoken lack of bud light is a big negative","324":"store is severely understaffed waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  avoid this store if possible  the workers are nice commatoken but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategy","327":"i legit just walked into blaze being 9pm and as soon as i got to the line i was told that they are closed periodtoken im not sure if

45 minutes to get me my eggs commatoken and when they came they were cold periodtoken i informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and i asked him if they could make me new eggs periodtoken  he said yes commatoken and took my eggs periodtoken  he came back out with my same plate commatoken and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it the toast was soggy commatoken and fruit warm periodtoken i returned my food commatoken and have vowed to never return periodtoken","615":"omg you would think that the drinks would be strong so that you wouldnt notice how bad the food is but no such luck periodtoken capirihinias taste like dishwater periodtoken coconut shrimp were burned and the fried avocado was a gloppy mess periodtoken never periodtoken again periodtoken","626":"if i could give negative stars i would periodtoken terrible service periodtoken no one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and thats only because i was leaving periodtoken the other customers told me dont bother ordering because ive been waiting over 30 minutes periodtoken","629":"i would give this place 0 stars if i could periodtoken we went during sunday happy hour and i specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials periodtoken come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price periodtoken the waitress was not apologetic commatoken just annoyed when i confronted her and said i didnt know you wanted happy hour periodtoken i was confused because it is the first thing i asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table periodtoken  she also rarely came to our table to check on us periodtoken go elsewhere commatoken there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink periodtoken","631":"i wish i could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken on the way back from philly to our beach house recently commatoken my wife and i stopped in for a sandwich periodtoken  we were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress periodtoken  my wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some diced tomatoes in it periodtoken  the young waitress repeated the order back and said of course no problem periodtoken  i ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would i like it cooked which was odd commatoken but i added medium please periodtoken  i ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order periodtoken  a full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared periodtoken  my wifes order came with sliced tomatoes no biggie and she just ate it anyway commatoken  i attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the overmicrowaved wheat roll periodtoken my wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt periodtoken 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and i explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll periodtoken  this one was mostly frozen periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so i told her never mind ill just eat the patty and tomatolettuce periodtoken  the patty was cardboard but i ate it anyway periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustardketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room periodtoken odd commatoken since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside periodtoken  she was very timid about offering the explanation and i just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather i assumed an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere periodtoken  upon leaving commatoken i advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since you ate the burger part periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken with no apology or attempt at customer service periodtoken the waitress got her full tip periodtoken   i was so angry that i vowed to open a yelp account and did  avoid this place at all costs periodtoken","633":"very nice delivery driver periodtoken but very slow service periodtoken sandwich was less than satisfactory periodtoken they still owe me a 17 refund from a month ago periodtoken there were no napkins with my order periodtoken i am just teally disappointed periodtoken","640":"ive been eating here when im in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great periodtoken the food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish periodtoken i ate here for lunch today commatoken saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me commatoken i ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each others food periodtoken the mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark periodtoken the pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old periodtoken this was labeled in the menu as a 1010 spicy rating commatoken it was at most a 2 periodtoken i didnt bother saying anything because of how rude the waiterhost was commatoken but ill get to that periodtoken the rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved periodtoken the dumplings looked ok commatoken but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it periodtoken her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesnt care about their food periodtoken the noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it commatoken just disappointing really periodtoken this type of food is supposed to be robust and ive eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out periodtoken this place doesnt care anymore periodtoken the man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time periodtoken he huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when i asked for the real chinese menu instead of the americanized chinese menu periodtoken and commatoken they used to throw shade if you asked for the americanized menu commatoken now its the opposite periodtoken after we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and i decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house periodtoken they look cool and i like to feed them periodtoken anyway commatoken the take out container was dirty from previous food in it i was blown away commatoken especially when i pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed commatoken literally stormed off before i was even half way through my sentence periodtoken i was calm the whole time commatoken not sure what this guys deal is periodtoken then came back with the same container that he washed he washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable periodtoken i will never go here again and i hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this handy nasty food periodtoken disgusting food and disgusting people commatoken except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us periodtoken he seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and i assume throughout his life periodtoken i hate this place commatoken and i can only hate it because i used to love it periodtoken","642":"this place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive periodtoken im admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager ali commatoken who when i asked why my room wasnt made up despite my  calling housekeeping commatoken stopping by the front desk and activating the green make up room button  behaved as though making the bed commatoken cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job periodtoken in less time than i spent requesting the service commatoken i could have cleaned my own room periodtoken worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button periodtoken a lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on periodtoken     no one knows the hotel policies or amenities and i got a different answer every time i asked a question periodtoken   the binder in the room indicates that i can either use the inroom safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk periodtoken when i asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box commatoken they said they had no idea what i was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service periodtoken the front desk said theres no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho i was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box periodtoken no one has read their own guest binder periodtoken   the binder and literature also says there is a pool periodtoken there is not periodtoken there is not a even single place to sit or walk outside commatoken and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years periodtoken they could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air commatoken since there are no balconies or windows that open periodtoken   there was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third periodtoken had they been providing what they claim to commatoken theyd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green make up room light had been on for nine hours periodtoken i dont really care if my bed gets made commatoken but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door commatoken \u00e0 call and voicemail to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where i was assured the room was serviced commatoken thats just bad management periodtoken    post script i was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 930 and 1030 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room periodtoken i did not so much mind being awakened by their work commatoken as much as terrified when  after id dozed back off  they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for do not disturb periodtoken i called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where i left a voicemail periodtoken its like no one is in charge of this place periodtoken not hospitable periodtoken    the gym is decent and security commatoken bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely periodtoken","668":"gave them another try today  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken smdh  periodtoken periodtoken

cooking periodtoken its been some time since i have frequented this restaurant commatoken i stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent periodtoken  fast forward to today commatoken i decided to stop by since some years had passed periodtoken  i ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i just have to say that i was very disappointed periodtoken the oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken more fat than meat and small portions at that periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe rice was stale periodtoken  but what was really disappointing was the jerk wings periodtoken periodtoken i took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken periodtoken periodtoken  i just couldnt believe that an establishment would serve this periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they just cant periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food periodtoken  i was right to stay away for years commatoken and i will be doing so again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","706":"i would not bother spending money on the drinks here periodtoken they lack the necessary selection for a coffee house periodtoken even their signature drink is overly and needlessly sweet and lacks any real flavor periodtoken i cant speak for their food but from what i saw commatoken is overpriced periodtoken","707":"we have loved schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food periodtoken so commatoken when we had guests in town commatoken we decided to drive a bit and take them to bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place periodtoken what in the heck happened to this place saturday afternoon commatoken the patio was

periodtoken waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty periodtoken once seated commatoken some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad commatoken so that made the meal i already had prepared completely worthless periodtoken the topper was when we got our checks commatoken the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies periodtoken so is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more  i do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events commatoken but i was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way i did and actually driving more than a mile to go here periodtoken surely commatoken schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests periodtoken live and learn periodtoken","714":"will not return periodtoken have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service commatoken but have observed no positive changes periodtoken their drive thru service is terrible commatoken both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology periodtoken

get my food periodtoken their response is sorry commatoken we got backed up periodtoken it seems they are backed up on every occasion periodtoken they even have the sandwiches premade waiting to go in

periodtoken pastries had the croissant commatoken eclair commatoken cannoli are okay but nothing amazing periodtoken dining area is small periodtoken very limited drink options periodtoken i agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of breakroom coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buyinbulk tea bags periodtoken    really what soured the experience was the counter staff periodtoken  after my so and i purchased several pastries commatoken coffee commatoken tea and went to sit down commatoken the staff informed us that we couldnt stay because they were closing

away periodtoken after all this commatoken i had to remind her that i was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in periodtoken we came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time periodtoken  i would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign periodtoken would much rather enjoy a premade croissant and better drink options at the adjacent starbucks or pjs periodtoken lesson learned

approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy periodtoken i watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration periodtoken no staff member including the english speaking managersupervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all

half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries periodtoken not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time i arrived at the counter until i received my order since the time was obviously

recently i read a story that cappys has pretty much barred kids from the joint commatoken citing misbehavior periodtoken  well commatoken given that on my one and only visit to the place the

taste was more mackerel saba a much cheaper sushi fish than hamachi periodtoken  never going back there and the bill was 50 which in hawaii that would have fed 4 people with a full stomach at genki or

we speak to evan commatoken tell him what was missing from our order commatoken and he immediately responds by offering us to run the sandwiches back out with a coupon for twenty percent off our which is not likely at this point periodtoken while i appreciate the offer commatoken i am not going to wait another hour for a five inch sandwich periodtoken  he acts very surprised by the fact that it took an hour commatoken gives me an excuse about how he has been gone all day commatoken just got in commatoken and is making himself food periodtoken    i told him i would rather be refunded for order commatoken at which point he gets confrontational commatoken stating that even though way more than half our order is messed up commatoken we can still eat the other sandwich commatoken so he takes off the veggie and the chips gracious of him commatoken considering i never got the chips and we hang up periodtoken    the boyfriend bites into his italian to find veggies that he ordered

crock pot cannot be a part of the customized  standardized arbys franchise plan periodtoken    additionally commatoken we waited nearly 10 minutes commatoken while they fried an order of mozzarella sticks for my friend periodtoken i guess it was a slow night for the staff bc the guy working the deep fryer thought it  would be cool to throw the mozz sticks to the prep cook who was waiting to

she wanted the mozzarella sticks that had fallen on the floor since commatoken in her words commatoken the actual mozzarella sticks hadnt hit the floor or if we were willing to wait for them to fry up

periodtoken","6400":"this location is supposed to be open until 1 am and i came up at 10 pm and it was closed periodtoken i think its fair to mention that all of these other reviews are correct in

vietnamese sandwich periodtoken you guys have to understand that these banh mi sandwiches are a dollar in asia they are 23 dollars in california but for some dang reason they are 58 in the heart of the usa periodtoken i ate it up gratefully and happily periodtoken it wasnt as good as the last banh mi i had which was in se asia mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and i felt fine after eating it commatoken but it hit my craving spot like a hammer periodtoken  along with a banh mi was an order of goi cuon spring rolls periodtoken the rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap periodtoken im sorry for not sugar coating commatoken but it was absolutely crap periodtoken like i tasted it and was like commatoken dude wtf is this it was bland commatoken and the strangest color ive ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce periodtoken it was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture

market commatoken there may be no coming back  it gets worse periodtoken the viet iced coffee tasted like soap periodtoken i cannot explain it periodtoken did they not rinse the glasses throughly

on the counter periodtoken then swat at it with his hand periodtoken then move things around a bit and try to kill it again periodtoken in my mind i imagined a cockroach was his victim periodtoken i watched and watched periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip periodtoken why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food like i said commatoken im used to bugs commatoken i dont like them and they still gross me out commatoken but i can convince myself some stuff is okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but why not wash your hands bro take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go

periodtoken","6496":"my girlfriend and i decided to meet here for dinner last night a wednesday periodtoken i was stuck in traffic and she was at katies for 40 minutes before i arrived periodtoken she said she was seated promptly and courteously commatoken but thats where the service ended periodtoken   in the 40 minutes that she waited at our table not one person acknowledged her commatoken no one even filled the water glasses commatoken which were empty when i arrived periodtoken the table was only about 15 feet from the bar commatoken where the wait staff was constantly coming and going with food and drink orders periodtoken it is impossible that no one noticed her periodtoken  a few moments after i arrived commatoken our water glasses were filled commatoken bread was set out and we were told our waitress would be with us in a moment periodtoken after hearing my girlfriends story commatoken we decided to give them 10 minutes from when i sat down and in that 10 minutes no one else acknowledged us commatoken or took a drink order periodtoken  so commatoken after my girlfriend had waited 50 minutes without so much as a drink order taken commatoken we left and went down the street to the wolf where we had a great experience at a fraction of what i would have paid commatoken and they only had two waitresses working periodtoken  i cannot comment on the food commatoken but the other reviews of the noise levels are accurate periodtoken it is very loud commatoken and they seem to amplify the sounds of screaming children periodtoken another issue i had is that the wait staff had no uniforms or name tags or anything to indicate they worked there commatoken it was very chaotic periodtoken   i understand this location is new commatoken but im in no rush to return and give them a second chance periodtoken","6501":"this is a really bad establishment overall periodtoken we found the restaurants decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed periodtoken its a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of taiwanese culture periodtoken  first of all commatoken the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the bay area commatoken which thusly does not introduces competitive taiwanese restaurants periodtoken if this restaurant were in the bay area commatoken the restaurant would be sure to go out of business periodtoken at the restaurant commatoken we ordered stinky tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars periodtoken that equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece periodtoken that is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces periodtoken besides from that commatoken we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the bay area taiwanese restaurants periodtoken   the waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible periodtoken the waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment periodtoken in addition commatoken as we left commatoken the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips periodtoken this is ridiculous periodtoken i understand that the all people want money periodtoken or else why work the problem is that he doesnt mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it periodtoken  the decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant periodtoken i found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably periodtoken i loved the painting of taipei 101 on the wall as well periodtoken the kitchen was opened to us and from what i see commatoken the kitchen looks pretty clean periodtoken  the thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to nonwhites periodtoken the waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however commatoken offered less then decent services to us nonwhites periodtoken we found this consistent throughout the restaurant periodtoken now commatoken i honestly dont care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptable periodtoken","6504":"the experience was a huge disappointment periodtoken i hate cold food and bad service periodtoken i experienced both here today periodtoken our food was cold commatoken that wouldnt be a problem except it took 30 mins  for two burgers and a

periodtoken but there were only 4 tables taken in the entire building when we were eating periodtoken   next was the service or lack of service periodtoken  we had to find and carry our own high chair to the booth commatoken seat ourselves and ask for straws and silverware periodtoken this service would have been bad for a self service burger joint like flaky jakes periodtoken i had to ask for my check commatoken which took a long time and when i looked at the bill total commatoken i would have been better off feeding my whole family at steak n shake for 15 less periodtoken  im shocked that a

surprised to be working and shocked that customers were walking into the door periodtoken   this will be the first and last time eating here periodtoken noting worse than a below average burger from a

ordered a burrito commatoken it took 20 minutes to get it after many people were served in front of me periodtoken service in this establishment sucks  everything in this restaurant needs to change  commatoken they need to train and hire people who truly care about their work periodtoken they really need to toss out the old food they over cooked and not force it down the throats of their customers periodtoken french fries commatoken beans commatoken salads commatoken egg commatoken taco meat periodtoken im sure the corporate offices would agree commatoken but no one comes out here to correct it periodtoken i predict if they dont fix these issues soon commatoken they will close for a lack of customers periodtoken","6518":"i had hoped for authentic mexican food commatoken even a

periodtoken    i ordered the chili rellenos commatoken  which the server brought out and asked who was having the chili dinner periodtoken  ive never had a fruity chili rellenos commatoken but this one was filled with raisins and pine nuts with very little spice or sauces such as chili verde or rojo periodtoken    my opinion commatoken being raised in new mexico commatoken and extensively traveling mexico and spain was that this was an artsy attempt to upsell mexican cuisine periodtoken     i heard reactions to the enchilada meal as being very coconut heavy in flavor commatoken and even a taco bell reference periodtoken    if you wanted more authentic mexican food id direct you to the closest applebees commatoken chipotle commatoken taco bell periodtoken periodtoken

me on my complaint periodtoken","6528":"i was very disappointed to see that the casino is charging 10 to park periodtoken  i think theyre making a huge mistake periodtoken  this is by no means a destination or upscale casino periodtoken   there is really nothing there except a second rate casino periodtoken  the restaurants are average at best periodtoken   i read the casinos response to other yelpers commenting on the parking fee periodtoken  claiming that its to improve security is definitely something i dont want to hear periodtoken  what casino doesnt make security a number one priority  whether or not they are charging a parking fee should have no bearing on the level of security they are providing to their guests periodtoken","6534":"me and husband went there to have dinner expecting to just have a normal dinner it was completely horrible service was terrible didnt even leave her a tip how bad she was the appetizers came raw and cold and the stakes was over cooked

commatokenrice and black beans periodtoken the rice was dry and hard as well as the chicken that was also dry and little meat commatoken also had the ice tea periodtoken sad to say the ice tea was the only good thing periodtoken looked for a clean table but they all appeared to need a good cleaning periodtoken neadless to say i will never go there again periodtoken corporate should check out this store in oldsmar and shake up the staff periodtoken","6652":"my wife and i decide to try the new fridays menu this week and was it awful periodtoken  i had the roasted marrow periodtoken  it was a mess commatoken two large segments of bone one having a core that was smaller than my little finger with nothing to extract the marrow periodtoken  i finally got a small spoon but had to use the handle to dig out the grossly undercooked marrow periodtoken  the other piece of bone had a larger core but it too was undercooked periodtoken  i havent had marrow before but my understanding is that it is supposed to slide out of the bone periodtoken  not even close periodtoken  i had ordered escargot as an appetizer and they had a metallic taste with undercooked garlic in the butter periodtoken  my wife ordered the shrimp with grits and the shrimp all four of them were tasteless but the grits were terrific periodtoken  my dish came with a salad which was adequate but not tossed periodtoken  anyway commatoken ill stick to breakfast which i have had before and is quite good periodtoken","6655":"this was the first time at this location and we put in an online order periodtoken after we got home and opened our food we realized the guac was old periodtoken we each got a scoop on our entrees and an extra cup of it for our chips periodtoken we werent even able to eat our meals because of

with and ask to speak with a gentleman told me they were busy but he would get her periodtoken  really he then came back on and asked me what it was in reguards to so i told him periodtoken about 3 minutes later the manager picked up and simply said hello periodtoken she didnt introduce herself commatoken didnt appologize for the hold commatoken or anything periodtoken so i then said  commatoken hi commatoken did the gentleman tell you why i am calling and she said no he didnt periodtoken so i explained to her again periodtoken she told me the guac was made last night and thats why it looked that way and that i can come back in for a refund periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so many things about this expierence and this phone call were so wrong this manager needs to be put through

location","6656":"i have to admit im surprised by my experience periodtoken when i saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 4 periodtoken5 average i expected something more than what i got periodtoken  i ordered the falafel platter which came with tabouleh salad commatoken hummus commatoken mixed vegetables  a side of pita periodtoken  as a whole commatoken everything seemed to be at least a day old periodtoken everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it periodtoken  if i ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower commatoken i would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because i would be unstoppable periodtoken  the pita commatoken i would not serve to small children nor the elderly because its a choking hazard periodtoken it had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school periodtoken   you know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke you want some coffee with your sugar well thats what they would say about the amount of parsley in the tabbouleh periodtoken  i understand tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley commatoken but this was to the point where i couldnt call it tabbouleh periodtoken  they just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in periodtoken  the hummus was not that bad periodtoken it tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini commatoken but overall it was just ok periodtoken  the overall taste of everything was not bad commatoken but it did not resemble anything that i would call close to good periodtoken think of a delicious cheesesteak from pats or ginos or dalessandros thats a day or two old periodtoken  it would taste like its a day or two old commatoken but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh periodtoken i cant say that with the meal i just had from smileys periodtoken  it didnt taste bad like i could not stand putting it into my mouth commatoken but i cant say i found it even pleasant periodtoken id get as excited for it as i would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water periodtoken  i think i rate very fairly and it hurts me that i have to give this establishment such a low rating periodtoken i will admit that there is a possibility that commatoken given the other stellar reviews commatoken i may have just had a rare bad experience periodtoken unfortunately commatoken that is all i have to go off of periodtoken i may try it again some day if im with somebody who really wants to go there periodtoken  until then commatoken no thanks periodtoken","6658":"im done with this place periodtoken  they have a good selection but there employees are infuriatingly inconsistent periodtoken  when they get a rare item commatoken they will lie to your face when you ask for it

commatoken and delicious to some people but i have to totally disagree with anyone that calls it healthy as it certainly isnt periodtoken  they do offer lots and lots of nice looking desserts but everything on the menu commatoken other than the soups commatoken seems very heavy on the carbs commatoken fats commatoken and sugars here so i think some girls delude themselves that they are eating healthy here just to justify being able to order the super desserts as a reward for their healthy eating if i ate this kind of food ratio often i would be huge periodtoken  the menu is also a bit on the expensive side for the small portion sizes periodtoken    they really didnt have anything i liked i love meat but dont eat pig but the soups were decent but not good enough for the price periodtoken  this is definitely a place for a light lunch periodtoken  il posto really just reminds me of a coffee shop that decided to throw in some sandwiches but use some quality ingredients to make them a bit fancier periodtoken  the seating area is tiny and has very little space periodtoken    i just find this is a place for dainty girls to eat and not men so i will never be back as it just isnt my type of food periodtoken  if you like this type of food and like light lunches this is certainly a place you might want to check out periodtoken  if im in this area i will be going to pascals manale or charlies steakhouse instead for my healthy food ","6661":"my pizza was so bad i had to order from somewhere else on the way home just to eat periodtoken theres barely any cheese on

tasting the 3rd bagel commatoken i called them to ask for 6 more periodtoken well commatoken the owner was angry  inappropriate periodtoken he sniffed each of the 3 bagels that i returned  said

at least an hour and a half if youre going to eat there periodtoken   too many better options in this city to settle for this place periodtoken","7217":"went to this location before and liked it fine commatoken but i went just now and terrible periodtoken the person who took my order was perfectly nice commatoken  the person at the window didnt look at me commatoken overcharged me commatoken did not give me a receipt commatoken and closed the window in my face without speaking to me periodtoken the store was not busy at the time so i cant imagine she was helping someone else periodtoken on top of all that commatoken my iced coffee was no good periodtoken three ice cubes floating in warm coffee is not iced coffee i didnt have time to go in and try to fix it or i wouldve asked for a manager periodtoken ugh periodtoken","7219":"i really wanted some tacos commatoken so i decided to stop by here periodtoken the cashier that took my order was very nice and accommodating periodtoken overall commatoken my tacos were bery bland  commatoken sloppy and lacked flavor periodtoken although the ingredients sound good on the board periodtoken the ingredients dont really shine through and all you taste is mush periodtoken for example commatoken i had the pork taco w jalape\u00f1o slaw periodtoken the slaw was chopped very fine  and seemed more  like relish periodtoken all you taste is watery mayo and nothing resembling jalape\u00f1o periodtoken  shrimp taco just lettuce and red mayo that was supposed to be spicy  mayo periodtoken no spice at all and my shrimp were very hard as if they were just reheated and not fired fresh periodtoken  you would be better off getting tacos from taco bell periodtoken one thing i will say commatoken my salted caramel donut was amazing the salted caramel was the right amount of sweetness and the cake donut was moist and not greasy periodtoken s  i am eating healthier and wasted my cheat day and 11 on this periodtoken no more cheat days","7223":"i was so excited to try this place because they had a great yelp review and it was recommended to me by my cousin you recently traveled here periodtoken but i had a really awful experience here periodtoken the service and the food were absolutely terrible commatoken i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy periodtoken   we were seated and waited about 10 minutes to just get a glass of water periodtoken  after we were seated and kept waiting we asked the hostess if anyone was going to get us water periodtoken she looked at me blankly and then walked away periodtoken then we waited even longer to get water and to order periodtoken   we ordered the eggs florentine periodtoken the waiter messed up one of the orders and instead of poached eggs one of the eggs were over easy periodtoken the whole thing was swimming in some sort of liquid periodtoken also the hollandaise sauce was cold periodtoken the hash browns were cold commatoken completely unseasoned commatoken and not even brown periodtoken the waiter never checked in on us to see how we were doing periodtoken   there are lots of lovely brunch places in new orleans commatoken but this is certainly not one of them periodtoken","7226":"my wife and i have been to upland many times over the past few years and have always had a good experience periodtoken it was on our list of go to places in carmel periodtoken the beer is very good coastbuster is my favorite and the food has always been very good as well periodtoken we are vegetarian and there have always been some good choices commatoken and our very favorite was the southwest tofu salad periodtoken i say was because when we sat down on the patio last week we were shocked to see the salad was taken off the menu and replaced with another tofu salad that simply is nowhere close to the southwest periodtoken the tofu tacos are also changed to a new version of bland fried tofu that comes out a bit greasy periodtoken when we asked our server the reason for the change we were told the chef found the southwest tofu too time consuming to prepare so he took it off periodtoken never a good idea to remove a top selling and delicious item from your menu out of mere convenience for the kitchen periodtoken in addition they have taken off the vegetarian pizza option in favor of a meat version periodtoken ill go back for beers now and then but upland is off my list of go to places for a great meal periodtoken sorry upland but you should listen to your customers and not your cooks periodtoken","7227":"when i went to pick up my pizza commatoken i saw that the girls making the pizza were not wearing any gloves i asked about it commatoken and they confirmed that they dont wear gloves to make the food well commatoken i went against my better judgement and still ate it after reheating it periodtoken big mistake after eating my chicago style pizza commatoken which was pretty average commatoken i ended sick for the rest of the night periodtoken definitely not going back here","7231":"bland commatoken nothing special abt it periodtoken a to go joint periodtoken  if you decide to eat there you will be served a plastic baggie with watery wasabi commatoken and plastic cup with nasty tasting soy sauce periodtoken really wanted to like this place but besides the cool look commatoken it was a huge disappointment periodtoken btw commatoken the specialty rolls are ridiculously small for the price periodtoken","7233":"well we started being seated by creepy chick that stares into your soul when giving you her red robin visit quiz periodtoken let me stop there and ask commatoken what difference does it make if ive been to red robin before let me guess commatoken theres menus with food on them commatoken perhaps a variety of fountain drinks commatoken and a bathroom for people to warm the porcelain after they digest the food   we ordered the chips and french onion dip that tasted awful it tasted like they used a while packet do french onion soup and a teaspoon of sour cream periodtoken  i ordered a turkey burger that tasted like the soul of my chuck taylors i wore in 4th grade p periodtokene periodtoken class periodtoken  my boyfriend didnt complain about hid burger commatoken but it had avocado and bacon on it periodtoken you can put those two ingredients on dog poo and it would be good commatoken which im sure was the case of his burger periodtoken  never going again periodtoken wanted to barf it up when we left so i could reeat something decent periodtoken  the bottomless steak fries is ridiculous periodtoken if you need a second helping of fries then you also probably need a cardiologist periodtoken","7234":"just walked in at 840 pm to find they were out of the bread i wanted and one other periodtoken they were cleaning and had the cutting boards removed so thank you for doing so but just an fyi customers dont really want to see whats under them as the guy put my bread down on the bare metal albeit on paper i saw my bread hanging over and touching the metal counter top right next to a scrapper of some kind with black goo on the end periodtoken disgusting commatoken walked right out itll be a long time before i come back here periodtoken","7235":"absolutely horrible periodtoken i ordered grubhub for lunch today periodtoken i ordered chicken tikka masala and garliccheese naan periodtoken my order arrived not even 15 minutes later commatoken i work about a 15 min walk away periodtoken this really worried me because they have a menu where you can order your food and they have a lunch buffet periodtoken as soon as the driver called and said he has arrived i was not too happy because i was worried and assumed that my food was just scooped from the buffet periodtoken well commatoken i opened my food commatoken cold periodtoken cold chicken commatoken cold naans periodtoken pissed periodtoken being preggo and hungry and wanting a specific craving only to have it arrive cold and totally tasteless is such a let down periodtoken for 2 dinky naans and a 12oz container of food scooped from a buffet cost me 22 periodtoken a freakin ripoff periodtoken","7236":"went to dinner at 730 with my girlfriends intending to eat wings and potato fries and get out within an hour periodtoken our server commatoken rose commatoken was extremely slow commatoken showing barely any attention to us yet could spend minutes talking to tables filled with boys periodtoken for about 30 min she was just straight up mia periodtoken when we finally got her attention commatoken got our checks and sent them to be rung up commatoken we received our checks back with our credit cards at 930 2 hours after we initially sat down one was missing and another one was attached to the incorrect bill periodtoken my friend had to get up from the table to find her missing card where she eventually found it in a puddle of water on the bar next to some crumbled up napkins periodtoken they were out of potato fries and every single one of their desserts periodtoken usually love the outpost but after tonight we are probably never going back periodtoken","7238":"we will not return to this place periodtoken ordered fried green tomato sliders and mushroom swiss sliders  bread was cold and hard and most of the sandwich was bread  meat was flavorless periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken fried mac n cheese was ok but the onion rings were greasy periodtoken  bill was 39 for two people crazy for not good food periodtoken  sorry commatoken burger up commatoken we wont be going back periodtoken","7239":"i have been coming to arners for 30 years and unfortunately commatoken it seems to have taken a turn for the worse periodtoken  first you have to understand this restaurant is was a delaware staple commatoken a go to place for good service and food periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhaving seen the remodel after fire damage and it just keeping up with the times commatoken i have to say i was super disappointed    i took my son for a special sunday morning breakfast periodtoken  after driving for 45 minutes commatoken we arrived just before 10am periodtoken  the first thing that struck me was the empty parking lot commatoken i totally expected to get there and wait for 30 minutes for a table but not this day periodtoken  we got sat right away i only saw about 710 other tables sat periodtoken  servers timing was fine and we ordered right away periodtoken    my son ordered hot chocolate which isnt something he get regularly so this was a big deal that he was allowed to have it and of course he wanted whipped cream periodtoken  then the hot chocolate arrived commatoken it had a clump of white stuff on top which looked like sour cream commatoken he took a small bite because it didnt even have enough to cover the top of the hot chocolate so a big bite wasnt possible and i was sure he was going to make an oh my gosh commatoken i just ate sour cream commatoken face but he made a oh my gosh commatoken i just ate weird whipped cream commatoken face periodtoken  i tasted it to be sure and although it wasnt sour commatoken it wasnt whipped cream but more like part way whipped cream so i mixed it into the hot chocolate but the unmixed commatoken solid cream bits were too much to over come and he didnt touch it again periodtoken  we ordered creamed chip beef commatoken strawberry waffle and an omelet periodtoken  the omelet was fine cooked well and tasty periodtoken  however commatoken the waffle was covered by the same sorry excuse for whipped cream as the hot chocolate we scrapped it to the side and enjoyed the waffle all the same periodtoken  the whipped cream looked like an attempt at homemade whipped cream gone wrong or from way too many minutes ago as it was part thick clumps and part runny sauce periodtoken  the creamed chip beef was more like lumpy sauce with a few pieces of chipped beef very few the taste was ok but it obviously had been sitting around long enough to coagulate making it thick and gloopy if thats a word periodtoken periodtoken periodtokena little thinning with some milk would have made all the difference periodtoken  because nothing tasted bad and it was all edible commatoken i didnt mention it to the server periodtoken  but commatoken she never asked why it wasnt eaten either which i feel would have been appropriate for her to do periodtoken  as we sat and waited for the check commatoken my son asked what was under the booth across the isle periodtoken  after looking at the baseboard which he was talking about i explained to him it was just not clean and had lots of splatter on it periodtoken  so commatoken of course commatoken now i look around and notice lots of things which were not clean periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenfood splatter on the booth wallsglass commatoken small foodpaper debris all over the floor commatoken dirty light fixtures commatoken server area was messy periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbasically this place needs to close and deep clean the dinning room things needs to be scrubbed commatoken not wiped off commatoken scrubbed  if this is what the dining room looks like what on earth does the kitchen look like  on a side note commatoken watching servers fix their hair and wipe at their eyesnoses is gross periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey need to be told not to do this in the dining room periodtoken  when i paid commatoken the cashier asked me how everything was and i looked at her commatoken shook my head and told her it was very disappointing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenheres the kicker commatoken she said nothing after that  she didnt ask me what was wrong commatoken what happened commatoken why i was disappointed commatoken nothing periodtoken  i responded to her question and told her i was disappointed and she said nothing in response periodtoken  this is such a shame that an institution commatoken a local business commatoken has let things go so far wrong that the employees dont even care but a guess if the owners dont care commatoken why should they","7243":"the worst service ever periodtoken im pissed at apparent intentional disreguard of my buisness by the drive through person periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken very unprofessiinal  unfriendly commatoken i guess its a cultural thing to treat your customers like they are not there  that they are not spending your money with your buisness periodtoken    i ordered my food paid for it  waited periodtoken a few minutes later a different woman opened the window commatoken ruddly shoved the food in my face commatoken closed the window and walked away periodtoken she did all this without acknowlaging me commatoken  looking at me  without ever a single word periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i took my order  the woman quickly turned commatoken closed the window  walked away periodtoken periodtoken  no thank you commatoken no question  if i may have needed anything else commatoken like taco sause  nope commatoken just windo open commatoken shove food commatoken window close commatoken walk away periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i feel like my buisness held no value to these people periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken in this new america a big supreme right  so commatoken since i really wanted  needed some taco sauce for my tacos commatoken i stayed parked at the window hoping she would return periodtoken i waited there for the woman to acknowledge me as she could see i was still there and looking to her periodtoken she seemed to intentionally ignore me  the woman continued with other tasks never giving me a second consideration periodtoken periodtoken after about a minute and a half more i put my car in gear commatoken drove away and immediately wrote this review periodtoken hey jimboys in sparks commatoken fuck you   from now in its off to del taco and american owned company were they trian their employees to provide reasonable customer service  to respect and value thier customer periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   i will not be back periodtoken periodtoken","7248":"so very disappointed booked this through open table at 9am  friends came up from chattanooga got a call at 350 saying no reservation periodtoken not

periodtoken my kid doesnt like mustard on his burger and the other one doesnt like lettuce i ask for this every time and have received maybe once correct outta the dozen times iv been periodtoken i live in the area so i enjoy my coffee before work 15 min for an incorrect coffee order gets old fast periodtoken i will be traveling to the weber greens mcdonalds from now on periodtoken i only gave them one star because it wouldnt let me give zero periodtoken","7262":"i have eaten at sylvias three times and i have been disappointed every time periodtoken i remeber my mom maaking salmon croquettes when i was a kid commatoken so i was excited to see them on the menu at sylvias periodtoken but these were dried clumps of bread filler with a hint of fishy tasting salmon commatoken and a side of  some sort of okra slime periodtoken  the second time i ate there i decided to go in a different direction commatoken so i ordered the ribs periodtoken these were worse than the salmon croquettes periodtoken  the ribs were huge and plentiful but they were really tough and fatty commatoken  and slathered ina a sweet but odd tasting bbq sauce periodtoken i ate one and brought the rest home to my dog who gave them a five star rating periodtoken   so the third time i had tilapia commatoken it commatoken was better than the salmon or the ribs but still very mediocre periodtoken   why do i keep going back to a place that i dont like well i do some work there occasionally commatoken contract work not an employee commatoken  and they are nice enough to feed me periodtoken unfortunately everything i have tried has been pretty bad periodtoken  i will be working there again soon and i will continue to try different items until i find something decent periodtoken i cant recommend this place commatoken i eat for free and have yet to like anything enough to even finish a meal periodtoken i would not waste my money at sylvias periodtoken","7263":"not impressed

hmmm i dont know maybe no milk periodtoken is it that hard of a concept   the size of the smoothie that i received after they finally remade the drink was smaller than the first  therefore i over paid for my drink which really pisses me off seeing as i paid 10 for two smoothies periodtoken   never again i dont recommend anyone getting a drink in the place periodtoken horrible periodtoken","7272":"there is nothing hot or ready about this place periodtoken i walked in hoping just maybe there would be a supreme ready to go periodtoken not even cheese or pepperoni were ready

a little bit after us periodtoken  okay  first come commatoken first serve commatoken right  maybe both parties tipped her to get bumped ahead  doubt it at this place periodtoken  so commatoken we step outside to get some air commatoken and another 20 minutes goes by periodtoken  at this point commatoken its 8pm on a sunday commatoken and i left periodtoken  still never received that text

was surprised that in royersford commatoken where prices are normally lower in comparison to the mainline where we incur our cost of living commatoken nelsons prices were comparable if not higher than

chef poon periodtoken while hes clearly a very enthusiastic person commatoken this was far from a real culinary tour periodtoken instead commatoken this was more like an opportunity for chef poon to talk about himself and to boast about his accomplishments and life story periodtoken chef poon has evidently had a successful career commatoken but many of the things he said were difficult to believe commatoken at best periodtoken furthermore commatoken it seemed impossible for him to talk about the virtues of his cooking and his life philosophy without criticizing the cooking and philosophy of

the assumptions he made about people that all americans are rich and have never had to work for anything and are lazy and their interests that women would want to hear about herbsspices that have been

for the check commatoken it took 47 minutes i timed it to arrive periodtoken   the second experience was last night periodtoken i decided order via the waitr app and ordered a poke bowl periodtoken the app allows you to select ingredients from a menu and add them to a dish periodtoken when the food arrived it filled less than half the normal sized container it arrived in periodtoken it was also

overrated commatoken slider not burger place i have ever eaten at periodtoken no skill commatoken no flavor commatoken and no creativity coming out this kitchen for sure periodtoken baileys commatoken get it together please   pickles were pretty good commatoken however commatoken my preference for fried foods is breadcrumbs commatoken not tasteless easy to prepare batter periodtoken the rest of this review commatoken however commatoken is truly not based off of my preference but on common sense burger expectations   their burgers should all be called sliders periodtoken they are so small and thin commatoken and just thrown between cold yogamat ingredient buns onto an overcompensated oven tray with thin measly toppings hanging off the side periodtoken   first of all commatoken i asked the waitress how pink their medium burger is commatoken and she said its mostly pink commatoken because the mediumwell has barely a sliver of pink periodtoken so i ordered a medium ballpark pretzel burger commatoken and my husband ordered a medium american burger periodtoken unfortunately commatoken mine came out completely bone dry well done my husbands burger came out mediumwell but barely any pink periodtoken   in addition to the dry overcooked meat commatoken we both cringed at the taste of the cheese sauce on our burgers oh my goodness gracious commatoken idk if it was homemade cheese sauce or from a can commatoken but it tasted absolutely horrendous commatoken like a cheap peanut butter cheese wiz sauce   so i said no way commatoken please make me a totally different burger the basic create your own now with sliced white cheddar commatoken bacon commatoken and red onion medium this time my husband was starving so he just ate his he has more tolerance for the bs these restaurants are serving up these days anyways periodtoken  my second burger comes out now commatoken so the waitress asks that i cut into it for her and sure enough it is hard as a brick and more well done than the first one i didnt think it was possible but before i could say anything the waitress said omg i am so sorry and grabbed it away to get yet another one made for me  my third burger comes out commatoken and my husband is done eating his slider by now commatoken so i cut into the burger again for the waitress and now there is only a sliver of pink periodtoken definitely not medium commatoken and closer to medium well but even more chewy than the first one the waitress said is this ok i said not really commatoken but my husband is already done commatoken and i wanna leave so i took a few bites out of the third burger and left the rest for my husband who was still clearly starving after eating his mini snack of a slider the attached photo is of the 3rd burger before i gave it to my husband periodtoken   it was so bad commatoken even besides being extremely dry and overcooked periodtoken it was truly tasteless commatoken and a little chewy periodtoken did they just shape ground beef into a patty and call it a burger i mean really commatoken no seasonings commatoken no splash of personality or creativity to make it their own range burger i have had tastier juicer burgers at wholeinthewall diners  oh commatoken and the buns have you ever seen those kids kitchen play sets with the squishy burger bun that takes it original shape back as soon as you let it go yeah commatoken thats exactly how both the pretzel bun and regular bun was ew commatoken i think that was the worst part periodtoken they were cold commatoken greasy commatoken and must have had the yogamat ingredient in it a burger bun should be slightly toasted commatoken fresh commatoken and lightly buttered periodtoken the bun should be the second most important ingredient to the meat periodtoken   the toppings were pathetic periodtoken my red onions were thinner than the red onions in the watermelon salad and looked as if they were soaking in water and lost their freshness the bacon was not crispy or worthy at all commatoken it was floppy and chewy periodtoken   my husbands burger commatoken the american burger with macaroni and cheese commatoken and bacon had a melon baller dolup of mac n cheese commatoken and tons of that questionable cheese sauce periodtoken he too commatoken said whoaaa whats going on with that sauce and made a confused face   thank goodness for the french fries and watermelon salad or else i would have left starving the fries were really good commatoken actually periodtoken they were warm commatoken had seasonings commatoken and seemed fresh periodtoken watermelon salad wasnt the best but wasnt bad commatoken it was actually refreshing periodtoken   the bourbon bacon milkshake was pretty good too because it had chopped bacon in the mix commatoken as well as two strips sticking out periodtoken   the brussels sprouts looked so disgraceful and lonely with their lackluster wilted cherry tomatoes and halfmelted cheese on top commatoken all scattered in an oversized casserole dish periodtoken   its actually funny now thinking about this meal periodtoken burgers are their main item and they failed miserably periodtoken i dont know how they stay in business commatoken or how people can rant and rave about this place its not like i got one bad burger commatoken i had three make that four if you count my husbands dry ol sad slidersized burger  the journey for a decent burger in st periodtoken lou continues periodtoken periodtoken","8318":"never going again very slow and rude service periodtoken they didnt honor a

lazy ghetto kids playing on their phones periodtoken they make sandwiches at their convenience periodtoken  i ordered commatoken  no one cooked anything for like 10 minutes periodtoken  only after the punk finished his conversation with a co worker did he consider starting my order periodtoken later saw the cook rolling a blunt in his car in the parking lot on his break periodtoken no wonder the food and service sucks there periodtoken","8324":"great food horrible service we drove all the way home to find out that our burrito we ordered wasnt in the bag periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we

small and dry periodtoken in fact commatoken all the meat slices for the steaks were small and laughable for the price periodtoken what was even funnier was a server was telling another table that

much bigger and the top sirloin was not a once in a lifetime offer periodtoken   overall commatoken it was more disappointing on all fronts and for the high price commatoken definitely not worth it

ridiculous periodtoken   i say if you want to go to a great steakhouse commatoken go to texas de brazil for good portions and great service periodtoken its definitely your monies worth periodtoken the

periodtoken","8715":"my family and i were spending the day walking around the french quarter commatoken and i found the fidgety on google maps periodtoken i was so excited to check it out commatoken

pretty expensive commatoken there were no seats which my family was needing commatoken and my parents found the staff to be insulting periodtoken   my family arrived at the shop at a good time commatoken making us first in line periodtoken however commatoken by the time the staff made our order of two milkshakes and an ice cream cone commatoken there were 20 people in line there were five people working commatoken but only one woman was taking orders and preparing ice cream periodtoken the rest of the staff appeared to be completely oblivious that there were customers waiting commatoken which started to greatly upset some of the parents with young children periodtoken there was no sense of a line commatoken so people were being helped out of order commatoken and the staff was rude about it periodtoken after making a milkshake for me commatoken one staff member asked wha my brother wanted commatoken who also ordered a milkshake commatoken and snapped at him commatoken complaining that he should have informed her before she made my milkshake although she gave him no time to do so periodtoken   additionally commatoken when i inquired about gluten in certain milkshakes the staff members had no idea what i was referring to commatoken telling me i should not order anything in the store because there was dairy commatoken cream commatoken and sugar all up in the milkshakes periodtoken even when i explained what gluten was commatoken and that i was not referring to dairy commatoken the staff was unable to identify what milkshakes had gluten commatoken and seemed to get an attitude that really upset my parents periodtoken ultimately commatoken my dad ended up not ordering anything at all commatoken because the staff gave my brother and i such a hard time periodtoken he felt like ordering was an inconvenience on the staff commatoken and thus did not want to pay them any more money than we already were periodtoken   all in all commatoken my family found that the fidgety was not worth the money or the wait at all commatoken since our two milkshakes and one ice cream cone cost just over 20 periodtoken the allergen risk was too high commatoken and the disrespect and disregard to customers was so surprising i hope it was just a fluke and that maybe we caught the staff at a bad time periodtoken however commatoken if you do have any allergies commatoken if you have young children that maybe do not want to wait 40 minutes unnecessarily for a milkshake commatoken or if you are simply interested in better service commatoken i would recommend going elsewhere for a sweet treat periodtoken","8720":"my husband and i are regular customers here periodtoken we always order the same thing for every visit salty almond chocolate and creole cream cheese periodtoken we also always tip a dollar to our cashier commatoken but this time i didnt want to tip our cashier anything because the scoops she gave us was very very tiny when we sat down to

periodtoken i am not a big fan of the other flavors they have because all of them are super sweet periodtoken so i told her it is ok commatoken no big deal periodtoken i didnt eat or finish my ice cream after that for fearing of getting diarrhea or food poisoning later periodtoken i really think that the milk or cream cheese used in that particular batch probably expired already for it to be that sour yuck i just left the ice cream on my table periodtoken later on ive decided to get a new one in my husbands favorite flavor instead of wasting my money periodtoken our cashier was willing to get us a new one commatoken but the look on her face was filled with attitude periodtoken no smile commatoken no apologies commatoken no nothing periodtoken later she came to our table and handed us

minutes before our waiter came to the table and took our drink order periodtoken we ordered two beers and 3 sodas periodtoken about 10 minutes later we had no drinks periodtoken the waiter came back

we were told our beers were on the way periodtoken 15 minutes later the beers arrived periodtoken 30 minutes into our visit and we just now had our drinks periodtoken we waited for close to another 30

disappeared for another 15 minutes periodtoken he came back and said that our food was not ready periodtoken the server tried to blame the delay on a large party at another table and the kitchen couldnt keep up periodtoken it was a saturday night and the restaurant was not busy how is the kitchen not able to keep up needless to say after waiting over an hour we did not stay to see home much longer the food took periodtoken we paid for our beers and left periodtoken","8726":"i yelped gas stations periodtoken this is just a wawa store commatoken they do not have a gas station or even a

impossible to find periodtoken i went inside the checkers and they did not have signage for their two for three deals so i asked the cashier and she was unable to put together whole sentences and communicate the menu to me in a professional manner without getting extremely ignorant and ghetto because i did not understand periodtoken i am sure people wonder why that location does so poorly and that is why periodtoken they were completely empty with no customers which is why i went there in the first place because the mcdonalds right next door was bumping periodtoken i went back to mcdonalds and received great service even though they are very busy periodtoken i hope management sees this and fixes their problems","8745":"we ordered from smileys very often through grubhub periodtoken their

periodtoken i thoroughly enjoyed the corn chower commatoken until i found a hair in it periodtoken the grilled cheese was awful periodtoken the crab must have been fake and there was just a little

husband and i were an annoying interruption periodtoken walking us to our table seemed to be physically exerting for her periodtoken that is the level of service you can expect here periodtoken attitude reflects management and the employees behave like they hate being there periodtoken perhaps it is because the servers do not get to keep the tips periodtoken they ask if you want to leave a gratuity before they bring the check and ask for the amount making it awkward periodtoken the check comes totaled including the gratuity periodtoken this is an indication that they are pooling the tips and management gets to decide how they are distributed periodtoken its tipping the business not the server periodtoken how much does the restaurant keep we had the fried chicken and the batter coating was very heavy commatoken improperly seasoned and burnt periodtoken it was pricey for a bbq place but the quality of the food and service did not justify the price periodtoken hendricks has

sugar periodtoken i felt dirty eating this ice cream and that usually only happens when i eat a triple cheeseburger with large fries at mcds periodtoken    usually the ice cream is too sweet but i dont complain since it has at least some taste periodtoken now it seems like they are cheaping out on their qualityquantity to maximize profit periodtoken     service was also lacking as i felt like

periodtoken they were very quick to say there was nothing they could do commatoken and they dont give access to outlets to the public commatoken or apparently even paying customers periodtoken never in my life have i seen a coffee shop so stingy periodtoken they eyed us down as we walked out the door periodtoken im sure they have great coffee commatoken and we would have definitely got one if we didnt have this experience periodtoken however we will not be returning periodtoken i hope they can fix their customer service issues soon periodtoken","9577":"tried 3 weeks in a row to go 730 periodtoken closed periodtoken door says open til 9 but i just snuck in at 727 and they were cleaned out periodtoken the less than pleasant woman working there said they close at 730 every night periodtoken and she wasnt even nice about it periodtoken wont go back periodtoken","9579":"when i presented an entertainment coupon and met all the coupon requirements commatoken they still tried to find knit picky excuses that were not listed on the coupon to try to get out of honoring coupon periodtoken i had to threaten to return the take out food before they gave in periodtoken and they still were nasty periodtoken  and then the pastrami was full of grissel and fat periodtoken the french fries were cold commatoken greasy commatoken and limp periodtoken the chicken breast was dry periodtoken  do not eat there   send a message to restaurants that do not treat their customers with respect periodtoken","9583":"we visited this location while shopping in hyde park and it was pouring rain periodtoken there was no slip mat at the front door and i was the first person to walk in the door periodtoken i fell so hard and slipped on the wet concrete no warning sign and the entire store looked at me periodtoken they didnt offer to help me or at least a free coffee periodtoken","9584":"slowest service ever periodtoken  and the snoballs werent nearly as good as hansens or plum st periodtoken","9585":"this was our firstand lasttime at blakes lotaburger commatoken for a number of reasons periodtoken  when we arrived commatoken the place was packed periodtoken parking was at a premium commatoken but we wanted to eat in commatoken so we finally found a place to park periodtoken there was a long line inside commatoken and it was moving very slowly periodtoken we were on line for approximately 18 minutes before we finally made it to the counter periodtoken once there commatoken we placed the order wed had plenty of time to think through periodtoken we both ordered the lota combo periodtoken he asked for nothing on his burger except cheese and onions when asked if they had any other sauces for the burgers commatoken like maybe commatoken 1000 island commatoken they did not periodtoken i have gluten issues commatoken and asked if they have glutenfree buns they do not periodtoken i ordered mine bunless periodtoken the combo comes commatoken according to the menu commatoken with a large drink and a large fries periodtoken their large drink is something like 30 ounces commatoken but their large fries is smaller than a regular size at certain large chain restaurants periodtoken the price was fairly reasonable commatoken no real complaint there periodtoken  we went off and found one table to sit down at to wait for our food periodtoken the dining room is far too small for the numbers of people wanting to check out this new restaurant that may not be a problem for long commatoken however periodtoken there are no salt or pepper shakers commatoken no available napkins on the tables or in the dining room periodtoken  there was a young man running orders out to the tables commatoken and it was at this point that i realized how backed up they really were periodtoken our order number was 844 the runner was bringing out orders in the low 830s periodtoken people who had already found tables before we entered the restaurant were just getting their food at this point commatoken wed already been in house approximately 25 minutes periodtoken it took approximately another 15 minutes to get our food periodtoken when we got it commatoken our first disappointment was the fries periodtoken not that they were unpleasant they were not particularly hot commatoken more along the line of lukewarm commatoken and they could have used a bit more salt periodtoken when he opened his burger commatoken there was cheese commatoken but no onions periodtoken he had to go to the counter for it commatoken and wound up with the equivalent of the small round of onion periodtoken the patty was thin and dry commatoken and we were both disappointed at the fact it was only one patty periodtoken the picture next to the lota combo clearly shows a double patty burger periodtoken when he asked about it commatoken he was told they have had a large number of complaints about that periodtoken  over all commatoken the experience was far less than all the hype had led us to expect periodtoken we wont be going back periodtoken if we want a good burger commatoken well go to graze across the street periodtoken","9586":"yuck commatoken yuck commatoken and yuck

periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9589":"not impressed i had ordered a birthday cake with very specific instructions for the decoration periodtoken the cake didnt even come close to what i had asked for and the baker decided to add her own design which was just horrible periodtoken the writing was terribly written periodtoken got past the exterior and tried it periodtoken the worst cake i have ever eaten periodtoken i would not recommend ordering a cake from here periodtoken the worst part is that i was picking this up the day before the birthday and was essentially stuck with it periodtoken i would have been better off with a birthday cake from a local grocery store","9590":"long wait and when it was finally our turn some girl took her friends who were behind us first periodtoken had to wait another 5 minutes with two small hungry children periodtoken food was wrong commatoken fries were awful commatoken kids were done eating before my husband even got his food back periodtoken server i am hoping was just new she was horrendous periodtoken and both my husband served and bartenders and are as understanding as we are not periodtoken the manager seemed preoccupied with his servers and chatting while tables were dirty commatoken and people waited for just the servers to get to the tables periodtoken let alone needing boxes which we never got and left our half of our food after it came back to our table cold too periodtoken server walked by numerous times without asking anything commatoken while we had empty drinks commatoken and empty plates periodtoken than us being optimisticor naive our girls wanted shakes periodtoken terrible terrible mistake 20 minutes later commatoken and the 1 guy in front of us we had 4 shakes was still waiting on

flavoring periodtoken i used to get is all the time in texas and the flavorings were unsweetened too periodtoken my drink came out tasting like sickly sweet cough syrup periodtoken so they either artificially sweetened the flavoring or added the flavoring to sweet tea by mistake periodtoken i reported that the drink wasnt what i expected and the manager acted as if i didnt know what i was talking about but said she would get us a regular unsweet tea periodtoken we waited several minutes commatoken called for service again and were ignored periodtoken decided it wasnt worth the trouble and went to mcds for a large unsweet tea periodtoken sonic never again periodtoken","9595":"i love the wing lovers meal periodtoken  it is what i eat at el pollo loco periodtoken  rarely is it not

first commatoken and last commatoken trip to el pollo loco periodtoken the person taking the order didt understand that i wanted 5 chicken avocado tacos periodtoken these are advertised on their website and they are advertised on their commercials periodtoken i got to the drive up window and showed the employee a picture of the taco from their website that included a description of the taco periodtoken she had to call over the manager and they both looked at it like it was something from outer space periodtoken they seemed to finally understand and filled my order periodtoken when i got home commatoken the tacos were all ice cold 5 minutes to my home the chicken was filled with tendons and even pieces of bone periodtoken there was no avocado in three of the tacos and the two that had avocado was just a small amount hidden at the bottom of the tortilla periodtoken there were 3 containers of cilantro sauce and 2 containers of pico de gallo commatoken keep in mind this is for 5 tacos periodtoken they charged me an outrageous amount of money for 5 chicken avocado tacos which only 2 of them really were periodtoken needless to say commatoken there are better fast food restaurants that serve what you order and especially know what is on their menus save your money and dont go here for a chicken avocado taco or you will be loco for sure","9597":"i swear to god they have messed up my coffee 5 times in a row its like a joke to me now lol idk why i dont learn my lesson periodtoken i have never had one good experience here periodtoken the customer service sucks and you can just

asked about our food periodtoken  he told us that they were experiencing a rush periodtoken  we reminded him that we had arrived well before said rush periodtoken  he said he would check on our order and eventually came back with more coffee informing us our food was on its way periodtoken  much later commatoken still no food and we asked a different server who was also going to check into it periodtoken  we finally left after a 45 minute wait with no food or explanation for the deplorable lack of service periodtoken  we have patronized this restaurant in the past experiencing reasonable
