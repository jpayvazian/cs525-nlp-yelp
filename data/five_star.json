falafel commatoken a pita or roll commatoken a generous helping of some of the best grilled commatoken marinated chicken that ive ever tasted commatoken and two other items periodtoken one of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce which is always good periodtoken the other is often a sauce or fruit item periodtoken   recently commatoken the chef has also been handing out cups of

uniqueness and not quantity periodtoken  the beer selection is by far the best in the city periodtoken  they also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits periodtoken  some of the spirits can be had for less commatoken if you are going for the more common ones commatoken the ones that can be found elsewhere periodtoken  ive had several conversations with different staff commatoken and they

for the house tea periodtoken also commatoken i have gotten great service both times i have been here periodtoken dont be afraid to ask them to adjust the sweetness periodtoken   the only issue i have

gawd i love this stuff keep in mind i was skeptical periodtoken i usually stick with single speed commatoken which is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum commatoken but when literally every other person you are with is drinking this reeses cup beer you eventually take a sip commatoken and discover that it is delicious and you kick single speed to the curb and end up roaming around randalls like a crazy person until the nice girl stocking beer notices you and carries over a bottle asking is this what youre looking for and you want to hug her periodtoken but i digress periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  if you cant track down the peanut butter commatoken their regular chocolate milk stout runs a close second in my book commatoken and this is coming from someone

crazy crowded in here on weekends commatoken but the bartenders are efficient and it never takes long to get a refill periodtoken they also have limited seating outside on the sidewalk commatoken which is awesome on warm days commatoken and they generally have an amazing soundtrack going periodtoken   if drinking round after round of beer gives you the drunk munchies no just me you can grab a snack from fifth wheel commatoken which is basically a tiny baileys kitchen that offers up nachos commatoken pretzels and other pub fare to go along with your beer periodtoken order and pay at the

the board commatoken including vegetables commatoken meats commatoken cheeses commatoken and salads like tuna and white bean periodtoken some of my personal favorites are the butternut squash

gem periodtoken all of the pastas are homemade commatoken and they usually have 1 or 2 specials every night periodtoken all of the pasta creations are worth trying commatoken but the ricotta gnocchi will change your life periodtoken before zeppoli commatoken i had never had a ricotta base gnocchi commatoken and now i cant seem to enjoy regular potato gnocchi anymore they are like eating little clouds periodtoken the brown butter sauce and crispy sage are the perfect accompaniment periodtoken if the squid ink pasta is ever on special when you go commatoken be sure to get it  the space itself is tiny commatoken but very romantic and intimate commatoken with just enough room around each table for the servers to pass through periodtoken sometimes i feel like im sitting on top of other diners

they also serve shakes commatoken root beer floats commatoken and other confections commatoken none of which i have tried periodtoken  the only downside to this location is that there are only two or three small tables inside periodtoken  being that this is a popular spot in the summer commatoken the tables fill up quickly and you are relagated to sitting outside at tables that are shaded commatoken but still in the heat periodtoken even so commatoken it is worth a trip when you are in the mood for a yummy treat periodtoken  this is a family owned business that is just starting to offer franchises and expand into other locations periodtoken","4377":"this is a great place for breakfast when you are visiting montecito periodtoken  the greek omelet is amazing periodtoken the
