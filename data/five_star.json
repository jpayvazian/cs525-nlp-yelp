monday i jogged up the stairs out of the 19th and market green line station and was basically punched in the face by the amazing smells coming from this food truck more than a block away periodtoken id eaten at the falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose i knew what i was going to be chowing down on that day periodtoken  the food at this truck is amazing periodtoken while the meal varies quite a bit from day today commatoken there are a few things you can generally count on a portion of delicious hummus commatoken some really good falafel commatoken a pita or roll commatoken a generous helping of some of the best grilled commatoken marinated chicken that ive ever tasted commatoken and two other items periodtoken one of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce which is always good periodtoken the other is often a sauce or fruit item periodtoken   recently commatoken the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line different soups every day and a bottle of perrier with the meal periodtoken he does not list a price but generally charges 10 commatoken which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day periodtoken   its also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated periodtoken he is a real character and

here if you are very particular about your food periodtoken he gives you what he gives you and isnt going to be making anything specific to your tastes periodtoken its also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be  usually its relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot periodtoken i wouldnt count on being able to get a description before getting served commatoken so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting periodtoken i also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies periodtoken   that said commatoken if you can get past this you are in for a really flavorful meal at a good value","2953":"our 6 year old wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday party periodtoken he picked out the triple chocolate
