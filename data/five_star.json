and theres just a lot of space to do work the noise level is perfect the music is at a perfect level and i always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs ill keep giving them my business for as long as i

finding a diamond inside another diamond super yummy","6":"great burgersfries and salad  burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor  this location is very quaint they only have outdoor seating  friendly staff  street parking as well as parking lot in the back","7":"great staff always helps and always nice always clean and huge store size stays stocked with everything you need the staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel","9":"what a great addition to the funk zone  grab a bite grab some tastings life is good right next door to the santa barbara wine collective in fact it actually shares the same tables  we had a fabulous savory croissant","12":"my brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in ended up staying and having a few while playing their nintendo 64 super smash brothers which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons its a great place with good food and genuinely nice people should be a staple in the northeast","13":"we were a bit weary about trying the shellfish company on the wharf as more often than not many places like these see cannery row monterey feast on a captive audience and provide substandard fare at high prices  however emboldened by the perennial good reviews on yelp we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out the place is small so definitely plan ahead you will have to wait so either you know just do so or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours luckily our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off  the special was the local rock crab  25 for 3 lbs of california rock crab salad and your choice of soupchowder after taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out the wife and i both opted for it as it looked awesome    the saladchowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each so it was a good start as much as i liked the chowder however the shrimp bisque the wife ordered was amazing so i would recommend that going forward   but enough of prattling on about side dishes the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked juicy buttery chunks of white crab meat await you just a few cracks away while the rock crab shells are pretty thick once cracked they splinter and separate easily a good sign they are cooked to perfection the rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what i felt to be the least amount of work youre going to do for crab king or otherwise   we were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value devouring the rock crab at sbsc turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip i think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed","14":"ive only had the cannolis here but they are awesome theyre freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal not too sweet its perfect if you like cannoli if you dont think you like cannoli you should definitely get one from termini bros","15":"after living in the stl area for way over 10 years now i am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that i ate here for the first time just a few weeks ago i am ashamed because its a st louis tradition and remorseful because i missed out on it for somanyyears   this place is amazing what is not to love its a factory where you can get a tour fridaysunday noon5pm on the hour theres a shop bar and dining area they also host many event with live music on the weekends its fun to just kind of wander and look around  dont worry youll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine the beer is of course amazing the hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker like myself additionally the food is homegrown and damn good i had the pizza recommendation from my server and it was really spectacular though im admittedly a pizza connoisseur so i enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably p my date had a bison burger which was also really good   more fun info the service is great i think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people like tattoo parlor staff which i support the quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery   it is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality it is worth it i will go again and again and you probably should too","20":"i had the pleasure to meet with ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and

beer in town by far seems like the concept is a few notches up from fig mountain definitely prefer topa even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the nook restaurant and walk two feet into lama dog which is part of the waterline i love it","27":"i first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a franklin local  he recommended that we brave the line and try one of nashvilles best breakfast spots  he was right  holly cow this place kicked butt and we didnt even have to wait in line we were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress   i had this super savory corn pancake with bacon salsa and sour cream so good this place will always be a stop when i get back to the south","28":"not sure why it took until now for us to find this place we started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic a friend recommended lobster haven and i checked it out online looked like a type of place we would eat at in massachusetts when we visit family we were not disappointed service was great fast and very friendly huge selection of all of the favorites you have to visit this place if you want authentic new england seafood you can

starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily  yeu the owner serves not only your common popular donuts but he also serves donuts with bacon on top apple fritters pigs in a blanket breakfast pastries and  kolachesin addition to these yummy treatshe makes doughssantsthey are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant need i say more

so much for so many reasons first off whenever im on my way to sweet divas i can smell the spices wafting from this little inviting shop second they have such a large range of spices that you can smell taste a little and purchase yes theres a large overwhelming variety of spices but fear not their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs over the years ive purchased many items from here and i can attest that they do last a long time about a year year and a half including some stuff i use often i see all kind of specialty salts for example onion salt celery salt as well as sugars and powders lavender vanilla sugar vanilla bean powder their products even seem to taste fresher i can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what i can get at a dollar store for example the prices arent too bad and they last long my three bottles pictured cost about 19 but that will last a good year so its worth it to me","45":"lots of improvements to this place much more comfortable environment now  the chairs could be a bit more comfortable as itd be nice to sit through an entire football game otherwise this place has really improved","46":"my mother aunt and myself went on this walking tour of ybor with stops for good food  what a nice time  our guide  raymond was very knowledgeable and friendly   it was about 3 hrs long  we passed that 3 hr mark because we were sidetracked a few times and chit chatted quite a bit lol  we learned great details and background about the early days of tampa the culture people and ybor in general  very informative along the way we stopped for food tastings  everything was great  especially the stone soup company cuban sandwich  i would recommend everyone to go on this tour  visiting or lived here for years this is a fun adventure  and for the step counters we chalked up over 5000 steps  it will help offset all the wonderful calories you take in on the tour haha","49":"love this bakery great breakfast sandwiches coffee and donuts my friend and i love coming on weekend mornings","50":"this place always delivers yet another

store with only a few tables now it has been transformed into a wine bar he offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver he had two guys playing music he offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge my friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well he does have a few tables out in front this is a great place","55":"great store insane selection incredible customer service  wish they could come to ft mcmurray   ","61":"so worth the wait the crepes are amazing i also loved the grits which is rare

but i havent been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic  my most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches which are served all day i particularly enjoy veg sausage w havarti on an everything bagel i could actually go for one right about now ive also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant everything always taste fresh they are priced really well  i think my favorite bagel sandwich i mentioned is 209299 cheaper than wawa the people at the deli are super helpful offering menus if you cant read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want  dont forget to grab a really great snack too while youre there they have amazing chocolate bars an incredible drink case tons of chip varieties and those addictive hichew candies in every flavor  i know ill be back here who doesnt like fast  delicious  attentive service","64":"the depot burger is so delicious along with the shishito peppers perfect food perfect atmosphere perfect drinks","69":"i moved from chicago to philadelphia over a year ago  everybody here raves about the restaurants but i have yet to find many that deserve five stars or even four  this is the best restaurant i have eaten in in philadelphia    tahini and bread  arrived at the table and i thought hum plain but im hungry  they must put crack in that tahini  i wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog  the bread is excellent too  i love a menu with many organic meat choices  how often can you order an organic beef shishkabob  it was superb  the meat done perfectly the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch  the purslane salad tasted like i was eating a plant in the middle of a garden  it is not often that i dream about a salad but i do dream about this one  my husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice  i wont begin to describe the flavoring it is beyond my culinary vocabulary  we asked what spices they use and in addition to traditional zatar they use their own blend of spices  i dont even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again  i was so full but ate dessert none the less which i usually dont do  but when a diner is this good i had a feeling the desserts would be too and i just needed to find out  pistachio creme brulee  it could have come out over the top but no indeed  it was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard  heaven heaven  our service was superb  the squeezed us into a last minute friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us  given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly  then my husband left to go to the restroom the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table  do i care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal  not really but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained    my eating out plan for philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so i can frequent this expensive though appropriately priced restaurant  kudos to the chef","71":"this is the place for authentic indian street food ive been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri pav bhaji vada pav deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki dabeli kulfi and more everything was made exceptionally well  i regret not having found this place sooner","72":"best smoothies in the whole world and fresh bread is amazing very knowledgeable staff","73":"i stopped by bell meade during a recent visit to nashville the best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time i go to nashville i will go out of my way to make sure i return to bell meade  on my travels i tend to stop from time to time to see if i can find specific bourbons that may be out locally at this time of year i did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which i look have their annual release later in the year so its a surprise to find any of them on the shelf for example elmer t lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that i asked about  despite the fact that i walked away without elmer t i still had a great time i enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better i had a great conversation with max he is one of the reasons i will return  i did walk out with a bottle of tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that i have not seen locally that i need to investigate as i said i will return and a five star rating from me should say at all","74":"i love trying fresh seafood on piers wharfs and seaside markets most of the time it is a disappointing experience but this place is not the food is legitimately fresh and prepared well the gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of natures beautiful sundae i have been here before but ordered the wrong thing cioppino that wasnt very good when i had it a couple of years ago here   we came for a late lunchearly dinner on a monday even at 4pm  there was a wait we waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor while it wasnt ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses the view was worth it   we got the local crab special which was a steamed 3lb crab served with a salad and soup for 26 i thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge delicious and meaty the garden salad was fresh as simple as it was the lobster bisque we got was pretty good the other options were caesar salad and clam chowder they topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter yum  we also got the fried platter of shrimp oysters calamari and scallops for 1295 it came with cole slaw onion rings tartar sauce and cocktail sauce as greasy of a meal as this made it was one of the better fried platters ive had anywhere the seafood was just really fresh including the sometimesfeared fried oyster   the ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it we did because it was hot out she was just friendly and good at her job  five stars for her  by the time we left at about 6 there were so many people waiting make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there the restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires i parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier it was free on a monday late afternoon","78":"the food at ghinis is just delicious everything for french breakfast imaginable and more i highly recommend the eggs provencale not something you can get anywhere else two eggs basted with a sliced hot house tomato thyme garlic and herbs de provance get the

pastries   their coffee puts starbucks dd micky ds and all the rest to shame   their pastries are incredible  you would have to fly to boricua  puerto rico to even come close    my business is in neighboring pennsauken and we are there every morning","95":"one of the best burgers in philly  low key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room but dont let the modest face fool you this place rocks  menu is creative and fully customizable burgers are cooked on a flattop perfectly seared juicy slightly charred fries are hand cut fried fresh perfectly crispy and salty what more could you ask for from a burger place   pro tip  download the spot app for a rewards program and some good coupons aka free fries","96":"after trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes i finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line i had heard of the food truck nazi and that it was the best in town and found gus the falafel nazi as he called himself lived up to his reputation and more  as my turn came up i approached the cart tenuously for i did not want to blow it by asking too many questions he immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside falafel was delicious as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it there was enough food for 2 people well worth the wait","97":"another fivestar dining review  fresco servesup wonderful fresh and tasty pizza  we tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit tucson during the gem shows  for what you get their prices are very reasonable  my husband and i were new and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza how it is made from all fresh ingredients etc  the restaurant was very clean and inviting  we ordered the meatspecial pizza which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage pepperoni ham and bacon  the pizza was great  crispy and tender crust plenty of toppings and a multiplenapkiner  we also had a nice talk with the young owner and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers  we will definitely return next year  do i recommend frescoyou betcha i do","98":"i cant say enough great things about the baked goodies that come out of this kitchen  i have yet to have anything that is subpar  everything comes out with full flavor and with the right texture then the delicate and decorative detailingjust phenomenal  you can tell that time and love goes into each piece of goodness  i love all of the signature flavors  i am a classic cupcake person and absolutely love her

primarily a dessert place seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics   i always enjoy the shaved ice when i come here the kind seasons offers is a different type of dessert that i havent seen anywhere else the variety of boba tea that they have is also very  good among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco if you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional 150 charge for a large size there are predesigned concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors the pre designed concoctions are a better deal  seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall across from a large shopping plaza with regal cinemas and marshalls with plenty of parking the store itself is clean bright and modern and is kidfriendly as there are high hairs available for use   the service has always been friendly fast and efficient seasons employs an order at the counter take number and food is borough out to you when ready model   i cant comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which boon touts as the best food item there the quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all   i look forward to many more visits with friends at this location check seasons out and enjoy","104":"this place was absolutely awesome 75 cent oysters after 2 dozen i moved to the excellent cheesy grits great place to eat even better during happy

sourdough toast with a fried egg and sweet potatoes sooo good highly recommend this place","109":"i honestly didnt know this place existed until my friend suggested it for brunch over the weekend i cant believe i live four blocks away and havent been here before i ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant im one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was

really sums up in a very good way my interactions with delicious designs and leigh anne  our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed  as the weeks went by the guest list increased so i decided i wanted a cake  with probably less than a weeks notice leigh anne stepped up and made the exact cake i had in my head  i asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations  not only did she make this happen beautifully she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute    im attaching a picture of the cake table  my daughter did the decorating and i must say for someone with not much in the decorating department everything came out better than i could ever imagine  and not only was the cake perfect it was yummy delicious  i cant wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer   if you are in need of any bakery needs in reno and you dont use leigh anne with delicious designs well then all i can say is im sorry","122":"the best place to go for gyros the quality of their food is amazing i always get chicken gyros here but they have all kinds of goodies my daughter loves their burgers and the

saturday for a tour and beer sampling since yuengling is one of his favorite beers we never knew it was so close  be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the faqs   first note there were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs the insisted closed toe shoe policy but that could be because of the next note  second note there is no productionbrewing on saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty  we looked around the main waitinglobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin  we had quite a large group which had to split into two smaller ones the tour lasted about 40 minutes starting with a ten minute video of the history of yuengling and the rise to present day next the guide takes you out to the brewery and into the kettle room around through the lab the bottle line and the holding tanks the tour was informative and hands on our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process she did a great job  once done you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and its drinks galore the best part free tips are encouraged  we tried the premium lager lager and black and tan sadly they were out of the lord chesterfield this day and the premium light is not available here in fl  overall a great tour and i will be revisitng with my parents when they are in town","148":"our 1st visit here we went

a devils delight and the girl giggled  of course i was confused she explained it was devs delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her devil dev  hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute after she took my thorough of a medium burger and truffle fires i didnt have to wait very long even before i ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering  the burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing  this burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom what great idea for a burger for a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect excellent quality and service  a bit expensive but worth every penny no question about it i will be a return customer","152":"i was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when i came across this place after figuring out what i wanted and put the be my bison burger in my cart for the online order i realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job defeated i started to search elsewhere but i could not get that burger off of my mind i came back a few hours later and submit my order i hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as i walked in  i grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work omg absolutely in love with this place it has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true thank you","155":"dave was very nice and explained the menu the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious hit the spot daves special pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeos too santa barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this","156":"yeah i know what youre thinking one wawa store is pretty much the same as another so why even bother writing a review but i think we have a winner here  when this wawa store opened for business gas prices at gas stations all along concord pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them sure this wawa store couldve followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents keeping the bulk of the profit but no theyll have none of that i love a store that is on the side of my wallet  secondly i love the automatic startstop digital air pump so far ive only seen that at bjs wholesale and sheetz its a snap to use and i get the exact tire pressure every time  as for service they seem nice and relatively efficient the internal layout of the store is the new style that i first saw in newark having separate noncigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods although ive never been there during the day so i wouldnt know","160":"great service and awesome food we go here all the time each time it is excellent very very

nominated for a james beard award and it shows in his flavorful and diverse menu choices the restaurant has both an outdoor and indoor setting with double doors that allow access to both with a bar around the corner   i personally have tried every taco on the menu as well as the appetizers each taco uses fresh local ingredients with an option for vegetarians and meat eaters like myself my two favorites are the mushroom taco and the short rib taco both have unique and fantastic flavors but i would recommend trying them all you will not be disappointed overall a great place for lunch or dinner i will definitely be going back soon","169":"according to my experience there is just one place in tokyo at the fish market where you get your seafood a little fresher here in santa barbara it does not get any fresher right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate dont expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here though the outside seating has a nice oceanharbor view it is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds the wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it put your name down and take a walk on the peer to freeup some extra room in your stomach  youll need it","171":"this place is so lovely i went for a sweet and was amazed at the variety the gooey butter cookies were

little on the small side but it is well worth it   cant wait to try afford their steaks  food 55 service 55 price 45  a little high but great quality","182":"walked here from our condo and found this awesome place delicious slidersdonutsunique drinks awesome atmosphere and the staff was sooooooo friendly will definitely be back","184":"due to its location in a strip mall near cool springs this version of the twelve south hipster gourmet burger up is certainly not as trendy but it makes up for it by delivering the goods awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings the regular fries are delicious until you try the truffle fries they are truly outstanding not greasy and finished with paresan cheese the metaphorical cherryontop was the chocolate milkshake which actually had no cherry on top the shake was nothing fancy but perfectly made creamy not too sweet or overchocolatey  if you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burgerfriesshake

accommodating we probably could have ordered a bit more advanced  cant say enough positives about our experience so glad to know i also have a location closer to me in old city wish i could have another piece of that cake","204":"let me start by saying that the food here is by far the best mexican i have had in st pete  its nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to weekend nights do get a little hectic so i would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order for the meat lovers out there you cant go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazing","205":"wings wings and more wings  chatham tap is my favorite place to get wings in the indianapolis area  they are meaty the sauce is great and i usually always have to take some home for the next day  i went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu  i highly recommend the onion rings  they have a large selection of beer as well  since i heard they were a soccer bar i did not know what to expect when i first arrived  however the atmosphere is great  it is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on tv  the service was excellent  no one in my group had to ask for one thing while

nothing special   but the burger is the best","231":"this place is absolutely amazing a cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive i walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if i should make a purchase the employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings  definitely try some and you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste you cant really make a proper judgment because there isnt enough to judge from not the case here  i got the salted caramel banana the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake  thoughts omg i never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert but man after this i wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding although i highly doubt that i could make it half as good their desserts are crafted perfect  threefour layers depending on what you get the bottom layer the the pudding second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cakewhatever it was  it was amazing third layer the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping the creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth everything just comes together so nicely   the upside pineapple cake was bomb the cake wasnt too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to taste like what its suppose to the pineapple flavor isnt overwhelming but just right my only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too caramelized with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew  definitely go to this place i was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip they use an ipad to ring you up the servicehelp was so great and i would have left a tip but i had no cash any ways highly recommend this place for desserts","232":"i

salad bar options it was like a waaaay less expensive whole foods on the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs this would be my go to store if i lived here for sure big plus its local   fried chicken was bomblicious","236":"we tried these at the collingswood art festival this weekend they are a bit pricey but worth it the flavor is perfect they arent greasy i will be seeking them out once you try them you will want to have them again they are a light cheddar curd battered and friend you dont taste grease or batter the flavor of the cheese is delicious and so stringy and melty the sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd well worth the splurge","237":"beers were amazing i got the porter the double ipa and the table gutt and they were all fantastic food was also killer if you like russian cuisine they had a special when i went with a sausage and sauerkraut which was tasty i also got the pickled everything appetizer great choice this place rules","240":"you need a

here to eat my pancakes","246":"we went here hoping for a good breakfast  and we werent disappointed  we went on valentines day not because we wanted to but because we had to  in doing so  we knew the wait would be long which it was an hour and a half though i hear theres always a wait   the place is buzzing with servers and busboys the tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another  so seating is tight  the service was though considering how busy it was  i ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg  my girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon  everything was amazing  the pancakes were hearty but fluffy the side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing  but it was cooked to her liking  the cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything bacon  peppers salsa sour cream  syrup yes  all of that  if youre looking for good coffee  this is not the place which was surprising   the only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple or both","251":"finally warming up for yogurt they have crepes here too its awesome come try them","252":"i moved to philadelphia from the midwest as a wide eyed 19 year old full of wonder yuengling lager was the first beer ive ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time smooth sweet cheap its like me in a bottle i love that the bottlecaps can be rusty i like that the taste varies per batch i even like its relatively low alcohol content   the tour was pretty great the british tour woman was funny in a non canned way she took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat signed sports i havent a clue i was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment i couldve spit in the mash and no one wouldve been the wiser the whole facility reminded me of st pete catholic high 50s cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls   the tasting thats what you came for right fantastic they were out of lord chesterfield but who drinks that i tasted the shit out of the lager probably 6 times it makes sense the bar is next to the gift shop and i went a bit insane in there   the fact that dick yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star this is a family business one that deserves support as inbev has encroached upon everything else","257":"first i love that they offer food delivery second that is a gyro i got one delivered with fries and actually i didnt need the fries the gyro was so big i had to save half  both the fries and the gyro were very tasty the tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender ill be back","261":"love this place introduced almost 25 years ago when i enrolled at the ud

review is not about this specific location but if it is half as good as others i have been to it will be great this location has plenty of seating was real clean and playing good tunes as i waited about only negative is it doesnt have herrs chips like the delaware locations but that is not really a problem","263":"i went to spasso the other night with some friends all four of us were so pleased

truck around stop and try you wont be disappointed","298":"spot on  i got the veg and the spicy fries  the veg is a portabella burger with grilled mozzarella picked veg arugula and gauc  wholly noncow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger  the bella is on bottom then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that  i actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasnt super melted a good thing the gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula  theres a nice bun to contents ratio and for bonus points its a potato bun  wasnt sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in  are they hot sauce fries etc  turns out they are of the crabfries variety with some subtle other spices added in  nice portion  not too big  the atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar  i think thats the best way to describe it  its pretty small so i wouldnt choose to ever eat in most likely","299":"best mexican restaurant ive been to in a long time food was great drinks were great and prices are reasonable","300":"ive been a fan of this place for a long time their hazelnut cake is awesome as are many of their other cakes i

live in jersey and i have driven here many times just to get food they are so friendly and provide great food at a great price","333":"the loose tea can get expensive  but i love getting ready made teas pretty wide selection always something new and they let you mix to make your own concoction always comes out perfect the staff are the nicest people around they remember me when i come in and remember what i like ","336":"my personal favorite wine and liquor store in nashville  the staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious  you can ask for a 10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at  the selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town    one negative the curb is a little bit high pulling in  dont gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your car","337":"i had just moved to nashville and one of my friends told me i had to come here were not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point anyways i went around 915 and the line wasnt too bad  id say a 510 minute wait the food was awesome i had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for the sausage side i had didnt rock my world then again its not the side dish pantry you dont pay at the table  they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast    rip  i drive by it almost every morning  if you want to avoid the line go either right when they open to around 715","342":"food is excellent people

prices  located where mugshots used to be rip one of my coworkers had been raving about this place in particular the falafel and of course the very kind owner  went with my prewife and we shared beef gyro carved pita falafel pita and hummus plate everything was extremely fresh i concur on the crisp lettuce well seasoned and just plain delicious  a lot of food as well and complimentary baklava we took our leftovers home i wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro  its that good  i highly recommend this place and youll definitely walk out with a smile i think this spot is still relatively unknown and i very rarely post reviews this is a unique spot to manayunk and i will be referring all of my friends as i really want the restaurant to succeed  because the owner deserves it and of course for my selfish appetite","348":"not only was the food excellent but the people here are beyond niceand genuine i had eggs benedict the poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on

lunch but never knew why  after being recommended to try it by a friend we decided to go ahead and order lunch here  cucina zapata is at the end of the food truck row at the center of drexel universitys campus  the truck has a graffiti style design which can be easily distinguished from the other food trucks here  i decided to order 2 thai short rib tacos while my girlfriend got the capn crunch tilapia burrito  the food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building  i really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it  they were definitely better than the typical taco bell food and left me with a 5 star review feeling inside  my girlfriend also really enjoyed her burrito  overall this food truck provides very good food at a good price  i recommend this place to anyone looking for a good lunch","353":"if you have not had their cream filled donuts then you simply have not lived my friend

food here is delicious   im surprised this place doesnt have higher reviews on yelp because it far exceeded my expectations   the guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy  i ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables and asked for it spicy  my entre had an attractive presentation on the plate ie looked classy and was delicious well seasoned and very fresh on my suggestion my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes ie a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds and it was tasty too   i should also note that the waitress was very attentive  when i placed my order i explained to her that i have mild lactose intolerance and cant eat much butter or cream but am okay with cheese so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil rather than butter  thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request    the prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual mexican food and i love the fact theyre a byob  the chef serves creative and inspired cuisine which has a traditional flair and style to it  in other words dont come here for regular tacos or burritos  come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price and bring tequila for the perk of byob margaritas","452":"awesome experience just ate here for the first time and wow it was good our meals came very quickly and tasted great our waiter lyndel was very amazing

earth and can hold a conversation with the layman  negative im reaching but i kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater  would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out

through but the food is still just as yummy    my salad rotation goes between the picnic basket and the go green but all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them  you cant

in house  i will always love companion and go for lunch a lot  its basically every week at this point","475":"this is a gigantic restaurant with ample seating and a nice ambience   beverages this is the perfect place for cocktails coffee and  cider there is a wide variety of drink selections and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu   starters the new orleans bbq shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo these little guys are like crack and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce   entrees the curried chicken salad is fantastic though i wish they would consider serving it on different bread it comes on two mini sandwich rolls the blt is also a good choice the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying   dessert i dont even know where to start the brown shugga pie is stupid good it never would have occurred me to order it because i dont sit around thinking about brown sugar but a friend of mine did and i ate almost the whole thing its ooey gooey rich and delicious the key lime pie is

the entire united states and it is so worth every last calorie","476":"i was in town for a short visit and decided to do some neighborhood exploration i was in the garden district and wanted some

off the tomatoes because it makes it too watery   the indulgent every so often choice is the pimento cheese pizza  this is greasy so blot the pie with a few napkins and double up on the lipotor and

my tire i turned them down but its the thought that counts i will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me  saturdays and sundays are the days my boyfriend and i like to shop here because of all the delicious samples the employees are all helpful cheerful and respectful place is clean youll find bargains and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere some of the generic costco kirkland signature items are just as good if not better than brand names  best of all i hear you dont even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices 150 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills 10 for a delicious whole 18 pizza too good to be true and yet it is  with competitive prices gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy and membership perks such as travel getaway packages i found i have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon cant say enough good things about this place and the company big fan","554":"stupendous customer service and exquisite food my favorite is the japanese pan noodles with marinated steak","559":"much better than the one on bell rd near red lobster

the thai sensation thai iced tea and lychee which was perfect the thai ice tea ice cream wasnt too sweet and lychee fruit was used so the mix of the small bits into the ice cream worked out well  3 toppings with a syrup is included for 7 dollars with tax for the novelty and show while they prepare your treat i think the price is very reasonable the toppings i got were mochi strawberry pocky sticks and condensed milk i think the picture will speak for itself   they opened 2 months ago and they will have no trouble attracting attention as a tourist to the area i was glad to stumble upon this location great spot to hang out bring a date or just get some solid ice cream   important to mention this ice cream will not be creamy common sense how can something that is prepared and rolled in this manner be creamy like say gelato if you come in with a realistic expectation youll have a better experience this wont be the best ice cream youll ever have but the appearance and novelty makes it worth trying","575":"three letters wow  food was excellent and relatively cheap for the fq  our waitress kerry was excellent  i had the big easy breakfast which came with lots of food that i could

everything over communication is key my friends now back the the pizza its as good as it gets in university city","588":"i am surprised the average rating is 35 stars for what it is a soccer bar i think this place is great and i actually prefer this location to the mass ave one  the decor makes you feel like youre at an english pub there are tvs everywhere so its a great place to watch a game  the beer selection is great the service is great and the food is good ive had their chicken salad sandwich wings and fish and chips and all three are good better than your typical bar food","591":"had a great experience place is really clean and has cool decor service was prompt and intuitive the food was delicious make sure to leave room for dessert the dessert menu is a picture book from their bakery prices were great as well","593":"after hearing good things about the screamery i thought id better check it out good location and very friendly staff to greet you with all kinds of information about why their ice cream is the bestest i was able to taste several different flavors before setting on chocolate peppermint i thought id try that sonoran chocolate but was told it was quite fiery maybe ill try it on another day  my final choice was very tasty i wish they offered more flavors but maybe that will come with time but other than that its a wonderful neighborhood place to grab some delicious ice cream","594":"i stopped in to buy my favourite macaroons from where else duchess when low and behold there is a store next door oh goodness it is a whole store by duchess filled with the

prices and excellent wines and cheese  heaven","597":"i found myself in the big easy for a convention back in the beginning of may i stayed about 15 miles from the convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me i went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that i felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast as i was strolling along magazine street i peaked in the window of what i thought was a pastrycakesweets stuff kind of place bittersweet confections for a moment i thought maybe they werent open yet because it wasnt crowded with a line out the door like others i had passed  then i glanced over at the menu and i spotted the breakfast menu  i said to myself give it a try why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere youre right here dude so i walked in and that is when my 3 day relationship started  yep it was so damn good i went back every day on my morning walk to the convention day one i asked to speak to the chef a lovely lady full of passion about her food and family recipes she makes a damn good biscuit i wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal healthy portions and i didnt want anyone to think i was dissatisfied she smiled thanked me and said ill see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after i could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day i would find someone along the way who hadnt eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day it was a wonderful experience  on my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of the spots the convention was over and i wasnt on any schedule we walked to the place she recommended a very popular spot with a very long line and wait i said i cant do this long line let me show you a spot i found so we took a nice morning stroll over to bittersweet boom another amazing meal there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes i overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes i can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets i was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts ive been having these kids are in for a real treat apologies for taking soooo long to sit down and post a review  5 stars","604":"this is our favorite italian restaurant by far the service is always good and the food is always delicious my husband and i have tried several different plates and they have all been very good the building doesnt look like much from the outside but its pretty nice on the inside their cheesecake is pretty amazing too","605":"holy donuts batman one of my favorite spots for a quick sandwich and some delicious

brother had a sundae  both were excellent  very creamy texture and flavor  line was long but was not that bad a wait  a lot of out owners like me but just as many locals","627":"this is literally the best hotel in the french quarter it has a fantastic location and there are many restaurants close by the hotel within walking distance the hotel has the right balance of privacy and services however there are not cabs readily available  but if you walk up the street a bit there is a cab stand the breakfast at the hotel is excellent i will definitely be back","628":"this is my favorite pizza place

 companion sure why not   oh the amazingly oily greek salad with potato salad underneath oh the pita and fresh hummus oh the perfectly spiced gyros with french fries oh the sweet sweet baklava   me

was nowhere near a starbucks so i decided to stop at this tim hortons i was immediately impressed with how clean the store was i have never been to a tim hortons before and maryann was super sweet and spent a lot of time explaining the menu the iced coffee that i eventually decided on was perfect you guys have got yourselves a new regular","645":"101 was delightful stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour  two for one drinks possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks but we both got boba teas instead  the scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer they came out hot crispy and a little oily delicious  the tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious all the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory sort of sweet flavor combo cilantro sweet sauce and a few other things i dont remember off the top of my head  the popcorn chicken was also excellent tiny very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad i didnt try the potato salad but heard it was more of a macaroni salad   i highly recommend taiwan 101 food is cooked quickly staff are nice and everything ive tried so far is absolutely delicious","646":"outstanding  the top shelf margarita was perfect and we loved the pork pastor and the red drum highly recommend","647":"i love this place this past summer i would go here almost every other day to buy a different kind of donut for my family to try the atmosphere is great service is great and the food is amazing not only are their donuts tasty as heck but their sliders are to die for as well if you are a donut fan or just a sweettooth you got to try this place note the food truck that you might see around town imo does not have the same quality go to the location on magazine st","648":"never gets old i get the chocolate malt with light on the chocolate best ice cream custard thing i have ever had in my life","651":"very very happy i tried this wonderful cantina it seems they have a new chef and my first meal here was amazing if you are a connoisseur of mexican cuisine please try this place i had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other mexican veggie  dishes around town   im so impressed and happy to find this gem my partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans  the red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman i worked with used to make for potlucks  i know i am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that its not typical the bartender iris is very helpful and was a great server also one more thing i want to mention the spicy margarita it is now my new favorite drink in town it has cilantro jalapeo and i believe cucumber and it is amazing","652":"cappuccios is by far one of the most amazing butcher shops in the city  on my first visit i was unsure of what to get  i popped in shortly before the place was going to close for the day but that didnt matter  the employees were beyond friendly and helpful  after some discussion i decided to go with some pork chops which had to be cut  no problem the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking  and man were they some of the best pork chops weve ever had  i had such a great experience that i went back 2 days later this time with my husband a lover of all things meaty  we were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff  the experience you will have at cappuccios is worth the trip alone but their meats are also exceptional  i think weve found our local butcher shop","658":"superfabulous i chose to patronize this store during my trip to new orleans simply based on the yelp feedback i was not disappointed fabulous this liquor store was more charming and delivered better service to me than the omni hotel the owner and his seasoned staff 24 plus years of loyal employees were so gracious plus they delivered to my hotel  ignore the outdated and dirty comments from others this place is quaint the best i mean the best bloody mary you can get for cheap folks  delicious with plenty of garnish i say they were better and more affordable than the bloody marys at pat obriens  i cannot wait for my next trip to nawlins and i will be back to this jointno doubt","659":"after a full day of snorkeling the ice cream was delicious  it is located inside of the hotel but if you ask they will let you park for free  they had a wide variety of flavors and starbucks coffee  seating is in an air conditioned room with old fashioned tables","660":"pizza was delicious had the meat eaters pizza the pizza was perfectly proportioned and filled me up and i had to take the rest to go i will definitely try and persuade the franchise owner to let me open my own blaze pizza in biloxi ms i can imagine i would do a lot of business god willing","662":"i had been stalking food trucks for some time when i finally landed somewhere that had five all together most were selling sample size items for a small prize at wctt you got three tacos for the same prize loved loved loved them served on corn tortillas with meat perfectly cooked you couldnt ask for more and friendly service to boot if you see this truck in your area high tail it over there","664":"fabuloso this place i hit every single time i fly to tampa  so deliciously tasty    the rice pudding is to die for    v","665":"my boyfriend and i dined here after buying a summer in the city discount card for tucson wed been wanting to try out new restaurants this one included so the added discount gave us that extra push everything about our experience was great we were seated immediately and our waiter came by shortly after he gave great recommendations on the wine and the specials i ordered the pasta dish of the day which was so fabulous he had  the bouillabaisse which was also delicious we were too full for dessert but the ones we saw being carried to other tables looked amazing our server was very attentive but not overbearing the atmosphere was lovelyintimate but still had the feeling of being in a public place which we like it was a great experience","667":"if you love pizza brooklyn pizza  cafe is where too go i eat here regularly and its always great the staff is really nice the pizza is always made fresh when i order it and its ready in less than 1015 minutes when i order it to go","671":"ive had about all of their sandwiches and visit this place when im in the area during lunch  i think their bread is great and their prices

burritos and vietnamese come often for pho and great vietnamese food but tried a burrito today for the first time i am hooked","675":"my family has been customers of georges for years you pay for what you get the quality of the food is premier and they dont hold back on portion size their cheesesteaks are amazing chopped steak and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their char platters which is legit their char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken ive ever had they make their own sauce so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use franks red hot i have yet to have something on their menu that i didnt like","678":"so my girlfriend is from chicago and id been searching forever to try and find her a place in tampa that had chicago style pizza shes pretty picky about it of course shes been used to the main 3 places up there that do it a little differently of course i was excited anyways because id never had chicago style pizza before  after all the worriedness that she had she was extremely happy with both the pizza and the awesome vintagey atmosphere the waitress was very friendly as well the selfserve beer cooler had a pretty good selection of craft beer though i would have loved to see more of my favorites there also the greek salad was easily one of the best id ever had in my entire life it was pretty epic  overall we had an awesome experience and will absolutely be going back again in the near future","680":"fantastic mexican truck   the guys there are very kind

wonderful service good for a date family outing and to take visitors","686":"the morning cuban it could be renamed gout on a plate but holy ht is this open faced breakfast sandwich good it comes on a thick slice of toasted bread the type they use for french toast with roasted pulled pork swiss cheese ham 2 fried eggs on top with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top creating a moat of nottoospicy green goodness holy sht this makes me think of the morning after breakfast after partying in miamis south beach with some bangin cuban honeys yes its like that this sht is soooo bomb i kept muttering expletives to myself as i dug through the plate with my fork damnnnn  actually even better than the normal morning cuban if you ask for a small cup of their house chorizo gravy thats even better with the openfaced morning cuban than the green house salsa   oh speaking of house they were playing some nice jazzysoulful house music while i was there pretty nice for atmosphere they alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while i was there i wasnt sure if it was a mix from their private collection or if it was just pandora   either way big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music  the peanut butter brownies are good but the rest of the baked goods didnt interest me i think 5th st bakehouses strength lies not in the baked goods but in their awesome sandwiches like the morning cuban in fact i want to go there right now","694":"so glad we found this place on yelp had a huge portion of delicious red beans and rice with pork shank and the boudin balls definitely recommend this place if youre in new orleans not far from french quarter with free parking","698":"this small but impressive sidekick to the much larger and more lavish oxford exchange makes a quick convenient alternative to those who want something good to go in a hurry  there is limited seating inside and the menu is not nearly as extensive as its namesake but there are plenty of of satisfying ways to appease your appetite sate your thirst for iced coffee get a boost from a juice or make a baked good grab and go  be sure to peruse the chilled section for all sorts of readytoeat goodies  oxford exchange has been a maverick at shaking up the status quo and this tiny countertop  and counterpart  carries on that tradition quite well","703":"just had my

whole lot of history and their processes in a short tour if you dont want to go on the tour its still worth stopping by to see all of the memorabilia in the common area the complimentary beer at the end of the tour is as fresh as you can get delicious","711":"awesome place very dope setting large party can crash and chill staff here super nice i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation awesome great place great beer  thanks all the staff for great hospitality","712":"my favorite pizza place in the area  friendly staff and the biggest slices of pizza

felt like we were overstaying our welcome  great food  great service","716":"the staff spent over 10 minutes on the phone with me answering all of my ridiculous questions about my serious dietary needs  what they have to offer two thumbs up for the patience and kindness they offered me","718":"if youre looking for a great place to start your day id go here great place for a simple breakfast thatll fuel you up for a day full of festivities portions are huge prices are great and the place is cute and quaint what more can you ask for a breakfast spot","719":"karma is very delicious i typically get the acai bowls or the energy squares that they sell i come here quite a few times in a month the only negative thing i can say is that when i order my bowls sometimes it has almonds and others it doesnt it kind of pisses me off because i love almonds so i expect them each time too little of a detail to ruins someones day about but i just feel it should be a little more consistent","720":"ive tried many ice cream shops in new orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list it has by far the best ice cream in town   as soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time it reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the south it definitely has that old world charm   there are so many delicious flavors to try and its usually hard to choose just one  however over time and many flavor tests i find that i tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors my personal favorites at the creole creamery are the entire chocolate section  located on your left as soon as you walk in more specifically the chocworkorange a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor the butterscotch english toffee soooo good and lavender honey who doesnt love lavender  whats your favorite flavor","724":"reno is not known for its chinese food but that doesnt mean a diamond in the rough doesnt exist after scouring a dozen or so hole in the wall chinese shops i have finally found two local joints that i will call home to my china tooth aka chinese food craving    when i want a late night bite of generals chicken or honey garlic shrimp sf kitchen is my top choice the setting and decor isnt quite asian crawfish but that doesnt matter once your first bite is taken my wife and i love honey walnut shrimp and we will try anything that resembles that on any menu at sf kitchen you will not be disappointed with the honey garlic shrimp usually there is the issue of too much batter or sauce thats too sweet or too few shrimp or ect but alas this dish is quite perfect as i rant and rave about the shrimp dish the sezchuan beef was on point as well with that in mind i cant stop thinking about that shrimp dish   now that ive said my piece go out and try it you will find a new home for your china tooth too","726":"truly one of the places where your eyes are bigger than your stomach and even so you wish your stomach could double its capacity   the donuts here are imaginative and original i had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning   new orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while i didnt get a chance to try the one at winks in the french quarter i imagine the ones at district are a good representation its a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it generally im more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful i could have eaten a half dozen no sweat but there were other items to try   district has croquenuts available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich i chose the monte cristo for its sweet and savory combination gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut this was a magical creation get it if you have the chance  finally to top of my donut extravaganza i chose the miso olive oil praline bacon donut its a mouthful to say but wasnt to consume such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut i chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso olive oil and praline each hit their notes with every bite simply wonderful   not to forget was the the vietnamese iced coffee to wash it all down it was the jolt i needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts   you bet ill make another or several stops next time im in new orleans","727":"callys is in my opinion the best tea shop in edmonton the baked goods are superb and the teas are of excellent quality one of my favourites is the rose tea  it smells just like real rose petals and the taste comes through nicely in the brew  the atmosphere is perfect so all in all visiting callys results in an excellent tea experience","734":"incredible food the owner is so hospitable and ales everyone feel like family had the lamb gyro and the flavor was over the top loved their tzatziki sauce was delicious loved their greek salad as well definitely recommend to anyone wanting authentic greek food","736":"i cant wait to go back its unbelievably full of everything  anything you could possibly want from an italian market  you can eat there as well unfortunately it closes very early on saturday but we didnt know  were lucky to get inside before they locked it a lot of items were already in the process of being put away so we didnt buy very much couldnt even get bread or eat there i was starving so i grabbed some cheese  ate some  of course saved the package to pay for it        need a lot of time to meander around theres so much variety its sensory overload what we did buy was delicious","737":"we were heading out for brunch in the garden district and literally made the cabby pull over as soon as we saw this place  hey  sounds like a bunch of good things rolled into one  it was early so we didnt have the sliders but the donuts and coffee were exceptional  the donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first but i was wrong  they were actually well balanced with good flavors  they take coffee seriously too  i tried their cold nitro brew which seemed more like a guinness than an iced coffee  it wasnt exactly my style so switched it for a latte instead but i applaud them for trying to innovate","741":"our favorite little taco place we always get the steak chicken and fish tacos we looove the queso highly recommend","742":"this tour was great  the tour guide provided us with a wealth of knowledge not only about the food but about new orleans history and its culture i strongly recommend this to anyone","743":"my partner and i were out of towners for a wedding which took place at spassos it was such a good spot for a wedding dinner the space was open staff

fresh tortillas minimalistic decor","746":"first place i ate in the area and it was sooo good my friend and i both ordered pasta but the pizzas looked good from afar they have beer and wine available

back for sure","757":"this tour is highly recommended as a local they do give you a good taste of new orleans from gumbo to jambalaya to a muffaletta to a poboy very good tour this is my second tme taking it preston was an animated tour guide and very fun to be around","760":"so yummy  we were visiting friends and craving some ice cream so i looked on yelp and found this place we got a cookies and cream milkshake and a chocolate almond in a cone both were delicious and the staff was very friendly","766":"this is a hidden gem this is my first review but i had to give it 5 stars for the amazing crepes at a good price i also had a delicious caramel milkshake the crepes here are cheaper than the market and they dont come in a cone when i come back to new orleans ill be coming here  my mum and i really enjoyed it","767":"so something with this truck must have changed because i just went here for lunch and it was on point i got the bbq meatball sandwich the guy is definitely a joker and says whats on his mind but nothing was insulting meatballs were hot and had soft texture sandwich roll is fantastic hoping people give this place a go because id go back for sure","769":"by far the best brunch in tucson one of the rare places that serves a bloody mary with a beer back  service is consistently great expect a wait fridaysunday order the benedict and the madras mimosa","771":"schlafly bottleworks is more than just a microbrewery yes they do brew their own beer onsite tours are available and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating  they also have great affordable food im a big fan of their burgers but have never ordered anything at schlaflys that i didnt like they also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmers market during the summer on their parking lot  i appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free even the bar before the smoking ban went into place they keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle   ive also been to several events with the back room with its own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you like","772":"best pralines in town   they are generous with samples so go in there and try all the flavors original rum chocolate coconut etc   bring me some when you go seriously","774":"love the smells of chocolates here as you walk in the door  amazing and creative chocolate team here that can create just about anything out of chocolate icing nuts dried fruit  what we love   gourmet chocolate dipped pretzel rods mint meltaways dark and milk chocolate  chocolate covered orange peels bourbon chocolates   also a great place to find or special order your favorite candies    lastly ive got to mention  the treats they put together for special events and holidays","777":"we were looking for a dairy free ice cream place to take the kids bam gelato when we walked in my kids both instantly got super excited the display of gelato is beautiful very fancy lots of colors the menu also included lots of paninis and other little snacks and soups it would be a great place for lunch if youre looking for something quick but not fast food and greasy we had the vanilla and the strawberry kids size gelato for our first trip we will definitely be going back again it is a great stop for family walk time too we definitely recommend","779":"these donuts were amazing nothing negative i have to say about this place i was a little sad that they didnt have my strawberry donut i was looking forward to very much  i did get a bit of a hard time about wanting a chicken sandwich with a glazed donut being told they couldnt do that but hey i ended up with a chicken glazed donut sandwich which i really appreciated after being told they couldnt do the staff was very kind and i loved walking in back to use the restroom  seeing the huge deep fryer full of their freshly made donuts biting into one of their donuts was nice because theyre so freaking delicate they almost melt when you eat them the texture was amazing and the chicken was even a good quality i was very impressed  i will never look at krispy kreme the same","780":"foodie call always there when i turn around at a cool dive bar or my homebase for bama gamedays the burgers are always the  best my boyfriend and i like to split them just as a nice hearty snack just tell them to cut it in half if you are splitting a burger with someone ive had the 1 and its always amazing and we just had the jalapeo burger bc my bf loves spicy things and its his bday and omg this burger is also perfect im not surprised i probably wouldnt have been able to eat a whole one because its so deliciously spicy and i cant handle much spice but it was still extremely tasty like always","782":"little puzzled by some of the negative reviews i ordered the bbq sub this afternoon and it was pretty epic would definitely order again","783":"we had been driving around for some time on a weekday last week  this was our last time in town as we had sold our home in alton  so after going to 3 different restaurants and finding that they are closed for various reasons we decided we would come here  wow  seriously everything happens for a reason and wow   we were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening  the ambiance is lovely  we were greeted warmly initially and the warmness continued throughout our visit  as i said prior the ambiance is lovely the decor is so just want to take it home  the service was impeccable our waitress was attentive friendly knowledgeable and smiley  omg the food  the food  we had their summer special   holy cow were they fantastic  entrees were   seafood shrimp alfredo and our friend and i had the steak  honestly you cannot go wrong with anything that you order from tonys  top notch old school dining experience which is rare","786":"came to smileys after reading other yelp reviews and i was not disappointed i ordered the beef gyro platter to go and the portion was well worth the money myself and another person split the meal and there was still some left over the gyro meat is cut off of a huge slab right in front of you dont let its appearance put you off its delicious the rice is delicious and doesnt feel heavy or greasy like some that ive had from other establishments in the past with the platter you also get a huge helping of hummus and a bag full of delicious pita and a little salad on the side ill definitely be back here to try some of the other menu items i definitely need to try the baklava","788":"i never write reviews on yelp and this place was so good that i felt the need to login and write a review the poached pear donut was ridiculous this place is doing everything right","789":"this was our first experience eating lunch at cheddars our server was joey  we really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it rather than being prepared hours before  joey brought us coffee andmy test of an attentive serverkeep our coffee and water filled up  when we were low on coffee instead of warming up our coffee he brought new cups  this was typical of the excellent service      the food was superb  i had a mediumrare steak it was actually cooked mediumrare which does not always happen  the flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty      we plan to go back frequently  heartily recommended  the wait is noted in other reviews and its because of the quality of food  if you want to avoid a line go to a fast food place","790":"if you come tarpon springs and dont have meal at hellas thats gonna be a helluva good reason to come back to ts we had a gang of 11 of us that came here for the day away from st petersburg to chill out and feed our mugs my fellow yelpers thank you once again for leading us to the greenest pastures as i am now beginning to recite to myself  as i walk through the valley of hunger i shall fear no starvation for yelp thou art with me amen  we had to wait about a 12 hour to be seated as this place was hopping we got a table for 11 and were a bit cramped but no one was complaining we started of with the flaming cheese and fried smelts as the appetizer and they were amazing we all ordered the different dishes and there were empty plates at the end  i had the gyro sandwich and have yet to taste one as good we all ambled out of there and ready for a snooze in anticipation of more partying tonight we will definitely be back","791":"sooooo good  fav spot downtown classy intimate and more quiet than most dining places  drinks are phenomenal i recommend the margarita  they have a great dining room tons of booths  also they do rooftop dining   enjoy your

crunch when you bit into them  just amazing   for under 6 you can get two good size tacos and a drink its a great lunch value","804":"flat out amazing seafood everything was fresh pulled from the tanks in front of us small place but great food anybody visiting santa barbara should park in the pier and eat at this place ask your server for recommendations and try the local beer  hint park in the pier and use free valet if no spaces","805":"ok now were happy  excellent gelato many flavors  we are happy they were open til 10 pm on sunday cuz we showed up at 930  we ordered stracciatella and chocolate  cant wait to come again to try another","806":"saddest thing about leaving new orleans will be not going to il posto nearly every morning  this place has everything id want from my neighborhood cafe fit with the best coffee iced green tea with mint bagels caper berries and their homemade pumpkin chocolate chip delights  the best place to go to relax after a hard week with some food and coffee  do yourself a favor and get one of their homemade oreo cookies","809":"amazing alligator wings so delicious professional  guys work here high recommend","811":"this is my favorite brewery on brewerytown the beer is absolutely amazing and the menu is super unique the food is healthy but with enough flavor to make you feel like youre eating something complexity unhealthy its a small restaurant but once you find your little corner you wont want to leave sample each unique beer have a conversation with the amazing bartenders and youll feel like a local in no time","815":"i was fortunate to come across this lovely place as a sushi lover ive always been apprehensive about sushi burritos because it sounds like too much rice and not enough variety i was very wrong the sushi burrito is perfection it is the perfect lunch because its fresh and light the serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh   it is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like i would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture the tuna is definitely my favorite overall its an awesome lunch spot highly recommend","817":"we stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint   the service was friendly and prompt  we would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were great","818":"they have a surprisingly good ahi poke here made fresh every morning and if you want them to make a spicy ahi just call in the morning so they can make a spicy batch of tuna   they also have a great organic fruit and vegetable selection thatll keep me coming back here their staff is super friendly and always willing to help   they even have that cool amazon locker grocery system here im way too indecisive to order my groceries online but its a good think to keep in mind when wanting to shop here  i can see it coming in handy if you just need to grab groceries on a jiffy just pay in advanced and type in your locker code   their prices are very reasonable here for their quality of goods i would definitely recommend this grocery store","819":"i am totally infatuated with mod  their mod pizza salad is amazing  you pick and choose your own ingredients  walking distance from my place of employment super speedy service and the best lemonade i have ever had","821":"new favorite spot in reno best muscles ive had in a sushi joint great menu options that arent the same old rolls everywhere else has the flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet so be forewarned dont hesitate to check this place out great atmosphere and the best sushi","822":"my favorite place to get a hot chai in town they offer a selection of nondairy alternatives including my favorite almond milk they also offer 3 different types of chai  all brewed tea and not that sugary starbucks stuff if you go in the morning they have a wide variety of croissants quiche cinnamon rolls and other yummy stuff","824":"exceptional greek food authentic and well done greatly situated in the sponge docks of tarpon springs and they handled my party of 15 well our server nonda was very kind and most certainly very greek    the food was well done especially the classic greek salad pork souvlaki and gyro the seafood was great too the octopus was tender with a great char and the snapper was very flavorful my only regret was that i didnt have time for the bakery","825":"delicious pastries and coffee friendly  accommodating staff and open bright environment had the butterscotch bowtie it was big but so good i finished it all highly recommend","828":"yeah ill go 5 stars great little shop nice employees who dont roll their eyes when you ask for many many samples i only got 2 but i really just wanted to keep going   lots of great flavors and ideas going on here the salted caramel is just out of this world its haunting me right now it is a tad bit salty and should definitely not be eaten out of a pretzel cone but its so freaking good i got some peach bellini sorbet that was packed with flavor and so delightfully smooth   prices are pretty reasonable go here","829":"carrot cake was amazing crave it every day since i had it doesnt even compare to previous cakes ive had","830":"delicious red velvet cupcakes absolutely a mustgo if you are in the area definitely going to try to make the effort to stop by whenever im in philly   tried the banana pudding about 2 years ago too and it was fantastic surprisingly no wait its a small shop with great desserts","832":"i had no idea pudding could be this good i went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake or two but they were all out which turned out to be a boon because i probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise we were offered samples of banana pudding peanut butter pudding and strawberry banana pudding each as delicious as the last this stuff is like the hagendazs of pudding rich creamy and indulgent in fact its closer to eating custardy ice cream than any pudding youve ever had well definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gone","833":"i doubt that anyone even reads the reviews before going to this place it is so popular around town that everyone knows about it and there is no way to go wrong with it anytime i need any kind of delicious meat coffee or just want to grab a quick bite this is the place to go","834":"this is a local treasure we have lived in the area now for 20 years and every time the heat is on  this is the place to stop to cool down they serve a wide range of food and cooling treats that many flock to especially during the summer we go on a regular basis and will continue to as long as they are open ","839":"ive never seen a larger or better selection of beer in my life all are sold by the bottle and the prices are awesome the employees are always happy to help and greet you with a genuine smile little known this place also serves sandwiches paninis and wraps the different choices are sometimes exotic but alway delicious but if you know what you want you can always create your own any way you want it if youre on the run you can get anywhere from this location or just grab a table enjoy a beer or two with your sandwich and see whats up and coming in the local community i love this place","841":"we tried this place out because it was in the passport program we started out with a couple glasses of wine and a sauted calamari the calamari was nicely cooked and had a pretty good broth but could have used a little salt   our entrees were great though i had a lamb special which was incredible and my wifes pasta was also very good   a couple weird things 1 the space is a little small to the point where the servers are tripping over each other 2 the music choice was strange for an italian place mid90s country  i wasnt looking for dean martin or anything but it was an odd choice","844":"this tiny mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and spruce may not look like too much from the outside but once you step inside the experience is sure to blow you away ive been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences both times i visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu   my first bit of advice is if you havent been before and want to know what to order the answer is the cyprus breakfast this meal and it is quite filling has everything you could want for a brunch two extra crispy fried eggs a big slab of ham two pieces of a fried mediterranean cheese some delicious bread and a salad all together on one glorious plate my fianc and i both ordered each time we went because it is that good  this past trip i also ordered the lamb sandwich which was also amazing large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll  another menu item im dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special the way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach for dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko i know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala theyll know what you mean its a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom drizzled in orange infused syrup its outstanding   kanella is special because of more than just the food they have an amazing staff we had the same young waiter both times we went he was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu usually you dont remember the waiter and if you do its never for good reasons the service here actually enhances the experience on top of that there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating i saw the chef who i believe is also the owner leave the kitchen go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table honestly this was really touching to see   i couldnt recommend kanella more highly i will be back again soon","845":"the girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice treat you nicer than your family help you get what you like i also got a grilled cheese its nice to try the local delights   stevie nicks playing overhead   my grilled cheese is a work of art im already excited af the cheese was real not velveeta very very beautiful and comforting it came with sea salted potato chips  the ice tea was made fresh the taste is refreshing  exceedingly delish   free wifi too so you can yelp","848":"everything i have tried here has been

yum","855":"my sister and i were visiting arizona all the way from the east coast and our aunt and uncle brought us for breakfast today our server alma was out of this world she had an amazing positive and outgoing personality from the moment we sat down we felt at ease and comfortable her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome  we couldnt asked for a better and more upbeat personality  she definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her  we cant wait to visit again on top of this the food here is phenomenal","857":"tnt shrimp and the conch fritters

the future there are still a lot of things to try they only dont have espresso coffee","864":"let me be frank and say i am a universal schlafly fan i like the schlafly family their products each restaurant and their presence in the st louis community this review is based on several experiences   bottleworks great beer and a nice atmosphere you can bring your entire family a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot food is of great quality and nice quantity   waitstaff are some of the best in the city i have never ever been disappointed with a server manager buser or host one time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season my dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasnt able to find it anymore 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a minipint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty","868":"i love this place best sushi in tampa the staff is always friendly and dies a great job ive never had a bad experience here you can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table they have free wifi so you can make it a working meal  they do deliver which is another bonus  ive had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldnt figure out how our condo gate worked","869":"great bowls  sauce all of the ingredients were fresh and healthy service was great im going to become a regular at this place","871":"evething about this resturant is great 1 brew there own soy sauce 2 service amazing  3 food fresh creative  amazingly good 4 everything about this small south jersey resturant is the best around 5 can not wait to return","872":"clearly the word has been out about this breakfast spot for a long time and while we waited in line like everyone else does when they come here it moved surprisingly fast they offer up cups of coffee for those waiting outside and thankfully we had an unseasonably warm december morning  the prices are cheap the staff is pleasant and the pancakes well they were fantastic and im not much of a pancake guy their fried eggs and sausage patties were both enjoyable as well","875":"nothing has changed since my last review their donuts are still the best in town hands down theyve added delicious donut holes to their line if scrumptious products their breakfast and lunch sandwiches are made to order many choices to pick from if you havent been to tonys donuts youre missing the boat when you go tell george and john that i sent you ","876":"had a gyro plate was delicious bear hummus and gyro i have had in a long time  lebanese tea was perfect also","879":"yum yum yum salads pizza and sushi are all great i dont even love pizza but i love lulus olive oil athenian ","882":"i have been going to cyranos for close to 30 years  it has long been the place to take your datespouse for a late night desert  i have many great memories taking my girlfriend and later my wife for a intimateromantic rendezvous as their staff perform their cherries jubilee tableside  i have visited cyranos dozens of time and have never had a bad experience  the food is outstanding and their deserts are even better  the wait staff always seems friendly and helpful  every time i go it always seems the place is extremely busy a sign that they are doing something right after all these years  but i have never felt rushed they have always made me feel like i am their only customer  while i think they are known for their of the charts desserts their regular menu is outstanding as well  just thinking about the coffee rubbed tenderloin makes me drool  the chicken spiedini is another favorite  if you want something quick and lite they have a variety of soups and sandwiches as well   did i mention the cocktails well they are fabulous as well  the happy hour martinis are only 5  i hope to go for another 30 years","883":"well worth the wait my mother and i went on a monday morning around 9am the wait was about 20 minutes we thought we were going to have to wait for hours but we were pleasantly

sweet potato pancakes and pair them with the cinnamon cream out of this world","884":"an amazing and innovative new establishment we stopped in on a weekend trip from vegas good was excellent bone marrow was stellar and the brews were top notch the corn whiskey was excellent and the service was friendly with a touch of class we enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to enjoy more of its diverse menu and beer selection  most definitely worth a shot and reno is lucky to have this great option for food beer and whiskey connoisseurs","887":"looking for a break from regular ice cream

juicesmoothiesandwich bar daily sometimes twice daily except sunday because they arent open sad  i love their aliens nectar and green lantern juices  im addicted their acai bowls are out of this world delicious also when they make a smoothie with dates it ends up smooth versus the place across the street that cant seemml to make juice or smoothies that flow easily up straws  get the cocoanut smoothie with date butter  you wont be sorry fellow chocolate lovers or one if the pineapple coconut smoothies oh so good  the prices at this store are on par with other natural grocers staff is super

customize anything you order bathroom smells amazing lol","904":"we really enjoyed out dinner here my husband and i took our tween son for dinner his only experience with greek food was my moussaka in order to expand his horizons a bit we shared the sampler app and tour of greece entree  everything was seasoned perfectly and delicious the waiter was prompt and courteous while avoiding bothering us every few minutes  some of the portions are pricey for their size on the app but were plated nicely we will be going back  one note i noticed worry on other diners faces when they spotted a child across the room my son is used to people being surprised by his dining etiquette but i would not bring an ill mannered or unpredictable child along","905":"i go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city the food is fresh and theres a big variety they offer good coffee sandwiches breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more super convenient

and i joined our friends for a fantastic meal here the owners and staff were extremely friendly and provided excellent service we tried quite a few rolls and i definitely recommend the japican and blossom really delicious the nigiri and quail egg shooters were great and fresh too well have to try the coconut ice cream when we come back since they were out but the green tea flavor was a perfect way to conclude the sushi feast we had   we will definitely be back so glad this location opened up so close saving us the drive down to carson city","908":"so glad i finally listened to my boyfriend

incredibly genuine and sweet i fell outside the restaurant and was greeted with an entire first aid kit and staff constantly checking up on me food was amazing id suggest the tenderloin","911":"this place is amazing everything is sooo good and i have defiantly been here enough to say i have tried almost everything on the menu all the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control i have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area are yall serious its right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officeri think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time lets just start with the donuts they r amazing they have the best donuts around i love donuts so i have been to just about every donut shop in the nola area and these r the best  the donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want all u have to do is ask whenever i want special orders i call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon the apple fritters here are so good as well  red velvet cake and reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the oreo donut is just as good  next lets move on to kastleburgers these kastleburgers are a new orleans original and no one can top them these people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science  or so it appears i have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastees kastleburgers are so much better does anyone even go to crystal  also just like the donuts you can special order the kastleburgers they are always made  fresh the breakfast is so good as well they use real products it is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast u can order anything u can imagine for breakfast i have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and i have seen all different types of breakfast platters served they also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 247 now the hot plates they serve here are so good they have everything and its all home cooked u can taste it it reminds me of when i was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice they also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it  the gumbo is good as well all i can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full new orleans style donut experience this is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when i was a child its so nice to have a restaurant donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product this place is the best donut shop around","914":"we stopped at mr wizards tonight for the first time  we both wanted something cold and sweet but didnt want to risk standing in line at ted

texture of everything is meltinyourmouth  the sauces are amazing  keep up the good work","928":"this is hands down my favorite coffee spot i dont understand why the starbucks on broad ripple ave gets so much business because monon blows them out of the water delicious drinks a wide variety of coffees and tasty pastries make this a must see if youre in the neighborhood the honor bar is great for those times you just want some coffee and need to get in and out in a hurry","939":"the most friendly mom and pop coffee house ever  the coffee is perfect and strong the pastries are yummy and moist worth the drive for me","940":"the pancake pantry is a great place expect to wait in line for 5  1 hour but its worth it also if one is unable to stand for this amount of time bring something with you if you havent tried the pancake pantry these pancakes need to be in or around your mouth as soon as possible i recommend trying the hashbrowns  with your meal","942":"foreword my experience with the bottleworks is as an event venue  every year when the wustl department im in is trying to recruit new graduate students we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better  the two years ive taken part in this event have just been a blast  the schlafly event room in the back i forget the name of it but i think it has one is just a fun and unique place to have a private event  the view of the bottleworks is impressive and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great  i think the cost is pretty reasonable for us too which includes unlimited beerwine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors doeuvre  im a member of the group that helps put the event on this year and i definitely think were sticking with the bottleworks again  look forward to an updated review around february or march next year","943":"this was by far my favorite cuban sandwich of all the cubans ive had to date we were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert over all the experience was excellent  i cant wait to go there again","945":"been going to this place since i was a

allyoucaneat style its really awesome and i highly recommend it","948":"had dinner at baileys range last night 102711  my wife and i had the abc burger and the lamb burger and shared halvesthis was a flavor explosionary experience everything about both burgers was awesome the meat was delish the buns perfect toppings perfect  the beer selection is all st louis area beer except no abinbev products which isnt st louis area beer anymore is it the pickle was like the best pickle ive ever had and the ketchup was great too  they actually make the pickles and ketchup themselves  fries were quite good kindof a britishstyle chip you  know a little translucent  for soda lovers they have an amazing array of non cornsyrup selections ie cane sugar    rest assured i will be back for the wedge salad and the bison burger on another day","949":"ill keep it short and sweet oh my god im hilarious  imaginative concoctions friendly staff unlimited samples cant rave enough about the place  i know youre

great flavors make up for it in spades fries and rings were great too","964":"i had three dogs here because they are that good i had the daves style the western and the pizza dog the pizza dog is amazing i highly recommend daves dog","967":"this vietnamese restaurant was our last stop before heading home  we picked up a few sandwiches banh mi for 350 each  by the way its buy 5 get 1 free  to our pleasant surprise this place also serves some popular dishes such as bun bo hue spicy noodle soup pho beef stew bo kho etc  we ordered these dishes and they were authentic vietnamese   the place was spic and span including the bathroom  since we were there around 11am and probably were their first customers of the day we dont know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day  as for banh mi we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches as they were not going to be consumed right away  the folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when were ready to eat  nice touch  the meats for the sandwiches at seasons cafe and bakery were in good quantity which puts the banh mi shops in northern va to shame  the workers wore gloves when handling foods and their sanitation practices seem to be better than most typical vietnamese restaurants weve visited wish this restaurant was near us at home in northern va","968":"todays 1st time visit to ippolitos was fantastic i love the fresh selection of seafood i had the tuna cheesesteak and i very much enjoyed it but felt remorse for i had just finished coming from the gym but the sesame roll was undeniable josiah is awesome and we talked seafood for we were both fanatics and he hooked me up with a fresh complementary piece of fish which i promptly seasoned and baked as soon as i got home good job folks","973":"food is excellent and fresh everytime i go there the staff is friendly and the food is just so flavorful i have brought several people here for the first time and they all love it","974":"today was our first visit its a cool little place in a nice neighborhood thankfully they have their own parking lot but theres plenty of street parking too which is good because it was packed the inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating not that it mattered because it was so crowded but i cant fault them for that  the customer service was really good although the guy who took our order didnt seem to believe that i knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if i had ever had one before i badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what i wanted im just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about  that being said when i got it it was great obviously good quality espresso my husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasnt a fan of but i really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder he also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat and he loved that their to go cups are also really cute its out of the way but well definitely be back","979":"this place has great donuts and sliders kids wanted to come back the second day wish we could take some home but the fill up before we go will have to suffice","980":"i didnt even hesitate before giving this place 5 stars  new orleans is my husband and my favorite vacation city and we miss the food so much when we come home  someone suggested we try this place and its quickly becoming a favorite  heres what weve tried so far jambalaya awesome  great heat rice consistancy was perfect a peeve of mine  exactly how i like it  unfortunately the hubby isnt into jambalaya so we dont order it often   red beans and rice traditional  delicious brisket gumbo so tender smokey ridiculously good   muffaletta this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of nola  many places do their own variation but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish  i had heard that serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and i had to try it  spot on  love it love it cafe au lait mmmmm beignets this is the only thing id pass on  very good but made with cinnamon with isnt my thing  i always get take out and he packs everything for easy microwaving or reheating","982":"had brunch on a saturday food was delicious service was great great atmosphere will definitely put this place in my rotation of favorite spots","983":"this place is pretty amazing with a novel idea the pizza is great the choices are vast   only suggestion clean the walls they are covered in dust and lint look up","987":"tasting for our wedding cakes tasted 3 gluten free flavors  chocolate vanilla pina colada and 5 regular flavors was a nice tasting experience ill post another review after we have the wedding and get the cake","988":"let me start out by saying that i am a nut for good sushi out of probably 200 sushi bars i have been to there are only 9 places in the world that i have been to that meet my criteria to be called a good sushi bar three are in japan 2 are in los angeles 1 is in san francisco 2 are in new york and then theres this place in shtty old philadelphia a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in center city izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way any good food starts out with good ingredients making good traditional sushi is very simple use good quality rice prepared properly excellent fish and a dab of some good homemade wasabi most places suck at all or some of these things not this place small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the frontofhouse hardest working people in the restaurant industry those foh guys probably only 3035 seats but when the place is full they are running around like crazy serving food taking orders busing tables and seating new parties the wait can be long but it is worth it all of the fish i have had there virtually every fish on the menu has been perfect as sashimi and sushi and their maki rolls are good as well special shoutouts for the tuna salmon superwhite tuna dont eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues and the oh toro all are excellent in texture quality taste and preparation if you like spicy tuna rolls you wont eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon theres no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day   the good food doesnt stop at the sushi though their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ohmygoodness this is amazing  we first visited izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago and now find ourselves there once a week its that good","992":"this place is insane amazing selection of anything you could possibly want fresh coffee bar gelato pastries cheeses wines sliced meats fresh homemade pastas  sauces i could go on for a while you need to go here","993":"i have been going to the pantry for years and i have it down to a science for one thing here are the ground rules it is a hang over cure for the vanderbilt and belmont university set so weekends after 9am will be a bear to get in the line can stretch for hours and blocks but once you get in the service is fast and efficient   the cool factor is that i have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from vince gill or kevin costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare   now the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu i usually get a half order because i have a small appetite my favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world i also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top so you mix the half melted chocolate chips with the half melted butter and then you poor a little bit of syrup on the pancakes and its nothing short of a religious experience   the coffee is just ok","994":"everyone will agree that im a highly judgmental person usually on the negative side so when i come across something that is actually amazing i think its important to make note breaux mart has amazing king cakes ive had this response from both locals and tourists alike this location will make them for you out of season if you preorder  and they have all the basic staples that a new orleanian might need during a pilgrimage between msy airport and the french quarterdowntown ie blue runner red beans hubigs pies and community coffee my normal omg i need it list ","995":"im writing this review solely based on the fact that i am sitting here at 2 am on a sunday night craving sushiya mind you i graduated two years ago i just love their iv roll  miso soup so much its not your best quality sushi restaurant by any means but it is damn good","997":"this is the best vietnamese restaurant in town ive seen them saigon transition from a grocery store to restaurant their food is always amazing and you can never go wrong the service can be sometimes feisty but its all worth it if youre new to asian food you can never go wrong with the viet chicken pork etc grilled sandwich or the pho","999":"looking for the  best italian food and grocery this is the place to be  it could be very crowded on weekend  the full parking lot and hundreds of customers   inside the store proved that how popular this place is regardless of the big crowd the service was fast the employee were well trained and friendly  they were on the top of their game i love the prepared food area this time we got 2 mango tandoori chicken drumsticks a piece of italian stromboli  and couple piece of beef plus 2 root beer sum up around 10 we asked the food to be heated and it took less than 5 minutes we had a delicious picnic in the park afterward  this is the best italian market in my book i never got disappointed every time i came here","1000":"service was awesome food was delicious very busy place for brunch on weekends but the wait was well worth it","1002":"nothing i can say to convince anyone to go here its an institution the bread does not make it home unopened staff is great and selection amazing","1006":"my rating is based on the food  the service and decor are obviously lacking  go for lunch or late evening  the tasting menu is your best bet  ive gone three times  theyll send extras more of something you liked and youll get to sample items you wouldnt normally order","1007":"if you were in la the wait would be doubled if we were at home sfe nm the price would have been tripled bloody mary w a beer back and another one of their signature cocktails was only 12 the food was excellent creative and hardy a highlight of our trip to tucson for sure","1009":"service has been great both times ive been there i now crave the abc burger delicious save room for a boozy shake yum","1010":"food was good i had the weekly champion burger the vermont breakfast great the fries catsup and other sauces were good too beer selection was good but jessica was the best sit at the bar and have faith shell give you a great experience best service ive ever had in my life","1013":"phenomenal food excellent service and outstanding center city location make this restaurant a must visit and a top choice in a city already known for outstanding restaurants certainly one of my favorites","1014":"love this place love my mots  my tom hehe all these guys are super funny and they know their stuff","1015":"staff is so friendly and courteous made me feel wonderful about paying so much for donuts","1016":"tried the revamped menu the duck is very good pub and kitchen is always a solid choice","1018":"this place just seems like the disney world of cafe shops its fanciful and unique but crowded trying to navigate the deli bar was extremely frustrating but it was not for the workers some people just do not understand the concept of pulling numbers and then stepping out of the way to be polite however the workers behind the counter were poised and courteous despite the onslaught the great staff stood out in other areas as well in the wine room and the cheese room i was helped by two men who were eager to answer questions hold a conversation about their respective areas and make me feel great even though i had little knowledge i never felt rushed and i felt welltaken care of even though i was young and i definitely dont look rich  great place when i am back in town i will definitely keep going for the section of foods and service   deli food 45 great for how inexpensive and mass made it is nothing really made me excited but it all tasted good  gelato 45 small varieties but very tasty  cheese 55  theres so much cheese and the guy behind the counter really knows his stuff and will help you understand the differences between all those stinky rinds wine 55 good selection and multiple staff members seemed to know what they were talking about including the location and story of many wineries  market 55 tons of imported items and variety   bottom line its crowded but worth it probably best to skip lunch time on the weekends if you dont like crowds very helpful staff will be a repeat customer","1019":"2 for a drip coffee i had the corsica blend which is delicious 50 refills which is a nice deal if you plan on staying a bit to read or work my first time here and ill definitely be back great prices in rittenhouse for a good cup of joe staff was friendly line moved very fast highly recommended","1021":"this was so worth it  first what an awesome innovation  the miniscoop sampler  i can never decide what to get and this time i got to choose four flavors  i got the chocolate lavendar honey coffee butter pecan and the pumpkin cheesecake  the butter pecan was in a league of its own but closely followed by the honey  not only were these flavorful but all four were perfectly dense creaminess  its a good thing i dont leave near the place","1022":"this is simply the best asian food available in reno periodbest traditional chinese dish flavors  but if you dont like oily pan fried food tell them put less oil or much less oil  the reception lady remember my wife when we went back to order after almost a year we lived in daly city and we go there and eat there in reno at least once  theyre goodtake my word for it  if not well nothing i can do so there ","1026":"this is our  my husband and i favorite casual dining place the food is consistently good nothing fancy just fresh homemade food the friday fish fry is amazing better than any i have ever tasted there are several fish choices several chicken and beef choices as well if you are trying to cut back on calories there are delicious salads and soups the prices are very reasonable and the wait people and other workers are pleasant and efficient try it youll like it","1027":"decided to give this place a try on my lunch break and i have to sayim impressed its a little small but the decorations are pleasant l most importantly the sushi is very goodand you get a good amount   i will definitely be going back","1029":"for context ive previously always been somewhat to my embarrassment generally more fond of fancytrendy donuts dorite in chicago sidecar in la etc than your momandpop style donut always thought the highquality ingredients and inspired flavor combinations made the calories more worth it   st louis is an anomaly the hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment sorry strange your toppings are decent but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick sorry vincent van doughnutactually im not sorry  you should be sorry for selling me that chocolatecoffee abomination thats the first donut i ever left unfinished its literally sprinkled with coffee grounds it would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate  thankfully the anomaly works both ways this homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff for insanely low prices chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheapdonutchocolate blueberry cakes are light fresh and fruity  perfectly sweet buttermilks are rich and satisfying all worth coming back for but oh the apple fritters deep fried perfection  if there exists an apple fritter better than the ones here i will most definitely live off the things for the rest of my likely very short life","1031":"right around the corner from our house  this is our my husband and i go to for everything brunch a cocktail a late night snack a date night   we love pub and kitchen so much  such a cool vibe and such great people the food is the best too   love it","1033":"the gentleman in the truck was very nice

incredible great service and ambiance this has the feel of a restaurant in nyc if you are in downtown clw try this place outl","1042":"i love icesmile they are really new to the tampa area and they already have a huge following for around the same price as frozen yogurt you get to try thai style rolled ice cream this store is so trendy it feels like it should be in new york city they have a ton of different flavor and topping options they also offer discounts quite often the only suggestion i have is that they add more seating inside","1043":"i just received my doberge cake in the mail and must say it is the highlight of this birthday month i grew up in new orleans but now live in california there is no better cake on the planet it was a bit of a splurge to have one shipped to me but so worth it wow the memories it brought back it arrived in perfect condition and right on time theyve improved the shipping on these cakes i ordered one a few years ago and the frosting peeled off when i peeled off the plastic wrapping not any more it was just perfect this time  my other favorite splurge is getting the amazing king cakes at mardi gras time theyre the best i bring them to work and everyone flips out over them my daughters in college expect them now too they get the king cakes beads etc and have gotten lots of attention in the dorms because of them one daughter said that people will say they will just have a little sliver then they always come back for more the baby in the king cake is always a fun topic for californians to learn about   thanks for helping me to relive my childhood memories","1044":"i was seeking out phyllodelphia food truck and discovered this phenomenal place i am an average beer drinker but was with a friend with an exceptional beer iqand it passed her high standards the staff was informative and knowledgeable without being stuffy or snobby the fabulous mindy helped us discover what we both liked best we sampled some beers and know what we will have next time and there definitely will be many more times worth seeking out  finding","1046":"best breakfast in idaho the most delicious breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich but also the more traditional breakfasts like eggs benedict are fantastic elegant presentation and everything is made from scratch the charming old building is a fully renovated church cathedral the coffee bar is spot on too you would think its a dedicated coffee shop","1048":"great place for dinner had to wait bc it was the weekend but food was good  gator tail was delish walking distance from our hotel was great

the bomb honestly i tried almost everything on the menu and was not disappointed once except for the one time when i tried to order lunch and they could not place my order because they were extremely busy which is not a bad thing  the food is just this good","1061":"this is an awesome addition to the dessert options in nashville i love ice cream in a cone but this absolutely knocks that out of the park pun intended being next to centennial park  service the person working was a sweet older lady that was very patient and even let us try several flavors which was nice   food i had the monster blue dough with mms and peanut butter chips and the red velvet in a french vanilla cone with caramel talk about treating yourselfso rich delicious and heavy if im honest next time i will have to split two scoops in a cone as the portions are outrageously large not a bad thing  overall this place is a huge treat for your significant other or your kids i highly recommend trying nobaked at least once","1063":"good coffee super cute location and some of the best service anywhere i havent eaten there yet but im sure i will be back to try the food in the next few days the barista kayla i dont

something sweet and some locals recommended this place after a trolley ride and wandering around we finally made it the environment is really comfortable with pictures of patrons on the bright walls

in sylvan park for dinner  when we arrived the place was jam packed and we knew there would be quite the wait  i live right by local taco and frequent the place  food is always delicious along with the margaritas  the shrimp taco is my favorite along with the local bbq try it out   my friend got her food on a separate ticket and awhile went by and i still had not received mine  it took a little longer than usual but i figured it was because they were so slammed  a few minutes later the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table  she asked if i had gotten my food yet and i said no and she apologized and said shed be right back  then bryan haas im guessing he was the manager at the time came out with our food apologizing  long story short  i received awesome customer service from the local taco staff and bryan haas especially  they compd our food for the delay and gave a gift card to return as well    i told him the gift card wasnt necessary but he insisted bryan also slipped his business card in there which i thought was very professional and sincere    i just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the allstar staff

splurge    i love all the different flavors of fro yo that they have  every time i go there is something different and i can always find something that i want  i wish i could remember all the flavors ive had but its like every time i take a spoonful i black out from the heavenly taste of it    i like the fact that they tell you which ones are low fat and which ones are fat free  its definitely hard to resist not getting a mass quantity since the cups are so big but im getting better at the portion control  its just so easy    the punch cards are awesome and i love that they let the 3 of us who always go together always punch the same card all at a once  some places make you have a card per person and i hate that    im already a colts fan but i like to think that every trip to huddles is just another way to show my love to the team","1113":"oh my goodness the cannoli  just amazing  simply amazing  theres not much more to say than that","1115":"all the crepes ive tried are fantastic

short of fresh and delicious other items you cant go wrong with are the soft tofu seafood soup japchaealthough i prefer the hmart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same pricethe fried

rice kimchi japchae 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that i had no idea what it was cept it was incredible i think it was some type of deepfried flourtype ball of goodnessim still dreaming of that lunch not all items are always available there sometimes is a bit of a language barrier however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can  i always check in on this place when i shop  hmart to see if they have the spicy blue crab soup today i lucked out and they had some there was a woman who was buying like 10 qts of the stuff turns out she is taking back home to wisconsin to freeze it you know its special when folks come from out of state to buy it  some of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates but isnt that what korean food is supposed to be i love this place","1117":"not a vegan or a vegetarian but i love eating vegan food i was so excited to try this place out it is connected to v street which is right next door so im guessing this is the vegan paradise of philly two awesome restaurants right next to each other so what does that mean well if youre like me that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome takeout you just order from both places so you dont miss out we ordered takeout from v street then headed next door to wiz kid where i ordered the wk philly the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak we were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at wiz kid and eat our food there the wk philly was ready under 10 minutes and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies i loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options i went with the spicy and my mom had the regular we split the hoagie and were both blown away by the flavor this was the best cheese steak ive ever had the bun was so tasty the meat tasted like real meat but better because i didnt feel disgusting and overly full after i ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum the cheese was so flavorful too i honestly cant say enough about how good this sandwich was the service was great too i would come back here in a heart beat","1121":"i can honestly say beat place i can get a good cheesesteak and the bar next to it is a bonus could work on better staff and a better way of ordering but the please is the bomb food is beyond amazing","1125":"this place is always awesome their fried chicken is great and so is their fried fish its hard to decide what to get when you go but do yourself a favor and get the buffalo chicken sandwich on a bun at least once you could eat there if you wanted to but its

i ordered a ribeye and it was the best cut of meat ive ever had in my life cooked perfectly seasoned and oddly breaded which sounds unappealing until you taste it not only was it one of the best

spicy mayo dip on the side lettuce tomatoes served on 2double tortillas with rice  the wine menu is generic but i had a nice glass of santa barbara wine company chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic white zin  they do not have espresso or dessert but that was no big deal as the experience was perfect  good window views and seats at the bar it is small and i would anticipate on the

falafel king i know this is not pc and no offense is intended but it is an appropriate title to give him it doesnt just communicate how great the food is but the experience youll have   the standard

good as the ones i had ill be super pleased","1206":"whats not to like raw milk kefir yogurt plus farmfresh eggs and meat  a little expensive but youre paying for quality stuff not overprocessed

spot in philly luck smiled on my party of three as we snagged a lastminute reservation at noon you should plan further in advance than we did i echo other reviewers sentiments concerning the decor at kanella as i walked in the antique exposed brick and bluewhite color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the cycladic islands chef pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically mediterranean hospitality he checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned kanella a return visit on that merit alone  that isnt to downplay his cypriot fare the food is absolutely delicious one can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored and kanellas vibrant rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore ones faith in brunch we commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio which served up pumpkinfeta spicy tomato and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba each scored high marks from the table with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting brinyearthysweet interplay   other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg potatoes with tzatziki and a special lamb tongue stew though small in portion the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but eversoslightlycreamy fried egg crowning wellseasoned toothsome greens in yogurt sauce the potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards and paired beautifully with accompanying minty rich tzatziki the tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce with a squeeze of lemon juice a dollop of accompanying greek yogurt and a lastminute side order of extra grilled pita the dish served as a hearty memorable combination of flavors and textures  for a change of pace in the philly dining scene or simply for chef pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazygood

can just stop in and they have a number of cakes ready to customize for you  my only suggestion is adding glutenfree items or making them more visible they might also highlight lowercalorie items or a small section too buy hey this is a bakery ","1346":"this is a smallsize whole foods bigger than south street but tiny compared to cherry hill or marlton nj the staff however is always super nice best of the 3 others and they are good about special orders i love farmers markets and small local markets with great produce but this whole foods offers convenience and excellent quality fresh produce their new location is being built north and a block closer to fairmount so even closer for us yay","1348":"just the best sandwiches in tucson a good variety great menu and it is exciting to see the

here ive been coming here for almost my entire life and the food never ceases to amaze me","1351":"after searching for the best beignets in new orleans we finally found it at morning call   the beignets were absolute perfection  flaky poofy and beautifully golden brown  we asked our waitress what was special about theirs and she said that its the sourdough in the dough  she also said that they had just changed their frying oil which made them extra delicious im sure   and my husband said the cafe au lait was to die for as well   please dont waste your time going to the other beignet places unless what you really want is a crispy fried funnel cake no lie stop by morning call on your way in or out of new orleans and you wont be disappointed  open 247","1352":"my husband and i go to

those pancakes are what dreams are made of","1357":"the highest quality of cold or hot subs and italian paninis in st petersburg  the bread for the sub is made onsite high quality meats veggies and their own yummy coleslaw red pepper condiment  the subs are only 500  eating a sub without mayo or mustard is really refreshing  eat one here btw i really doubt you will be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting and you will never go to subway again unless someone else pays  you will be surprised about the weight of the sub that is packed with yummy things  if not having lunch there is a bakery with all of the goodies inexpensive coffee bar cheese and wine room fresh pasta deli olives etc  its a st pete landmark for a reason     visit on a nonsaturday if you like elbow room","1359":"what a great tour very informative  my family and i wasnt planning on going on the budweiser brewery tour but since we were in town we just had to go plus it was free im not much of a beer drinker but do drink every now and then but this tour was very interesting  our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the chicago cubs    as for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers my 3 year old daughter loved the tour so much was going on around her that she was distracted  of course she just had to have a stuff clydesdale in the gift shop   some people are on vacation or trip and dont have a sitter    great tour will do this again next time we are in town","1360":"this place is amazing my friends and i just happened to stumble upon it and we felt so lucky its delicious affordable fresh and authentic the people there even gave us a free extra dish just because they wanted us to try it we tried it and loved it","1362":"get their lavender latte with cocounut milk and an espresso shot guaranteed life changer","1364":"i hesitated to give 5 stars only because it is more of a take out place for me but for what it is it deserves 5 stars  this is not the sit down with a date kind of place although their dining area is clean and well kept  i think it is 5 star worthy for the quality of food you get for the price i make crab rangoon and because of that i usually dont like restaurants crab rangoon but theirs is excellent  their dishes are also very fresh and flavorful  my favorite is the roast pork in garlic sauce which they modify for me to not be hot ive never had a problem with the service they are always very friendly and fast highly recommend","1366":"the only bad thing is that they dont have a good ac system the place is very cool the food is excellent and the beer is cheap too i love coming here also if you want a focused buttoned up server who can answer your every question dont go here however if you want to be served by an authentic fun a bit spacey hipster this is the spot","1367":"amazing hidden gem this store is too little but have full of valuable things so much fun to check out all different kinds spices teas and snacks   and their coffee hazelnut coffee is amazing i drink a lot of coffee but i like to drink decaf it is really hard to find good decaf but i found one in philly their hazelnut coffee is so aromatic just brewing at home made you feel good i got like more than 10 packages so far and loving them   also got bunch of spices cumin wasabi powder paprika anise

better than ice cream and i swear that ted drewes custard must have opiates in it so insanely delicious go now","1374":"this is one of the best if not the best bbq places in the tampa bay area  seriously smoky and delicious meats especially the ribs and the brisket    we go here every now and then for the darn cheap brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and bring back a bunch for the office as well  that always gets us some brownie points   i hate to admit it but ive never gotten any sides here before  i dont even know if they have sides their meats are so good  and after all isnt the point of bbq the smoked meat    i know this is a bbq truck but its a heck of a lot cheaper than hungry harrys also great bbq but is of similar or slightly better flavor and quality    if you want to sit down to eat your bbq just bring it back to your car and take a lean on the hood as you enjoy your brisket with the traffic whirring by","1375":"great service awesome ice cream and water ice love going

area ive been here a few times and everything i have ordered has been made exactly how i thought it would be i feel that you cant go wrong with anything on the menu the fact they serve sticky rice with many of their dishes get an a for me   you can tell their food is made fresh and with  a lot of love it is a must try when in the st pete area","1379":"rick lewis is pretty much mark mcgwire the guy just keeps hitting home runs when he opens restaurants first southern and now grace meat  three by the way i do realize mcgwire took steroids but who didnt back then it was the thing to do in the 90s as was the macarena what a time to be alive  i met my brother here for a cheat day meal i couldnt think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the grove  in order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of bbq pork ribs  our four sides cornbread mac and cheese fried potatoes and greens  review hot chicken unlike lewis other hot chicken place southern this place only has one heat level its certainly spicy but not too spicy as expected the chicken was big juicy and crispy it got my nose running and eyes watering loved it its pretty much what youd get at southern from what i could tell thats good    bbq ribs not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent sweet glaze more than likely ill be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but thats 100 because the hot chicken is the mayor of flavor town  fried potatoes ours were fresh out of the oven very crispy thick and good seasoning  mac and cheese not bad could have been more cheesyeverything in the world could be more cheesy though in my opinion the crumble on top added a nice flavor  cornbread tasty not too sweet more bread than cornwhatever that meanswink wink  greens im not a greens guy but my brother liked it  conclusion paragraph i had high expectations going in especially since ive limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks a bad cheat meal would have  a sad scott however i was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food","1380":"my go to place in east nashville three suggestions  1 serve enough fries  2 offer pita with meals salads and soup 3 more chicken and orzo in the soup thanks","1381":"we had the salmon burger and beerbrined chicken every item was excellent and cooked to perfection a great improvement since i was here last years ago the herbed butter and sauces are amazing they also have mastered pickled vegetables as well something that enhances dishes that feature them even in an ancillary role   once again im tempted by the poutine but its 107 degrees today and although the ac is great it seems off to order it one day  by the way if its hot have the drink called the cooler it is worth it  our tall server gentleman with the green eyes was great","1384":"we took a tour at 2 pm and it was a great way to start the brew place is interesting on how they make all the manic happen with their amazing brews  i generally love the saisons but the sumo stout and abraxas stout were top notch and would drink more if didnt have to drive  stouts were so smooth flavorful  love this place","1385":"needed a last minute dinner choice last night great choice of craft beers fast and friendly service loved the burger this is a topnotch venue","1386":"just had chicken taco steak taco and chicken salad chicken was a little cold from sitting on the cool salad container the chicken was fresh and juicy the steak taco was delicious and had ample meat for the taco size the salad had a zesty lime based salad dressing which was delicious my regret is that

to be my new favorite chinese restaurant  extremely modern decor  very reasonable prices specially the lunch menu during the week  the food is great a modern twist on classic chinese food  i would definitely recommend if youre in the area i will be back myself","1392":"we went with the simple choice and were not disappointed eggs bacon and buttermilk pancakes i cant put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good but the pancakes were divine worth it in our opinion even saw a girl from the voice while dining here","1394":"what a great happy hour gotta be there","1396":"they are really great with making cakes last minute as i can attest to ive had a sampling of most of their cakes and theyre all delicious a little too sweet for my personal preference but thats not a bad flaw to have","1397":"i finally tried this place tonight it was very quiet which i love when i want to carry a conversation josh was our server what a great guy on the ball very informative no is not in hos vocabulary  got mussels marinara as an app  i have never seen so many mussels on 1 plate i swear it must have been 3 lbs and they were all as plump all of our food huge portions and delish dessert was over the top its my new fav italian restaurant cant wait to go back","1398":"one of the best coffee shops in town they have a variety of nondairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte i went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk it tasted amazing i topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee thank you for offering vegan options i will be back","1400":"what a happy mistake it was to randomly run into this place while exploring the garden district in new orleans the donuts were out of this world i cant believe they have new ones everyday i was with a group and we split a few so we could try a selection would definitely recommend stopping by","1404":"knockouts opened on super bowl sunday and i have been there twice so far to taste the fare the decor is that of a boxing ringgym it is very clean with a fair bit of room it is surrounded by a dozen or more tvs for watching multiple games playing at the same time their food is focused on standard barpub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods there is a second lounge area that is still under construction they intend to have karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar the new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area  on the first visit i ordered the bbq burger i forgotten the name it is under on the menu it is a 13 pound burger patty served with onion rings bbq sauce and i believe lettuce and tomato the burger stands pretty tall too tall for a human being to eat it however removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level the flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a bbq burger the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart i had a side of onion rings and they were excellent  my second visit was today and i only ordered an appetizer for lunch the stuffed deepfried mushrooms the site of the mushroom heads was about 2 across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried i think this diminished the whole stuffed aspect of the mushrooms as there didnt seem to be much stuffing in evidence the flavor of the mushrooms was excellent as was the texture of the mushroom flesh very firm and moist  they do have a pool table 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous touch tunes music system the staff is very friendly and i found the service to be prompt the food took a little time to get out but i suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks  im giving this 5 stars for a sports bar i cant think of anything id change in the place ill update the review once the new lounge opens and i have a chance to put the bartender through hisher paces with some classic cocktails","1406":"over my 68 years i have eaten a lot of pralines some delicious some not so much but i can say with absolute certainty that they make the best praline i have ever had they arent cheap but they are worth every penny im just glad i live 70 miles away or i would go there all too often","1407":"this place is

try","1412":"if good beer is what you seek look no further bier has got it going on and proudly has all their accolades displayed on the wall as they should the belgian dubbel won second at a world beer festival excuse me for not remembering the official name so you know its legit when they make it better than most belgians do  the staff is so friendly and willing to answer any and all questions about the beers brewing process and their business its family owned and they brew 150 different beers a year every week the tap list rotates and itll never be the same twice   they have trivia live music euchre tournament and other events throughout the week and unfortunately i didnt get to sample the food truck when i was there but ive heard its great if youre in indy bier is not to be missed","1419":"had lunch here for my birthday on october 7th and was not disappointed  it was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didnt have to wait that long to be seated there was seating both outside and inside but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier  my boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb maybe it was 6lbs lolz crab to share that was the special of the day but out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on  once our food arrived we dug right in everything tasted so delicious and fresh we finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind the shrimp salad was surprisingly good it was light and the shrimps were juicy the crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter   i definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth","1422":"take someone with you when

the service is also five stars smiley and mrs smiley go out of their way to make sure you are charmed and satisfied whether thats sending over free baklava or extra smoothies so that everyone can have

friendly and extremely well trained the coffee is so consistently good and fresh no matter what you buy or who makes it for you and the atmosphere is comfortable and esthetically pleasing i love it here and am a customer for life","1454":"be patient the ownerchefcook whatever you want to call him hes unqiue talks a lot and can be difficult to understand but you can see he simply loves to cook he doesnt skimp nor cheat you he asks whatever you can pay for and gives you more the food is great but its his love of customers  food that drives this business","1455":"the coffee ice cream is a musttry the flavor is great not too sweet not too rich it is just right","1459":"i give this an overall five stars for the entire experience  i visited my sister in la and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin to santa barbara for the weekend    the shellfish company sits on the end of the sterns warf which is one of the longest deepwater pier between los angeles and san francisco  from the outside you can see the tanks of fresh abalone dungeness crab and the infamous spider crab  you must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit  the inside is a classic you are here for the food not the ambiance  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating be careful it can get windy my sister and i sat at the bar  the bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some   we however were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staffbartenders who were really awesome enjoying life kinda people  they tipped it to the official 5 star review   we started with the abalone for an appetizer which was really good perfectly seasoned and cooked i also had to try the chowder  awesome but maines is better   they have a decent array of beers on tap and i chose a local brew  for dinner we split the spider crab cause we aint scared of shh ok maybe i was a littleit was huge  the dinner combo i believe came with choice of soup or salad  splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people i recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood  my one critique is that i thought the spider crab was over cooked  it by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but i know my seafood   overall one of the best experiences ever  if you go to santa barbra you must go here","1461":"wow a client recommended this place to me like a million other new yorkers our move to tampa has not found great food this place is the real deal if i could give ten stars i would deli coffee bakery homemade pasta everything you need and even what you dont this will be on my monthly shopping list for sure treat yourself  ps the meatball parm sub was amazing well worth the drive from tampa","1462":"finally the brick and mortar version of spot has arrived  inventive burgers the freshest ingredients and a lively family friendly atmosphere get there during the off peak times if you want to be ensured a seat this place fills up fast  looking forward to eating my way through the burgers then the other hot specialty sandwiches    still sniffing the fat and juices on my fingers long after the burger is gone sad to have to wash my hands","1464":"visited mangia for the first time today with my girlfriend what a pleasant experience great drinks amazing food and friendly service would highly recommend glad

the go to be able to grab a quick healthy snack its always clean and the staff is always friendly sometimes the flavors arent my favorite but i love being creative so i find a way to make it work for what my mood is that day love this place","1476":"my fivestar review has a lot to do with the fact that mr wizards is about a quarter of a mile from my house which means we can walk there thus burning off about 110 of the calories we are about to consume another reviewer called the location dogtownish but it is actually richmond heightsish meaning that it is really truly in richmond heights it is right off of 64 on big bend so if youre cruising through town hop off and try it also if you are dining at any of the maplewood establishments on manchester mr wizards is a pretty easy walk from there   now to the good stuff i cant vouch for all menu offerings because my goto is a concrete with butterscotch and pecans delicious my bf likes the malts  i cant settle the mr wizards v ted drewes argument because i am new to town but it is very hard to imagine that drewes serves anything better","1482":"price of jim beam 18 best i found in french quarter great service great family business 6 smokes and they deliver gonna hit them up every time im down here","1483":"i love coming here especially today my husband and i love coming here and sampling the fine donuts and sliders today we got some donuts to go because it is so hard to pick just one or two we got them home and the box collapsed in the middle and it was all bad for the tasty goodness that was our donuts if you have ever had their donuts you know how sad this event was so we went back to go buy replacements for our fallen donuts and we told the amazing staff what occurred they not only gave us the donuts we ordered but gave us one on the house to replace the fallen donuts not only is the food amazing but the staff is too thank you for reinforcing my love of district donuts","1485":"oki went on the tour to get some free beers however i never get tired of seeing the clydesdales the bottling plant and just how clean and organized everything is at the brewery if mickey mouse could drink hed hang out at this place because its a lot like disneys prim and proper order  the staff is always friendly and well rehearsed they know their beer facts which leaves me with one more point the hospitality room order up two fresh beers on tap munch on some pretzels and kick back for about 20 minutes ahh","1486":"one of the best food trucks in philadelphia  this is coming from a person that doesnt like trying to things extremely picky and not very daring everything on their menu is so good and filling my favorites are veggie burger wrap which is 5 instead of veggie burger itll be in a tortilla but somehow 10x better and chicken satay tacos 2 for 7 their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too   beware of the long lines though try to avoid going anytime from 11451230 if you do expect a long wait and no you cannot call ahead and order if youre a drexel student go in between class guaranteed no line   cash only","1490":"first time venturing out to brewerytown   anyways the burgers were so good you can get them medium rare or to other likings the buns were that soft potato roll quality like shake shacks the size is bigger thicker than shake shack but smallerthinner than regular steakhouse burgers  what made the burgers so good were flavors  i got umami burger which has sauce based on korean ssamjang misochili pepper paste and topped with mushrooms and shredded lettucecucumber i wasnt sure how the sauce will play with the burger but boy did that combo work lk the name lot of umami from the sauce with a nice refreshing balance from the veggies ive never had a burger taste like this before  bf got butcher burger which had onion tomato and horseradish sauce the sauce in there was also awesome giving the greasy burg an extra kick   service was quick and friendly not a lot of space for a large group though   oh and its byob we picked up some beer from rybrew across the street while waiting for the burgers there seem to be other cool new spots around here like crime and punishment brewery and aforementioned rybrew which is somewhat like foodery","1491":"legitimately 50 cheaper than stores on canal street bought sazerac rye herbsaint and a large bottle of peychauds for 56 versus the 97

those things online or in specialty shops in new york city   now you know","1492":"delicious healthy homecooked style food highly recommended","1493":"excelente la comida  las costillas ribs fueron

sight of the city the location where youve formally arrived in philly and though i love that station eversomuch when it comes to ambiance within for a snack or a sip the pickins are a little slim enter the rotisserie a permanent food truck offering at 30th sts the porch open for lunch 7 days a week from 11am2pm and wednesday through saturday from 49pm serving drinks from a beverage trailer those hours too rotisseries vibe is bright light and colorful most of the eats come from a 7 spit rotisserie oven and for me the highlights included the spit roasted veggies the fish tacos which were awesome great salsa verde and the lamb flatbread  unfortunately the porchetta i was looking forward to the most was not my favorite but the spicy mayo and the pickled vegetables as well as the saucy wings and things more than made up for even the momentary disappointment from the porchetta their booze options from great canned and draft beer options to the lazy lemonade a refreshing rum beverage that totally started the weekend off right are affordable and the colorful seats and umbrellas and the playful lighting made sure that id be back again soon regardless of whether im catching a train or not","1499":"outstanding most of their stuff is 110 calories per serving  that is not a lot compared to ice cream yet the taste and texture are amazing","1500":"very good pizza the owner is

bloomington so we decided to go to this location instead of castleton we were sort of dreading going on a saturday afternoon thinking it would be a madhouse from the parking lot to the check out line

at check out clean   i have been to costco locations from california to indiana and this is my new goto location have been visiting the costco in castleton but this location is so much nicer only wish that there was a trader joes nearby  another cool thing this location has so much more indian food than any other costco i have been to i assume its due to a larger population of indian people in the area   we asked the cashier why it was so mellow there and she said i think its because we are so new but honestly i would think that would be a reason for them to be crazy busy there regardless of the reason it was the best costco experience i have ever had","1524":"this is my favorite coffee shop love the atmosphere and the coffee and food are excellent if you go for breakfast  you have to try

where you can drink beer all night have breakfast in or drink hot tea in the afternoon whatever it is its got pretty great stuff they have some beer flavors off the tap that ive never heard of before like strawberry shortcake lager which was what i tried it was good smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them i also had a taste of their pear cider which you can also get off tap and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat and with the ciders you wont feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldnt really know if youre

time  indeed it was  she then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day  my husband and i both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best my winner was midnight rambler a dark fullbodied belgian stout mmmmm mmmmm good  to pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind i am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus it also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart acidity to it i am drooling right now just thinking about it   our experience at perennial could not have been any better the beer the food the service all five star worthy oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from memphis to try the place very cool   got some great tips to use for our future home brews  this place is a winner and we cant wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their

friendly and attentive my sandwich meatball was served promptly and was very fresh and hot the wheat bread was awesome they have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors the variety of subs leans to the healthy side they have only white and wheat bread there is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs but mostly they are pretty standard more like subway than

  fresh sweet and addictive are the best three words to describe my cannolis experience the filling comes in three different flavours chocolate vanilla and ricotta with chocolate chips i tried the ricotta and chocolate chips one and i cant even describe how heavenly it was   on the other hand i tried their claires naah not that good and i definitely had better ones in several other places but hey its an italian shop didnt expect them to make great french pastry anyways  i live in va but id drive all the way back to philly for those cannolis  bottom line this place gets 5 stars from me

greeted warmly we ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken with rice and beans and plantains and the food was all excellent if youre looking for a new food experience try jiallos","1715":"old world coffee where to start  i dont drink coffee very much okay i dont drink coffee at all my drink of preference would be hot cocoa occasionally spiced i never doubt the quality of the drink here because the milk is really quite good also some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art dont know what that is you should ask one of them theyre all very experienced with what theyre talking about thats another great reason to come here  not only is there quality of service but theres also friendliness the baristas are always very kind helpful and informative about what it is they do   not only is everything about the service great the atmosphere is really cool too i often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique and they change it out about once a month the wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing as well as nicely calming   this is definitely one of my favorite places to go","1718":"the dark chocolate sorbetto is an absolute miracle i dont know how something so creamy can possibly be dairyfree it is handsdown the best dark chocolate sorbet ive ever had top it with their todiefor peanut butter sauce and well deliciousness overload   ive also had the gelato and its always really good the hubs particularly likes the chocolate hazelnut gelato the cookies are also very good especially the ricotta cookies and the employees

their own gluten free crust my daughter says its among the best the only thing is they dont have dairyfree cheese available but the pizza chef said we can bring our own and they will put it on for us

highly recommend even if you dont need a large order just go get a cupcake you will dream about it for months wanting more","1740":"good food fresh and you can taste the quality good service as well went here at 730 on a saturday night and walked right in was pretty dead but probably because theres so much going on in the city state fair symphony on the prairie etc had the charleston blt which is a crab cake blt crabcake was huge all meat and tasted house made spinach and artichoke dip was good as well easy parking","1742":"great coffee and atmosphere right off of kennedy love the smells inside their cold brew coffee is strong and unique and their coffee that they market all over the tampa bay area is on the stronger side but for an experienced coffee drinker theres nothing better parking sucks at this location but if you can find a spot its well worth the trouble support local businesss","1744":"these guys are great  the coffee is delicious the vibe is relaxed yet well put together and the staff is friendly but not overbearing  go by  its a a cool spot","1746":"was not expected much until we arrived the it was packed outside not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient the custard was great i did not think it was overly sweet and some what light i had the tiramisu with pistachio and that was good kind of their version of it but none the less great would definitely go back when i am in town","1748":"mazzaros market is fat kid heaven  when you walk inside through the arch you begin to smell the baked goods and coffees being made  i immediately dart towards the cookies and pitzelles grab a cannoli then make my way over to the fresh pastas being made if i could afford to live inside here i would but then i would eat everything and they would have to roll me out the door hands down this is the best italian market to get all your needs for a nice sunday dinner","1751":"i really have loved the experience every time i go into body fuel the staff are always welcoming and full of advice its truly a great environment the acai bowls are top notch","1753":"great place if you are a carnivoreand if youre not try the sides  ive had everything off of this menu and its all delicious  pulled pork bbq chicken sandwichrack of ribs corn salad mac and cheese baked beansjust writing this is making me hungry  its so awesome to have something this good and this authentic in the hood  not expensive either  informal but cozy","1754":"i had a little happy hour dinner here with my girls after work great location right down the street from rosalitas i arrived early and got a table for the four of us our waitress was awesome very welcoming and knowledgeable i started off with the red pepper and gouda soup just as wonderful as it sounds plenty of substance not overly cheesy  very filling for a soup everyone else got one of the signature martinis everyone loved them except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it no problem they have small plates there which arent my thing but the one person in my party who got one liked it  there was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious at the end we each got desserts   this is definitely a dessert bar the portions were huge i seriously thought they brought me two i ordered a blondie and received a large brownie and a nice portion of ice cream i was in heaven just as delicious as it looked   great service great food great dessert all i need   on another note i love that they had several areas a bar an area with tables by the window and two sections with more personal seating sofas and comfy chairs in the back really something for everyone except for people expecting big burgers","1755":"lets stop it with the shenanigans people this place is the cream de la crem yes that was intended after scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state i stumbled upon a good cup of coffee delicious red eyes coffee an eclectic tea collection and i dont say this lightly the best croissant in the 805   first a little about moi i am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from paris to brussels to omaha and i know a thing or two about frances favorite breakfast good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft fresh delectable middle peets coffee and starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the french press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough the only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is dangelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down   while it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than starbucks open past 10pm on most nights if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in you will be greated by an always friendly customer service team a low key and relaxing ambiance great beverages and the best damn pastries and gelato around","1756":"what they did with this building is inspiring not to mention the unique food selection and also the regular bar favorites always great service love the depot","1759":"best frozen custard ive ever had i got the muni mocha and tried the cookie dough concretes both were delicious but maybe would have failed the inversion test great service and inexpensive","1767":"sushi for 2 really more like sushi for 3 great service incredibly fresh fish comfortable environment","1771":"best pies ive ever had  we buy a pie for every major family meal so ive tried nearly theyre entire selection the dutch apple pie and the sugar pie are my favorites  always nice to support a small business that makes a superior product","1772":"so this is a delayed review because i forgot the name of this place but figured it out via google street view  i came here the day after the final day of the bar exam  i was drained in every conceivable way and had a hangover thanks ac that could only be cured with the best most gluttonous diner breakfast    everything my gf and i ordered was great  i got basically every breakfast item on the menu pancakes eggs hash browns bacon toast sausage and she got the cheesesteak  including a basket of great onion rings to start and 20 tip it was only about 30 which is what im used to paying per head for a weekend brunch  im crafting an excuse to travel over the bridge just to get some great homestyle diner food","1773":"nice merchandising in the lobby  fantastic breakfast for the morning after brewery crawls   they had trouble with the taps when we went but made up for it in heavy pours   the beer selection makes flights a little hard to choose from so go more than once to work through the brews you wont be sorry","1774":"i have had the sundae pudding which is a banana bread pudding with walnuts it is so amazing my partner got the no nana pudding which is vanilla pudding it was good but the bananas and walnuts make it better i also got the walnut brownies which were really good too next time i will try the cupcakes they look perfect","1779":"i was in town for a minifamily reunion  the desk clerk at the hampton inn recommended this restaurant  it was great  we did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table  but that is because it is so perfect everyone wants to eat there and never leave  the staff encourages this relaxed feeling we never felt pressure to eat and run  instead they offered frequent topoffs for our coffee and water   dana our server patiently explained the specials a few times over cause we couldnt make up our minds  she made sure that the decaf crowd and nondecaf crowd were served correctly  also she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items  she was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy   the food choices fit everyones needs savory or sweet veggie or not  interesting combinations of old and new  i had the mac egg whites veggie sausage spinach etc  it was very tasty and filling  also appetizingly presented on the plate   others in my party had variations of french toast and omelets  tasted the french toast and was in heaven  all food arrived promptly and at once  a request to cook a dish a little bit more was handled with ease  if i had more room i would have had one of the pastries which looked delicious thanks to all at the prep  pastry for making our family feel very specially treated and welcome","1781":"i had been wanting to try this place for a while as it was really close to my internship its a cute tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling the crowd when i walked in was mixed it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom  her child enjoying breakfast a couple others came in and out while i was ordering as well   i was really impressed with the beautifully crafted lucky goat latte i ordereddark chocolate hazelnut sea salt it was delicious the barista was also patient and nice as i looked over what to order i would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries im also curious about the iced coffee  one suggestion id have is for them to update their website the website still lists fall specials and i know they have a couple of new drink specials every season ill be back soon to try more items off the menu","1786":"what is not to love about ted drewes   it was the first place my husband brought me on a pre marriage trip to saint louis  we ended up going four times in one weekend  the only thing that would make it better is if it was calorie free","1787":"favorite caffe from now on green apple ade plus banana walnut honey bread wow out of this world omg the smell of the banana cake is wow and did you see the packages presentation","1788":"i was looking for sushi and was very intrigued with the 5 stars on yelp that i had to check it out omg i wasnt dissappointed from appetizers to desserts it was do good for 2 people i recommend just getting 1 of each appetizers to share the long rolls are 10 pcs if they are not busy ask for half rolls in order to try other samples the desserts were great too although it would have been better to use sticky or sweet rice instead of sushi rice overall another great recommendation from my fellow yelpers","1791":"great local craft brewery in mercer county and is certainly much larger compared to their original lambertville location the new venue is clean organized and very much resembles the layout of allagash brewery in portland maine for anyone that has been to that one rh is expanding at an alarming rate due to the great quality of their beers especially their summer blonde which is extremely refreshing their beers are all unfiltered as opposed to other local craft breweries such as yards and flying fish were are filtered in order to sample you must take the tour because of new jersey law be sure to make a reservation and do not drink too much because ewing pd is literally next to the brewery","1795":"excellent little old school bakery maybe the best coffee cake aka crumble cake ive ever hadwell worth the 6 served at least 6 people","1796":"amazing service  food menu and people  bacon pastry has no rival  simply amazing","1798":"i hear good and bad about this venue but the fact is that i love that we have a real concert house in town that affords us the ability to see a level of entertainment that normally wouldnt be stopping in reno i dont know as much about sound as some of the others around here but when i go to a show i like to hear and feel it and i always get both at the knit from the first show i saw there the roots and the last one i made it to awolnation i am always satisfied when i leave","1800":"what a great shop  i have been there several times and i only have good things to say about it  the store is family owned and all of the family members that work there are very friendly and knowledgeable about their product ask them anything  the selection of spices is huge i have browsed there for over and hour looking at all of their items just to give you an idea they have dozens of different salts and peppers alone lots of fun and unique items as well like spicy mayan chocolate great for brownies with a kick and rose water  i love the freezedried corn that they sell try it","1801":"five stars because it is a casino they have lots of slots everything from a nickel and up i play the unicorn slot machine because it reminds me of the unicorns my favorite band i usually walk away with the same amount of  i spent i make enough to buy a round of drinks  brittney mullen is the best cocktail waitress she is the fastest and nicest cocktail waitress ever request her many times","1803":"fantastic my favorite way to start a vacation in a new city bring cash because you will want to tip the guide well by the end","1804":"i love their atmosphere and there are plenty of outlets  a little secret that most people dont realize there is an outlet outside in each lower corner of the two windows outside on the patio  i have tourettes syndrome and my uncontrollable tic is a cough  its not a real cough its tic like people who twitch but people think im sick  the baristas were very understanding and ive only had one issue with a customer i cant say im too fond that its no name coffee that sits in an airpot til its gone which could be a half hour or could me 3 hours unlikely tho but its really good   i would highly recommend this coffee shop  i love it","1809":"the ricotta cheese is key the super picky hubby loved the bbq chicken pizza and said everything was cooked to perfection no one flavor overpowering the other everything was perfect it was definitely worth the 30minute drive oneway to pick it up ordering and paying online made it super convenient and the pizzas were ready when we got there","1813":"my favorite starbucks the employees are excellent and learn the regulars however the parking kind of stinks but thats not their fault","1815":"for an old fashioned restaurant this place is truly ahead of its time highly recommend plenty of other reviews and pics of this place that

the new location with this jimmy johns  it is clean the associates are very friendly greeting me on the way in and on the way out and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat  i am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of i465 and by many work places  my only regreti forgot to get a pickle","1819":"ive been here3 times now its great we had the same server the first two times and she was amazing i was a little disappointed the third time when we had another server but she was just as amazing its really tough to find a place with consistency

waiting for a seat each time we left","1824":"very kind people i came in looking for some ginger tea due to some nausea i was experiencing the attendant there immediately took sympathy on me and made

were at chaifetz arena for a concert on saturday night and were hoping to find somewhere to eat in walking distance so that we didnt have to drive and hunt it was 11pm so the first place we tried had already closed their kitchen we then decided to try the fountain we were pleasantly surprised to be cheerily welcomed in and told the kitchen was open and not only was the kitchen open but the menu options were great as a vegetarian i was pleasantly suprised to find multiple options i went with a veggie hummus sandwich on a unique and delicious bread they had several unique and healthy side options as well after a fairly healthy meal we decided we could treat ourselves to the chocolate banana malt and it was fantastic i am very glad we found the fountain in addition to the great menu the decor is really cool and the staff was wonderful","1836":"wow what an incredible place the food is fabulous and the staff friendly friday night there are extended hours with a bistro menu and drink specials seating is inside or outside and there is a wonderful bakery next door so you can get fresh baked goods to bring home after i will be going back","1837":"at long last i dont have to drive to the southside of tucson for authentic mexican food great service decent menu   definitely worth a visit","1841":"this is a great beer distributor prices are very reasonable they dont overcharge you as the distributors in philly i actually pay 1000 less for a case of beer than what ive paid at the beer distributor in my neighborhood i havent gone anywhere else since they opened","1842":"i lived here

goods are amazing  especially the brownies never had better brownies than theirs theyve got a lot of the southern classics here like cocacola cake and chess pie my boyfriend loves the ham salad which i didnt even know existed before we started coming here  theyve got an excellent produce section with decent prices and racks of brand name breadsrolls marked down to 79 cents that arent even close to dayold theyve got a lunch counter that has a great menu the people that run the place are really nice forget about whole foods and harris teeter give this place a chance  it really deserves it","1845":"we walked here from napoleon and st charles after dinner one night the crowd was light and the staff was very friendly we had a scoop of creole cream cheese and a scoop of red velvetit was amazing the thai basil coconut was also really delicious and really refreshing this place is greati look forward to visiting on our next trip","1846":"im still a bit in awe of the experience my wife and i had at livery yesterday evening and am trying to think through how to succinctly cover everything i want to share  but simply put it was incredible  context it was our golden anniversary last night 6 years on the 6th we had just briefly met exec chef casey frank at an event this last thursday and decided to celebrate at livery as wed been meaning to stop by for awhile now it seems he must have 1 seen us come in 2 recognized who we were from the event and 3 remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night  because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees the server came back out and informed us we should forget about your order and wait for the experience chef had lined up for us  what followed was an astounding 8course small plate journey with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles weve encountered in indianapolis chef casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time we felt like nothing short of royalty at 630pm on a sunday   food ill highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel  sweet plantains were culinary genius sweetness of the plantain saltiness of black bean puree spice from the habanero guajillo sauce and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced the combinations were so complex but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish  pork tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor slight char on the outside gave it smoke which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce  scallop was the most wellprepared ive had in a long time perfect goldenbrown sear on the outside and so tender with not one bite of grit a feat that in my book is quite an accomplishment served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine churros were a playful and wellexecuted nod to latin street fare crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made inhouse   service our server tommy was a delight from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast friendly knowledgeable and attentive he engaged my wife and i just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order while giving us privacy to enjoy each others company we very much enjoyed his service  i honestly dont know what we did to deserve such a gift but sincere and heartfelt thanks  to chef casey tommy and livery  for making our golden anniversary so very special my only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite we will certainly be coming back and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an indy restaurant","1847":"authentic food great flavored great staff great portions the lamb riblets were cooked to perfection in olive oil and lemon juice of course easily the best lamb ive had anywhereincluding astoria ny the saganaki horta skordalia horiatiki greek saladdessert it was all top notch whether you are greek or not dont miss hellas you wont be disappointed","1848":"great place to grab a light snack like a specialty donut or slider or hangout and chat over a coffee  they do not serve alcohol however you can purchase a beer next door at steins deli and bring it over i had  chunky monkey donut cheeseburger slider fried chicken slider the snacks were all very well prepared and tasty  the cheeseburger was surprisingly juicy and the chicken slider had a nice jalapeo kick  would definitely recommend for a fast casual experience","1850":"great surprise below we drove home to san diego we bought another pizza to eat the next day at home great fresh toppings our favorite pizza place as of right now","1855":"never disappointed at maynards outstanding arizona wines the celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers as main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively the fish was exquisitely prepared leaving its inherent flavor come through not smothering it in sides to top it off an outstanding peach budino attentive prompt service great experience","1856":"great little wine bar with an excellent patio for enjoying live music came to see casey reeves play music here and really enjoyed it nice wine selection plenty of beer and spirits as well no food but a casual italian place shares the patio several other solid food options within walking distance bob has a nice place in a fun part of this small towns downtown keep up the good work","1858":"an upscale mexican joint really i enjoy good authentic mexican food this is by far the most upscale ive seen  im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type so this was different than what im used to   the atmosphere at besito is tough to beat they have merengue  salsa on the background which doesnt really go with the mexican theme but whos paying attention an ideal date night atmosphere for sure   food here is fantastic a little pricey but you get your moneys worth you have the 3 valet outside great service waiters have always been friendly and happy to discuss the menu besito more than met our expectations   if you love mexican food and feel like taking it to another level for once besito is your place its a gourmet mexican restaurant certainly worth trying","1863":"came across this place with my friends visiting reno we were not disappointed what so ever we walked in around 900 and were seating immediately the server megan  was really fast and nice the breakfast menu has a great variety they have vegan and gluten free options if you prefer i order the french toast with a side order of their chicken sausage the portion size was larger than i expected and very affordable i think my plate was around 810 because i added the sausages the french toast is probably the best french toast that i have ever tasted so if you love french toast you will defiantly not be disappointed","1865":"i would give them 6 stars if i could we had a fantastic time at this restaurant we used the yelp skip the line option which out us ahead of a lot of other people who probably did a walkin we were seated less than 15 minutes after our yelp suggested arrival time our server joe was the sweetest gentleman we ordered bloody mary mimosa and a baileys irish coffee for drinks all amazing the bloody mary basically came with an appetizer on top hah we ordered the breakfast sandwich and baked breakfast sandwich for our meals the portions were huge but so delicious the hashbrowns were better than the ones at waho and if you know me you know my love for waho hashbrowns the grits were way better than flying biscuits grits and thats saying something overall amazing place for brunch and fantastic service","1866":"ive always loved wawa  before any trip or event i would go to wawa they always have what i need their food is always fresh and it is made quickly this wawa is right around the corner and it has all of those  qualities the gas station can get crowded at times thats because the prices  in my opinion are on the lower side there is pleanty of space in the parking lot to make it easy to get arounda great feature about this wawa is the free air","1868":"excellent breakfast fare i have been there twice and i am hooked i tried their new omelette with mozzarella cheese and the salmon beni both were great   my only recommendation to the owners is to get an espresso machine and add espresso based drinks to their menu that should be an easy addition and would really complement their offerings very well","1869":"wow wowjust wow  so after a year of dying to come here i finally made it  my girlfriend treated me for my birthday  we made reservations for 2 at 6pm on a wednesday night  this place is byob so bring your wine  the place is super tiny so be prepared for that  this isnt your standard italian place by any stretch  there are only roughly 12 tables here which im sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner  the wait staff were pretty darn good  they worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing  we never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us  we decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimpbeans appetizer  the antipasto was amazing almost everything on it was unique and flavorful  my girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula  i loved the roasted red peppers frittada and asparagus  the shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant  well worth it in my opinion  for our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu  we went with the spinach gnocchi tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese  all were extremely unique  ive never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience  the tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine  i loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well  they are also pretty liberal with their bread here so order away  the tomato pie focaccia was amazing  the other bread was on par as well  we ended our night with some zeppolies  they were warm and fresh  the nutella sauce was a great modern twist  a perfect ending to a perfect meal  the place can be a bit on the high side but i think its totally worth it  this is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for 20 at chilis  on an ending note with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud  the table next to us had about 6 people and were dominating the noise space of the entire dining area  it was quite obnoxious but it was tolerableonly because of the food  am i going back do you have to ask","1871":"bombcom i forget what i ordered but it was similar to a cuban sandwich on donut bread my friend ordered a cinnamon sugar donut while she waited for her actual food and that was delicious i ate everything because it was amazing and deserves all the hype it has received i need to go back and try those stuffed donuts","1873":"a local told us about this nice coffee house on our first day in nola its nice and clean the guy behind the counter was nice and the iced mocha latte was great if your looking for great inexpensive coffee this is the place","1874":"greatest hash browns

some coffee after our long lunch so we asked our bartender and she directed us to the nearby coffeebar she told me about the lavender latte which i thought sounded interesting so i tried one on ice and it was so good i love the vibe of the place too very beautiful and great service cant wait to go back","1877":"wonderful amazing awesome convenience store best soft pretzels great sandwiches

of 11 people we got a table quick the design is super cute we walked upstairs to check out the roof top seating cant wait to sit up there for the summer i had the yuca fries as an appetizer and pork

forgotten about this little gem and when i walked in i wanted to buy all the treats they had on display  they were beautiful  i think their pricing is beyond fair for their quality product    just a

miss and its hard to find a place that serves the authentic stuff and his place nailed it went here on a friday night and brought a bottle of tequila unfortunately the free pitcher of margarita mix is only valid monday through thursday but the pitcher wasnt that expensive the empanadas and fish tacos were to die for we also got shrimp quesadillas service was great initially they brought out the wrong type of quesadillas and gave us the shrimp ones on the house  the only pitfall of this whole dining experience were the complimentary chips and salsa they were a bit meh","1893":"awesome great place the staff are friendly and met all our needs very great energy each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art if you are diabetic this is a no no for you it was soooo good the owner even came out and spoke with customers she has such a beautiful spirit so happy we stopped by we couldnt even eat it all my recommendation is to share","1894":"sat outside for an early dinner before the kentucky derby we had the chicken ribs and macaroni and the brie and crab hand pie all of it was great the meat was all tasty and tender the macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper the hand pie which is new to the menu was my personal favorite you could taste the crab and it came surrounded by a well complimented creamy cocktail sauce highly suggest everything we had","1896":"ive now tried quite a few of these strange donuts and all have been delicious and interesting  a few favorites the strange bacon idonut and the fritters   this isnt your typical donut shop so if youre bothered by unique ingredients friendly faces colorful decor or reviving a great neighborhood dont shop here","1900":"excellent breakfast we asked for several changes  eggs medium

pecans our waiter was friendly and gave us great service with a smile try this out when you are in the french quarter","1901":"dudes  seriously so good so so soooo good  the rutabaga fries are the most amazing thing ever  the rutabaga cheese is better than any real cheese wiz ive ever had in my life  the reuben cheesesteak may or may not have also brought a tear to my eyes  i mean  this place

they have a gluten free option anytime i need cupcakes i will order through here the staff was so friendly and patient with my questions","1907":"been eating here since the beginning best sonoran dog in town hands down the comp is overrated and his buns and ingredients arent as fresh their carne is also good and i also mess w a caramelo from time to time there is a reason rachel ray said they the second best hot dogs in the us","1909":"produce is fresh local when available and always tasty they accept credit cards which is pretty unique for most local produce markets i love that is a familyrun business and is much cheaper than the old tasteless produce that is sold at most supermarkets we have also bought vegetables and herbs for our garden here","1911":"great goodsized sandwiches fresh closest that youll get to ny potato salad was awesome service is great will definitely be returning","1913":"friendly staff  great bagels  awesome breads and good coffee  plus a nive atmosphere  best bagels in suburban philly  love this place","1915":"first ted drewes is more than the christmas trees that populate its parking lot from late october to december  it is frozen custard  pure sin

about st louis besides my family","1917":"we love our thai milk boba tea this place does it great theyre always adding new things too","1921":"wouldnt have known this place existed if it wasnt for yelp they make very good authentic vietnamese banh mi sandwiches i can get over how little they cost","1923":"finally got to check this place out on a girls night out  both of my other girls had separately gone before and i am so glad they suggested this   had a wonderful first impression  clean and modern with a friendly attentive hostess  the saxophonist was a nice plus  i prefer a little harder jazz but he was very talented and this is perfect dining music for most people and my friends and i enjoyed it very much  they informed me there is a jazz jam upstairs on sunday nights i will be there i am glad i had experienced guides with me  i probably would have chosen something else if both of my friends who had not previously gone to sylvias together had not gone on and on and on about the pork chops  i thought it would blasphemy to try something else  boy they were right  i had two pork chops so i could try both the fried and the smothered  they were both delicious and both completely different  the fried was perfectly battered not greasy at all nicely flavored and very tender  the smothered was a wonderful slowcooked fall apart piece of heaven  as it was all way too much for me to finish at one sitting i will be enjoying the smothered pork today i had the mashed potatoes and collard greens  both were excellent and hot  i asked for vinegar with my collards before tasting them but they were wonderfully flavored without it so i didnt use it  mashed potatoes with gravy were excellent  i am not a big fan of some of the sides that my friends got but everyone wanted to share so i tried the sweet potatoes excellent and the tomatoes and okra surprising good   i am not a big fan of corn bread either but they came to the table warm slightly sweet and moist  excellent   none of us had room for dessert but our friend said we had to have the sweet potato pie and ordered us all an order to go  i have another friend who raves about their peach cobbler  i cant personally report yet service was very friendly and attentive yet did not hover   as this was a friday night we went a few blocks north to hit 3 daughters have a beer and watch some live music afterwards  i love what is happening on 22nd street   will definitely come back and try some other items on the menu","1927":"picking up a roast and ordering meat for christmaswe decided to have a

fresh made sandwiches we love porterhouse","1929":"one thing this fat woman knows is cake i dont think i can highly recommend this gem enough except to say that 12 hours later i can not stop thinking about how delicious every single thing i tried was since it was our first trip we had the minis 2 bit cupcakes the red velvet was without a doubt the best i had ever had my husband agreed light fluffy but the icing was the perfect compliment of sweetness the sugar cookie tasted exactly like one and looked like it too i also had the chocolate salted carmel with was delicious and the coconut was the lightest most delicate cake ive ever had you do not have to be a coconut lover to relish this my son a chocoholic couldnt get enough of the blackout but said the peanut butter chocolate was just ok   we also loved the atmosphere and that it was incredibly dog friendly i loved the paper straws they even sell pupcakes minis just for dogs our server was incredibly knowledgable and friendly  my only areas that that i can suggest for improvement is that it would be nice to see a list of exactly which minis are available without getting up and looking or asking your server some sell out and the iced tea was a lavendar earl gray which i found a little too lavender we will definitely be going back","1930":"the only thing i love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here its a quiet good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offer","1931":"i am surprised this place doesnt have better reviews  i have found the people to be very nice  the meatseafood department is excellent  i live in nearby mt airy and come here a lot to get meat to grill  we also frequently take advantage of the meal of the week which typically has an entre side and desert for a very good price  they will have all the elements together and there is a recipe card you can pick up  the bakery is also very good  i agree with the commenters that the produce selection is pretty bad  this does not bother me however because we have a ton of good options for produce in the area  we have 2 weavers ways an produce in germantown and produce junction in glenside  for everything but produce i find myself coming to the fresh market a lot  i find the parking lot to be very convenient  with the layout of the store i can zip in and out very quickly  i have also never had to wait in a long line which i appreciate","1932":"ive spent an unmentionable amount of money at the flying cupcake bakery because the cupcakes are just that good  if you are going for the first time make sure to pick up at

which had a nice smokey flavor we also tried the fried cat fish we ordered spicy and theyre not messing around  cooked perfectly with a corn meal breading the fried green tomatoes were nice and had a

but i always love trying something new each visit","1962":"i have lived in 3 majors cities across the us 2 foreign countries and although i have only been to pp twice it is hands down the best pancake i have ever had sorry mom  and you dont even have to get the crazy sweet potato or buckwheat stylings to get something special just get regular old buttermilk they are perfect they are the pancake ideal  i was here for the first time about 5 years ago it was amazing i just went back for the second time the memory of my first visit in my mind and i was just praying it was as good as id remembered it was","1963":"when i visited downtown santa barbara i enjoyed the original location so much that i decided to stop by the second location later that evening  this location is far more spacious and still preserves the whimsy and artsy atmosphere i liked in the first location i ordered the magic bowl and it was absolutely amazing the baristas were also very courteous  i think this spot is more ideal for doing work or studying on a nice afternoon just a few blocks away from state st it is a bit quieter and less crowded its a bit strange that the two locations would be so close to one another but my guess is that they cater to slightly different crowds studiers vs shoppers so ill take it","1964":"finding a place where i can take my daughter whose is gluten and dairy intolerant and a vegetarian and picky as hell is impossible these guys make the impossible possible she was thrilled and everything i ate was fantastic for those nonvegetarian nongluten free and nondairy free youll love it   i had biscuits and gravy with a side of pork sausage you must try this one of the best biscuits and gravy i have ever had   the owners are a truly nice couple go out of your way to eat here its worth it","1966":"ambiencevery comfortable day or night just a lovely delicious cup of coffee served in a   cup and saucer lovely its so much more enjoyable this way and the regular size is quite generous  dont come here if youd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you cant pronounce and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup this place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio  its simply my favorite place in new orleans to get my coffee zen on oh and they do great breakfast and lunch panini","1968":"great addition to the lansdale bar scene great beer and great food awesome servers and

nice gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line most importantly i just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on fridays saturdays and sundays they are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant you can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture all of this for just 699 a very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive  but worth it","1980":"busy but quick and fast service with deliciously thick custard  i had the turtle and it was everything i thought it would be sweet smooth with a bit of crunch  this place is a st louis staple","1984":"i cant say enough about ice cream 504 the only bad thing is its with in walking distance and were finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream the flavors

the cheese room is heavenly  the prepared foods are delicious  the marinara sauce is to die for  they have hoagies and paninis made to order   visit the coffee bar for some serious brews  the gelato looks and tastes very close to the real deal in italy    they have a covered outside seating area that is cozy yet spacious  you can even go grocery shopping here    what is not to like about this place  if you like italian food you owe it to yourself to check this place out","1990":"tasty food culvers never disappoints everything ive had has been really good from their food to their cement mixers i also really like their shakes super yummy store is always clean and employees are really nice","1993":"let me start by saying i cant wait to go back to amfm for technically being in a food court in the farmers marker arnold myint sure did step it up he has created a casual yet upscale counter restaurant in a food court bravo   i ordered half of a turkey sandwich and a side of the chick pea and feta salad everything was extremely fresh which i would hope for being in the farmers market if you choose to eat at their counter which we did you get a real place setting not a recycled paper box its like you are eating at a nice restaurant but paying the same price you would pay at come crappy fastfood joint   the service was great they kept asking us if we were enjoying our meals they even gave us a taste of their mexican chocolate  coconut brownie which by the way was delicious   i could be considered a geek by some because of how fascinated i am with new innovate technology so needless to say i was more than excited when the waiter sat an ipad in front of me the screen showed a breakdown of all the food we ordered and you just swipe your card to pay then they textemail your receipt to you how cool is that  so for a fresh delicious meal under ten bucks head down to the farmers market and check out amfm","1994":"got some delicious dinner from here and it was just as good as the other chipotles ive been to i got a vegan burrito bowl with a side of corn tortillas it was very good","1995":"the hazelnut sponge cake is the best around def worth the price and its

point","2005":"decided to try this out for a late morning sunday brunch option  tried the classic breakfast a nest egg and a hand squeezed oj  firstly  super excited about housemade biscuits  its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this  gravy was tasty but could have used a little more  now in all fairness i treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment so for normal folk you may find the gravy quantity acceptable  i went with bacon which was really good  thick slices nice and crispy  and my eggs were cooked perfectly to order  i really liked the crispy potatoes as well  two small whole potatoes well seasoned and seared on the outside  the oj was fresh and tasty  not too tart   my friend had the nest egg  she thought it was really tasty but since i didnt try it i dont have much to say about that   i think the food is excellent  i will agree with other reviews  not a fan of the community seating  we didnt have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal you dont really have the privacy or the space to do that here  i am hoping the excellent food results in more seating","2006":"the food is excellent you order at the counter and then go sit down they bring you your good and they are fast my fiance order the chicken gyro and i order the beef kabob  the plates are huge","2008":"im almost thankful that there is usually a line for this place  if there was not i would eat here daily and become obese  ive only been here once but my friend and i tried 4 different kinds of pancakes  we had banana bread probably our favorite the famous sweet potato raspberry and chocolate chip  all of them were awesome we also felt the need to eat potatoes and bacon because night shifters are ravenous when they get off work in the morning  just take everyones word for it and eat here and then take the rest of the day off to recuperate from your food coma","2011":"a group of 9 met for lunch august 26 hs friends we were relegated to a back room with no one around that was a good thing we had our own private room and we did a lot of laughing and a lot of talking  trish was our incredible server and she had another server at her shoulder he was always smiling and he helped a lot  i made the reservation specifying that we needed separate checks and that i was paying for the man of celebrations meal i doubleclarified both points with trish she got it and she was unfazed these people have nerves of steel  it went like clockwork they got in cadence with our program we were slow steady and smooth  a lot of salads were ordered and enjoyed  i got a cheeseburger cheddar no bun double pickles tomato lettuce and onion southern green beans as a side i dont know whats so southern about these green beans but they were flatter and longer and bacon was involved bingo  an incredibly juicy medium cheeseburger    really good beef flavor tender i want another one  trish took pictures of our group which are now on facebook  i took half my burger home and i drank 17 glasses of water gol i had to drive home come on","2013":"stopped by here for a

servings are huge and the severs are very friendly","2017":"i was a little hesitant at first based solely on the name thinking i was getting americanized mexican food but luckily i was wrong   the business is family owned and operated and its honestly the best taco place ive found my coworker and i literally drive passed 3 other well known taco places just to come here for lunch  my go to used to be the xtreme grilled fish tacos but the owner suggested trying them tijuana style and i havent gone back you really taste the quality of the fish with the tijuana tacos that plus the cilantro purple onion and whatever sauce it is magic   everyone i have brought here loves it and goes back i would highly recommend them   only tip call ahead they get busy for lunch and calling ahead really cuts down your wait time   sorry theres no picture attached my tacos were eaten before i could take the picture","2018":"my group really enjoyed our culinary history tour with bob he was entertaining

recommend it","2020":"i almost dont want to rate this restaurant 5 staronly because im selfish and want to keep this place under the radar  ive not had one thing on the menu that wasnt delicious and ive eaten here at least 68 times in the last 3 weeks   steaks are delicious and if you like pasta try the tuscan gravy w homemade fettuccine if youve had breakfast at their beach location you find some of the same items but some prepared differently from the beach spot  i had the sausage gravy and biscuit it was probably the best i have ever eaten my companion ordered the lox eggs benedict and loved them  happy hour 26 everyday with drink and app specials i love the thai chicken flatbread  there is outdoor seating and two indoor dining areas great ambiance and the service is quite good as well the drinks are generous and delicious  parking can be a bit tricky nut go around the corner and theres parking behind and a back entrance enjoy and i might see you there","2021":"great place like the loud energy and crowd here as far as burgers go this is one of the best ive had im stl  i got the patty melt with chilli cheese fries both great although i wish the cheese on the fries were real

yummy food and excellent service cant say it any plainer than that    best tomatoes i have ever tasted well outside of those from my grandmothers garden yummy crab cakes and a great assortment of wine

a once a year trip at least from the orlando area this place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through dont let it its well organized just decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top we bought 56 cheeses  a couple of dry meats and a bottle of cannonau wine enjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella buy sfogliatelle before they are gone they run out in less than 12 hours so worth it","2028":"they should have a frequent buyers card because we spend a fortune here when we are in italy

loose tea  and thats not even counting the speciality drinks fizzes or boba pearls in the tbar lexicon  it was also nice to attend the yelp office hours with carrie and the gang last night what a great idea to get to spend a few relaxing hours with some of phillys finest  what do i normally get when i go to tbar  it really depends on the weather  if its warm outside i prefer the awake or gin fizz  these are herbal tea blends infused with fruit juice and mixed with sparkling water  very refreshing and tasty  if its cold outside i prefer to get a loose tea blend like midnight blue or classic oolong teas  if you feel overwhelmed by the choices and blends  ask the staff they are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly","2033":"i recently organized a trivia night for the nonprofit

flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them praline bacon raspberry white chocolate pineapple upside down and cookies and milk praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow it was a flavor party where sweet savory and yummy had me dancing the pineapple upside donut was good the raspberry was my least favorite however the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it overall the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty i will be back for some donuts and sliders next time","2043":"ive eaten at many indian places  this one is very good  i felt extremely guilty and very happy with the lunch buffet  it was wonderful  their vegetable dishes were top notch and the chicken tikka masala was some of the best ive ever had  also would give high marks for the onion chutney and palak paneer  id eat here often if i was local","2044":"this was such a wonderful time and i have told dozens of my friends read on  i received the tickets for the double happiness sushi  dim sum class as a birthday gift we got there early get there early and we were wonderfully surprised that it was just us and one other couple so we had lots of handon training  first we were shown the kitchen and chef poon told us lots of stories chef poon is fascinating and if you take the effort to really listen to him hes quite entertaining his sous chef was a pleasure to talk to too  then we learned how to make the dumplings i had no idea there were so many kinds we made quite a few and he allowed me to fry a batch yum really very tasty  then it was sushi time  we stood at the table and made tons of such all kinds a seaweed cone with caviar rice on the inside rice on the outside with trays and trays of fish shrimp vegetable and more  and were eating as we are making them still we had so much food left over i took home five trays of amazing sushi so much that when i brought them to my moms the next day we still couldnt finish them  so we started packing up the food and chef poon motions us to a table where he prepared dinner steak general joes chicken yum a tasty salad and our dumplings  truly it was so delicious but i needed to bring it home i was stuffed i had it on monday and it was extraordinary  then because it was my birthday he brought out a cake that he bought for me i mean that was so nice thanks chef    that said for 120 a person you get a lot entertainment two classes and a ton of food  i read some of the 1star reviews and they are nitpicking on some things the price of the fish compared to the price of the

classes","2046":"the wings are so meaty and juicy always friendly courteous and prompt the beer was ice cold perfect dinner","2049":"staff makes this place i am here now i really love this place great

reservation just a few hours beforehand although it was a very cold night so maybe it was an unpopular night for that reason im pretty picky about sushi and my boyfriend is even pickier and we both loved it the rock shrimp tempura was outstandingly fresh with a mild wasabi sauce and meltinyourmouth shrimp the izumi roll scallops and sashimi sampler were all great although ive had slightly better tuna at other restaurants dont skip dessert here the un donut dessert was unexpectedly deliciousalmost like a cider donut served fresh hot and crispy on the outside soft in the middle considering the portion sizes you get in a typical sushi restaurant i thought they were quite generous the veggie tempura is a meal in itself  it was a slow night at the restaurant and service was a bit slow i think there was only one waiter so i could see how that could be a problem when they are very busy but it wasnt enough of an issue to knock a star off","2054":"absolutely the greatest ice cream that i have ever had went on an extremely busy night but the employees remained friendly and were prompt with the service we ended up getting the four mini scoops which was enough to share we tried the cookie

soup was delicious and the martinis were spot on got the chocolate framboise and then they whipped me up a cake flavored one on request completed the night with a tiny glass of ice cream with a candle i think this will be an annual tradition ","2060":"livery is awesome  exactly what indy needed thank you cunningham restaurant group","2064":"we were extremely pleased with our omelets simple honest and tasty food the concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant for a healthfood type of breakfast per my request i wish i were staying longer so i could try pancakes","2071":"i adore inn out burgers  get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap protein style  theyve got a special menu not listed httpwwwinnoutcom and their fries are amazing  you can actually taste the potato in them  their menu is very basic but its all you need  burgers fries and shakes","2072":"4star beer 5star ambiance this is the most impressive and promising brewery in santa barbara   inside they have a high ceiling exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list it looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like ibus abv style volume poured the list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours berliners stouts pilsners and ipas  they offer very nice tasting flights which our group did you grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try this system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process  a great idea the beer quality was a bit all over the place which is expected from a new brewery however some showed a lot of promise and i think third window has what it takes to improve their recipes detailed notes are below i ended up liking their pilsner the light the best and got it in a large format mug pour   pretzels and popcorn are available which is a nice touch dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well    extra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery  the light 11 this was an outstanding german style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated the flavor was dry and a tad powdery but the finish was neutral and refreshing this was my absolute favorite of the beers i tried so i got a large pour in a giant mug   brett saison looking beautiful in the glass glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation the aroma is sawdust barn candied mango the flavor is bubbly neautral and very dry but not abrasive refreshing though a tad washed out in the flavor  rakau welch looking identical to the brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits lemongrass dill fennel oregano  super herbal the flavor is dry neutral refreshing the farmyard character of saison is spot on here simple dry but not abrasive  xexo super dry for an ipa that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive needed some work   the ko bomb inky black in color but much too thin a body for stout the nose is savory chocolate mousse big raisin chocolate covered raisin but the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda grape cough syrup and tootsie roll  executioners daughter clear amber in color this one had intense vinegar acetic acid and nail polish remover ethyl acetate in the nose taste is very nice however with cinnamon mild sugar dark bread banana nut bran muffin great mouthfeel  the origin 2016 this was billed as a dryhopped apa but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch the flavor was watery and bland overall it seemed dead and not what was intended","2078":"fantastic service and the food also great simple tasty and well priced","2081":"there is no better thai food in the tampa bay area  this is authentic thai food not your typical not too spicy please bland thai food made for americans although you can

diego you can get almost anything here  from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and youll start to get an idea of whats what here all this and mas at totally reasonable prices too i recommend trying out a cherimoya if youve never had one  its a real treat  for more info on the weekly schedule check out the website  the one on saturday is on the corner of santa barbara and cota streets and it goes from 830 to 1230 even though its pretty bustling

delicious","2098":"so yummy with so many flavors we got here 5 minutes before it closed and there was a huge line we got to stay past 10 thankfully the toppings are 50 cents extra each kind of rediculous but she put on a ton of sprinkles soooo that made up for the extra cost  the ice cream is really good and the whole place smells amazing i highly recommend","2101":"went on a googleyelp search  i had been to the italian market a few times and did not know that it existed  all i can say is where have you been all my life   ordered a couple of pounds of broccoli rabe sausage and 4 aged strips  my sons were raised on top end places for steak and asked me to go back for their birthday dinners well i am on my way today to pick up a few large steaks for the q  not cheap  but as with most things in life you get what you pay for  i will be standing in the snow cooking tonight","2102":"i was in town for business and after checking into my hotel i searched for the closest bbq place i wasnt sure what id find at hendricks but i was pleasantly surprised as i was driving through the neighborhood i liked the small town feel since i was by myself i had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside i had to stay to enjoy the decor light bulbs in mason jars flat screen tvs and an amazing lighted patio although the view is just a parking lot its too bad it wasnt closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at   i ordered pork steak which ive never heard of before and it was really good it looked like a tbone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork for my sides i chose collard greens and cole slaw the cole slaw was awesome i have a weird ritual where i always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it this one is definitely in my top 5 the slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it which i love i usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect cold and with a kick collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too if i had more time or with a group of friends id definitely come back because everything looked comfortably country","2108":"hands down favorite sub place around the atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme they totally roll with it from the table decor to the names of the subs who doesnt love a hot sub they are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place they dont have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that talk about flavor i love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink but at least you can make it special every time i go here its packed the customer service is great i love that they walk your meal to you its better than standing around or having a pager they also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any party","2111":"i love the bartenders so sweet and so charming  brielle by far is the best so sociable and very charismatic i always try to grab a beer when she is around ","2112":"bubble tea is probably the only sweet thing in life that i absolutely have to have and while this place is a bit out of the way i go here quite often to get my fix the flavors are damn good despite being powdered mixes cleanliness is a decor is cute and bright i was so stoked that they didnt just have basic fruit flavors but also taro red bean jasmine et cetera much more authentic in terms of product and taro is my shit so good they have traditional tapioca and bursting boba with fruity flavors its also in a strip mall with a really really good asian restaurant next door cantonese and by cirillas kill two birds with one stone right kidding sort of i havent tried anything else here but friends have all raved about everything from the froyo to the boba so id definitely say its a solid place overall   only complaint would be do not go during rush hour holy shit i live in broad ripple and it took over an hour to get there i mean rush hour is necessary evil but this is terrible completely my fault for not paying attention to the time but wow that is an incredibly nervewrecking experience under those circumstances just avoid the minivan suburban 500pm rush and youll be fine","2113":"i love this super cute super delicious pie shop  kelly the owner makes delicious pies from scratch including the famed sugar cream  which i had today for the very first time and was blown away by how good it was  theyve got coffee and tea and other little goodies to buy and cute tables inside and out where you can sit and enjoy your little slice of heaven or just buy a whole pie already to go and take it home to enjoy ","2114":"this place rules  anywhere that you can get a shot of booze in your hot chocolate is a winner for me  the coconut ice cream i have had in the past has tasted more like vanilla ice cream with coconut flavoring this was not the case here  chock full of coconut it was some of the best ice cream i have ever had  the whipped cream was dense and delicious and along with the hot fudge this place put forth one of the best ice cream experiences to date  the decor doesnt feel like your run of the mill diner and was excellent  i would like to go back here sometime and grab something to eat but i will certainly be making it something small so i can end big with another sundae","2115":"wow had 2 pieces of the sock eyed salmon broiled and cooked to perfection also got the dry broiled scallops with garlic butter which were

stars","2147":"busy location slow stuff clean and always well stocked good drinks they cold be a little faster but i still love starbucks ","2149":"this place dang they make some delicious donuts thats for sure i stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to nola only to their mag st location each time i visited the line was somewhat longer than what i had hoped although the line went by very quickly i waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day i cant really complain there a few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate donut togo window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go what a brilliant idea  per their name they obviously serve items other than donuts they have breakfast items about 5 or 6 to choose from till 11am at 11am they begin serving lunch items  sliders and tacos i am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there i had to try one of their breakfast biscuits i opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich holy cow it was delicious really hit the spot   i never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but i had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious after seeing photos of them though i had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns not too much excitement there if you ask me id much rather have it on a biscuit  anyways back to the donuts they offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day they have their standard glazed cinnamon sugar iced donuts each day those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored and sometimes filled donuts check out their instagram page to see what they are serving each day it is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day  i just wanted to go everyday and try all of them my wallet would be so mad at me being the huge bacon lover that i am i had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu my last day in nola it finally did i was pumped it was delicious fresh flavorful and savory the bacon was honestly pretty good by itself  i tried two of their drinks as well the sprocacola and their arnold palmer sprocacola was interesting to say the least i was glad i tried it  but dont think i will get it again the arnold palmer was also pretty decent my ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though  too much lemonade  the establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized my party and i were always able to find a seat no matter how busy it was so with all of this said i would definitely go back if in the area again","2150":"you will not find a more authentic place as this from the decor to the food to the wait staff mercedes parked out back this is 100 greek and authentic food is fantastic from the pita bread and hummus to the authentic greek cuisine while it may have touristy feel there are plenty of locals and greek people eating here i enjoyed every min of our experience here there were so many choices on the menu that it was tough to choose i had the combination along with a greek salad delicious  you wont be disappointed","2151":"this is my goto neighborhood bar the ambiance is awesome i love all the cool retro lighting they have the staff is friendly and the food is solid we typically like to go on the later side of the evening around 10 or 11 at that hour i dont see how you could have any issues with servers or food what i really like about his place is that the menu is really seasonal they always have something new and interesting to try i particularly remember a really great  arugula and watermelon salad i had over the summer go and enjoy","2152":"i had the wheat berry salad sooooo amazing the bartender not sure of his name took great care of me and was so

a juice and both were amazing and the bowl was substantial for a size small this place is definitely a cute little hidden gem its drive through only which i kinda like it was a little difficult maneuvering my car but worth it definitely will be back to try an aa bowl","2157":"finally somebody giving sweetie pies some type of competition   had the smoked pork steak it was excellent  so tender

chain would be absurd butchurchs chicken rocks so much better than kfc and if you are nursing a hangover this hits the spot the biscuits are buttery sweet goodness mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection the right amount of stiffness without being a brick although i recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste  just like i remember from my southern upbringing do not count calories at this place and no i do not make it a habit to hit up churchs on a weekly basis i consider i nice treat every couple of months price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on lindbergh in south county if i am going to do fast food this is my place of choice","2164":"daves dogs is a hot dog stand in a parking lot  nothing

dogs","2165":"first time to district donuts and whew it was amazing started out with a cold brew and the best cinnamon roll of my life there were so many scrumptious looking donuts i wanted to try but once i saw that cinnamon rolli was sold they warmed it up and the sugar at the top caramelized to add a bit of a crunch mmm   i also ordered a couple of sliders cali fries and their croque madam sandwich like a dummy when i heard the name sarah at the counter i rushed to get my sandwichbut like every other 20 year old girl who are also named sarah i started munching into the wrong sandwich i felt a little guilty once i realized it but boy was it delicious the guys behind the counter called out my actual order and when i told them what happened they couldnt have been nicer about it gave me my complete order and offered to go boxes if we needed it very friendly staff the cali fries werent my absolute favoritefelt like they were just doused in mayo but sandwiches and sliders were very yummy this place is definitely deserving of your visit","2168":"had the sweet potato pancakes waited in line outside for an hour but it was so worth it the atmosphere was great and the service was top

invited me to their home for a lovely greekcypriot dinner provided i bring my own wine and pay them about 40 id accept that invitation any day   kanella simply offers classic rustic dishes made with fresh often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food youll see him buzzing around the dining room advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them might come off as heavyhanded but this guy knows exactly what hes doing   biggest hits for me include the whole fish or any filet on the menu duck breast and pork loin for dessert its always the galaktobureko heaven   brunch is fantastic too and an even more affordable way to enjoy kanella plus the service is always spoton no matter how full the restaurant is","2180":"i was here on the soft opening day 1118 the official opening is on 1121 drinks were buy one get one they were handshaking all the drinks so it took a while our order was after a big group one so it took 30 minutes to get our two orders they are still working things out so its understandable   the boba here are are very unique they are clear and jelly like in texture with a hint of something fruity it was a refreshing change they appear to specialize in foam milk teas i ordered a standard boba milk tea which is the equivalent of ordering chicken tenders and fries at a restaurant it was okay but the boba made it worth it my sister ordered a boba sakura oolong tea without the foam she enjoyed it very much and will be coming back   the decor of this place is super cute and i would rate it the cutest bubble tea in chinatown the owner is also very friendly and nice","2181":"just had a very pleasant visit  vietnamese coffee was bomb  a bit too sweet for my liking but still delicious and hit the spot  moist flavorful fried

to have such a terrific butcher nearby","2190":"we recently checked out gm bistro off la canada and lambert and it was cramped noisy and the food was average only soso  what a pleasant surprise to find chopstix and have a really superior experience  im very strictly glutenfree and they have a real glutenfree menu with about 6 pages not just a handful of choices  my husband ordered the orange chicken the same meal as he had at gm for a true comparison and raved about how much better it was at chopstix i had a lettuce wrap appetizer  almost 2 off during happy hour  consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself and was incredibly tasty  i loved it so much i ordered a second one had about 45 more wraps out of it then had to have them box up the rest  i hated to have to stop eating it was so good but i was so full  i have a medical situation where i have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner and i cant remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me  and most of the time its rare that i can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them  so the service was excellent the food was outstanding and i had a lovely conversation with the manager whose last day it was  he has worked with the southern arizona celiac association so the employees at chopstix are extremely welleducated re gluten issues there which is great because i got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at native new yorker due to poor education on gluten crosscontamination they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading  if i could give more than 5 stars i would  this is definitely a restaurant that is getting put high on our list of ones to frequent often","2192":"good breakfastnot all your traditional meals but fresh and delicious i love the nest sub with scrambled eggs  ask for jelly after you eat the

risk of crosscontamination isnt worth it because i feel horrible afterward i was thrilled when i found out about new day here in st louis at our first visit we tried the lasagna biscuits and gravy cheesecake and a brownie yes you can order breakfast and dinner at the same time of day and they were all very good my husband doesnt have a gluten restriction and he loved everything as well im excited about ordering some sweets and freshly baked breads and having them shipped to my home what a nice option ","2225":"a spectacular establishment that instantly takes you back to childhood

checking out the reviews a week prior to our visit we stayed in clearwater and it was well worth the 30 minutes trip a little very down homy type of placewith little atmosphere dont be fooled by the looks but the lobster meal we had was super well worth it we had two lobster bisque cups every spoon full had a large pieces of lobster chunks it was excellent then we both had the lobster roll sandwich although the bread is not like philadelphia quality the lobster made up for it the price did not out way the quality a must do at least once","2261":"best burger joint ive seen in a while

once or twice a week reg  service is friendly from the cashier to the fry guys to josh and his happy helpers in the back theyre always helpful and enjoy chit chat and quick jokes they seem to genuinely enjoy their job and social interaction its always fun to catch them jamming out to the eclectic rock station always playing for ambiance just a chill group of guys n gals i dont want to call the space small because it doesnt feel cramped its more like its interactive and fitting for a fastmoving burger joint think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel low rise tables in front for relaxing some hightops with a different perspective in the corner and the barstyle counter make it so u can pick your style comfort with paintings and articles all over youre bound to have some conversation pieces nearby as well everything seems clean from tables floors and counters to the separate area in the back for butchering meets to the clearly labeled bins for different trash and

they have a number of gluten free options and accommodate to preventing cross contamination to the best of their abilities if you mention your dietary needs my fav thing from there is their chicken quesadillas","2271":"amazing burgers craft beers specialty cocktails and homemade ice cream desserts  the burgers you have choices of substituting beef chicken lamb or bison they put a spin on everythingeven the ketchup they even have a weekly burger battle where the most ordered burger lives on another week to get challenged by another special contender   my son and i spilt a banana split that was simply incredible a scoop of triple chocolate and one of coconut crunch with a caramelized bananaget outta here you know the melty part of a banana split at the bottom of the bowl that nobody likeswe didnt find it here","2278":"this was the best blt wrap that i have ever had the bacon was  perfectly prepared  thick and crisp but not burnt","2279":"the real deal  we ate some of the finest pastries ive ever had in my life at this bakery word  we were fortunate enough to be with the other gruntled brunchers who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries   just some of what we tried opera cake  a moist multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu apple strudels fruit tarts  eclairs chocolate covered strawberries all were delicious but then the cheese puff pastry came out   the cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own impossibly insanely flaky just sweet enough almost salty how can this be i could have eaten five of these make certain you dont miss this  we were fortunate to be there on good friday so we could get a hot cross bun i thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising i was so so wrong this traditional treat is a briochetype bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout and an icing x drawn on the top again light airy with sweetness that is a hint not a sledgehammer theres a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun and patricia the executive chef took the time to tell us check it out on wikipedia if youre curious  and i have to say something about the raspberry bear claw if youve ever had what others call a bear claw forget those brent said its an insult to this crazygood flaky justright pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine   we took a field trip as harry said through the kitchen where ziggy the owner pastry chef and allaround nice guy was making a harry potter wizard hat cake he rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake he gave us a taste of the fondant in my experience fondant is pretty but not so tasty not so for this chocolate fondant mmmmmmm i would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff   we left with a tea cake in tow ziggy told us it was something like a kugelhof and not as heavy as a pound cake it was so beautiful i simply had to try one though at this point i really didnt need more pastries i had a piece as soon as i could get a knife again unbelievablei cant say more somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light and just moist enough without approaching stickiness i had more of this than i care to admit right after id eaten my weight in sweets  at this point im glad i do not live down the street from maple street patisserie i could see myself having a problem if i lived too close to a bakery this tempting  just to sum it all up the sweet pastries are delectable but the breads brioches bear claws and tea cakes are in a class all their own  and i havent even tried the savory croissants yet","2280":"great staff great drinks the 5 is because they make my current favorite local beer the undisputed shadow boxer very nice place inside and i highly recommend a stop here at some point in your night out","2283":"insane   the best foodie joint ive eaten at for fast casual chain   burgers are amazing but you must try the

friendly and helpful  the prices can be a bit high sometimes so i dont go there for my big grocery trips but i do stop in a few times a week for things i run out of or forget  additionally the hot bar salad bar and ready made meals are a go to for a quick but tasty lunch  one thing that stands out is if the store doesnt have something  they can order it and call you when its in one of the employees in the frozen foods section named alton was extremely helpful in getting a hard to find item ordered for me and personally called me when it was in amazing customer service","2312":"this place is a gem and i highly recommend it  i had read some really positive comments about it on twitter so i decided to try it today and i was not disappointed  its a bakerycoffee shop that also has a great lunch menu  the food is expertly prepared and extremely creative  they seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients for example today i had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy the mushroom tart i ate today was rich buttery and delicious of course its a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good  they have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on twitter and facebook its haunting me and i might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow  they also make their own bagels which is super exciting for this bornandraisednew yorker everything is made fresh every day i was told by the friendly helpful man who waited on me at the counter  the place itself has a nice clean modern decor its a long narrow space with the pastry countercash register towards the back and about six or seven small tables running down the length of the room with chairs and a comfortable bench with pillows i didnt stay long today but it looks like the type of place you could go hang out and drink coffee for a while or go have lunch with a friend    i dont even live uptown but i hope to become a regular at this place  revised on 992013 to add  i have been back here a few times and i can now report that they have some of the best espresso drinks in the city  super yummy lattes","2317":"this bakery is amazing from the decor to the quality of the service  come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts  the prices are incredibly reasonable the biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order i recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the mm cookie both were amazing and you really cant go wrong","2318":"green eggs and ham sandwich was delicious the biscuit was peppery and perfectly baked we also had the ricotta toast and i was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was i highly recommend this place for an early morning breakfast spot","2320":"first time here tonight we got a salted caramel cupcake a mocha chocolate chip cupcake and a peanut butter pudding the cupcakes were moist  the frosting was so silky and creamy so good but the star of the show was the peanut butter pudding holy crow  never had anything like it before  it was more of a creamywhipped mousse like pudding the peanut butter flavor was not too sitting strong or overwhelming like peanut butter can be  throughout was some of her peanut butter cookies  so soft  it mixed wth the pudding like perfection we live in nj but we will absolutely be back","2324":"recently moved away from st louis and i miss this place the atmosphere is very interesting and unique first of all the decor is pretty unusual and its fun to sit on the balcony the food is great and all locally sourced and homemade even

breakfast spot we even occasionally meet up with friends and family here   so far we have tried 3 different varieties of the crepes and they are ridiculously delicious most if the crepe shops i find try to over do the fillings or toppings to mask the lack of flavor in the crepes not this place perfect balance of everything without being too much  my wife has tried a couple sandwiches and they have all been awesome  the smoothies are killer and made with locally sourced ingredients   the owner has even come out and sat with us she is super accommodating and personable  the only downside to the station is the lack of advertising if there was a bigger sign we would have found this place sooner lol","2340":"buddy brew is the place to go for morning coffee and a delicious breakfast their toast totally blows my mind its the best toast ive had in a long time possibly ever parking around 730 am can be a challenge though bc the lot gets very crowded","2341":"hands down the best pancakes i have ever had  i have been here 4 times already and i have never been disappointed the pancakes here are so good and the milky cinnamon syrup that they serve is the best thing ive put in my mouth must try are the sweet potato pancakes and the banana pancakes ive also tried their eggs and sausage combo and their omelettes and they both were amazing  the great thing about the combos is that you can substitute your regular buttermilk pancakes with any of the specialty pancakes if you want a hearty meal i recommend the omelette the staff is really nice and the inside is bigger than i thought when i was outside the only downside about the place is that if you go on weekends there is going to be a line that is wrapped abound the building this place is super popular when tourists so it might be a long wait but i think it is so worth","2342":"we got up early on our vacation just to get to pancake pantry before the line  it was well worth it  the selection of pancake styles is amazing  i had traditional and my bf had pecan both were wonderful and were complimented perfectly by the salty deliciousness of bacon on the side  we were told to ask for mary and truly she was the sweetest waitress alive    this place is well worth the wait but you could also get up an hour earlier than normal and beat the crowd","2343":"short waits strong drinks great food service sets them apart my

eat here ","2363":"enjoyed our meals here  the service was great and the sangrias are the best in town  my husband had the all time favorite spaghetti and meatballs and i filled up on their amazing chicken alfredo your way and i added shrimp which were succulent and huge  i would highly recommend this restaurant to those who like a smaller environment with personal service  they were very busy for mothers day but the service was great and it did not take long for our food to arrive  they were certainly prepared for the day and they even gave all mothers a fresh cut red rose  excellent food great service and wonderful environment","2366":"our familys favorite place for breakfast  the hashbrowns are the reason to go along with the eggs provencale  my son loves the french toast with fresh strawberries so much he eats an adults serving no problem  visit the attached bakery for some of the best pastries in tucson   it could be a scary location for nontucson natives but dont fret  this kind of weird setting in a ghetto strip mall next to a crappy safeway is what tucson is all about  you wont be disappointed","2367":"my family loves frost  this is the only place we go when we want a

fried eggs for 10   i have seen some reviews on here and people complain about grounds in their coffee  umm all they serve is either french press coffee or greek coffee which is a lot like turkish coffee  it is expected to have grounds in it  the french press coffee was amazing as well   as i write this i see that i am using the word amazing an awful lot but i cant help it   i also ordered greek yogurt with honey and walnuts which was unrealsee i didnt use amazing here  my gf who hates greek yogurt really enjoyed it   all in all the food was amazinghad to the service was spot on and the

incredible beers this has been one of my favorite places for a while  the black bean burger here is incredible i wouldnt call it the best in town just yet but i did drive out of the way to come here just to have it  if your an ipa person you have to stop by for the dragon fly which is on tap year around every sunday when they have 3 pints we drive up here from south indy just for the

different about the seafood here located a short cab ride from downtown philly is dinardos a nondescript red brick building with a wooden sign swaying in the breeze points to the front entrance of this establishment the huge crab on their sign hints that maybe you should try the crab the blue claw crabs are flown in everyday from the gulf coast unlike their cousins in the chesapeake these gulf coast crabs are free swimmers which means bigger crabs and more meat  lets look at their raw bar clams on the half shell are half dozen freshly shucked icecold beauties served atop ice accompanied by cocktail sauce and lemon these clams are sweet with a scent of the sea  these are the best clams on the half shell i have ever had the cocktail sauce is the best cocktail sauce ive ever had sweet with

that good","2419":"took the grapes n hops tour with shawn  my wife and i had a fantastic time  there were three wineries and a stop at figueroa brewing to end the tour  sogno del fiori was our

mommoms food cart at a night market and now theyve opened a brickandmortar restaurant around the corner at 2551 orthodox street in bridesburg score  sorry this is a bit of a bare bones review but when i looked at the reviews and saw there was only one from 2018 and none so far for the restaurant i felt like i had to get another recent one up   the food is delicious  flavorful and more complex than i expected i wasnt raised in a polish family but friends who were say its also very authentic the pierogi dough is so soft and light its almost like a crepe the atmosphere is charming and homey and the service is friendly knowledgeable and lowkey the vanillabourbon apple sauce is all i care about in the world from this point on the kielbasy is from czerws down in port richmond and it is great  my partners family has it for christmas every year i highly recommend the gobki  its got some zing and luckily for me reheats beautifully since i totally overordered my first time here also i had never heard of pickle soup but now i want it all the time especially when its cold and rainy and im feeling under the weather all of the bread they serve here  the long rolls the dark rye  is excellent do yourself a favor and stop by this unpretentious byob gem","2422":"ice cream martinis what more could one want one a friday night their food is good as well portions are filling and taste good the ambience of the place is what really sold it for me its a great hangout","2426":"fresh baked goods with kawha coffee their concept of selling mini size cakes is genius my kids ordered a couple mini size cakes with a mini glass of milk one mini with milk is just 150 the owner is passionate about this shop and i hope they grow to the point that they can be open everyday the best item on the menu is the banana pie i also like the red velvet and chocolate caramel","2430":"amazing fudge shop owned by wonderful people you can taste whatever you want before you make a choice and the people who work there are really nice and fun","2431":"my husband and i eat at molldeli about once a week marking it one of our favorite lunch spots were kind of food snobs and we find it to be a great experience all around the restaurant was purchased by its current owner maybe 6 months ago and it has certainly changed for the better the menu is now chef inspired with the specials truly highlighting the talented kitchen but quite honestly both my husband and i have our favorites on the regular menu so we rarely even make it to the special board   we all know the foundation of a great sandwich is delicious bread and molldelli has certainly figured that out both the regular hoagie roll and the wheat roll are fantastic my husbands favorite sandwich is the hot salami but do be warned it is super spicy and i adore the chicken club but lately weve both been fixated on the buffalo chicken salad its so good you know when you order a salad and the ratio of lettuce to toppings is off thats very much not the case with this salad  you have plenty of toppings from start to finish the only change we make to it is having the chicken served hot on the menu its cold its just a personal preference but for us it makes it just slightly better   no matter what you order at molldeli you will have a great food experience they appeal to all customers having both the traditional and more daring menu items available i agree with the sign  best sandwiches off the hill","2432":"this place makes all other sweet shops look like amateurs i had a chance to try their salted caramel banana pudding and their hot apple cider let me tell you  once you try their stuff you wont want anything else other than their sweets  they are that good  also the folks that run and work at this shop are very friendly they make you feel like you are at home no pretentiousness here either its all about putting out a superior product and they succeed","2436":"wife absolutely loved the scramble  they have children toys and books  my son read a book while we waited for our food  i got the breakfast sandwich and it was decent but i felt toast was too crispy  im just being picky its a nice breakfast

make an exception for this place with the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing ill have to return sooner than later especially for the thai tea as well

favorite","2454":"started with a few drinks nice custom cocktail selection waitress was real nice and went through the menu with us its almost all shared plates very trendy cool concept rarely pulled off well started with buffalo pork belly and meatballs pork belly was really good good spicy and fatty  you have to be into that thing meatballs were excellent the only thing i would have wanted were toast points or crustinis to dip in the left over sauce the margarita pizza was awesome wood fired thin sauce which i believe belongs on a pizza and a doughy thin crust finished up with some vanilla and nutella gelato great meal well be back","2456":"worth it we have been going to the crabby bills group for over 30 years and its still pretty damn good","2458":"the food was excellent dont let the rating discourage you everything we ordered was great the outside patio was also really pleasant and the service was really good too","2460":"i love this place gourmet breakfastbrunch fare at not too high prices the bloody mary should be on a magazine cover","2463":"reservations gourmet togo is often overlooked at as a seminole heights eatery but shouldnt be reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook the kicker is that if you have been to reservations youll crave it even when you have time to cook  reservations serves quality home cooked meals togo and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious  not only is reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated the owners anthony and elke live here in seminole heights and make everything from scratch  one order will usually serve a two people  we have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers  the order pictured to left included  yankee pot roast fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots onions green beans and potatoes for 1195  chicken rustica  boneless breast sauted with crushed red pepper garlic capers olives tomato and romano for 1195  the yankee pot roast was good but the chicken rustica was fantastic btw i am a fan of olives  the mashed potatoes are great and the salads are above average other hits include the chicken marsala and the meatloaf reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the polenta lasagna polenta layered with portobellos parmesan mozzarella and pomodoro sauce  reservations specials change weekly make sure you sign up for their email list which is on a clipboard on the front counter  there is seating at reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich  the hot sandwiches are a must try topping the hot sandwich list are the hot meatloaf hoagie and the buffalo chicken finger sub for 795 each  if you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you 450 the cheese cake is a hit among neighbors but i have to give my personal recommendation to the carrot cake i am not a fan of carrot cake but the reservations version kicks ass","2464":"zios is honestly one of my favorite pizza places in philadelphia for anyone from nynj its one of the few places you could get classic pies like they make over the bridge sandwiches pastas salads and appetizers are all pretty good too staff has always been very friendly and treat us well when we eat in","2465":"such a cute shop and the owner is so nice she recommended a lot of spots around the city for us too go check out this shop for all of your souvenir needs ","2470":"as you age your tastes in everything changes after entering adulthood and the expected tour of duties of the bar scene you may be fortunate to find some friends who also share the same fear of alcohol and partying as you do although i grew up with board games my friends werent board game frenzied yet and the ones we played werent as engaging as the ones we have found with age thankfully it seems like my group of friends have reached an age where sitting around a table with teacoffeewinebeer and a good board game is more enjoyable than dreading the morning headache and dads after a night of clubbing  i still play the classics like rummicub life cluedo but if you ask some avid board gamers in their mid to late 20s they might mention games you may never heard of such as 7 wonders suburbia love letter dominion and the ever favorite but not mine settlers of catan  as board gamers these new breeds of board games are sometimes much more expensive than the games youre used to some creep close to 10000 based on popularity and awards  an alternative to buying the games is to head on to table top cafe and renting games for the day instead of going to a coffee shop to read a nice book why not go to a cafe with some friends and play some board games for a spectacular cost of 500 this is a great way to try new games before taking the plunge they even have some tasty pastries hot teas coffees and beer too if you like to play and eat which is great because this way you wont smear your grubby fingers on my board set  their selection of board games  is quite impressive i would even say they carry games that trump even river city games in terms of selection like a game you just played no problem you can purchase a brand new copy in store unfortunately like most physical retailers their mark up is about average and the same as river city but if youre in a rush to just buy a game right away and dont plan on buying many games off online retailers to save on shipping this is a great alternative  oh did i also mention i offensively played cards against humanity for a few hours quite loudly and it was perfectly acceptable thats an ok in my book  pro tip book a table in advanced to guarantee your spot  pop up video fact locally owned and run","2476":"their bobba is amazing all of the food ive tried is exquisite and reasonably priced i would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their food","2477":"i finally can get to

years much to the chagrin of our wallets and diets id say 90 of the time we get the beer cheese crock my partner likes the esb while i like the monon porter and the lawnmower pale most vegetarian dishes can be made vegan and they have an extensive veg friendly menu the vegan fish and chips is one of my favorite meals in indy but i also love the seitan wings seitan reuben veggie coconut bacon on either the blt or the fried egg sandwich and of course the weekly specials can we make the illinois horseshoe wblack bean burger a regular menu item some people complain that service can be slow or cold but personally thats part of the charm for me servers are always friendly but they are handsoff and leave us to do our thing protip during the warmer months make sure to stop in on thursdays for tails and ales adoptable dogs hang out in the parking lot and strut their stuff to all of us potential adopters its always one of my favorite nights out","2498":"ive been to nordstrom before but this

of our first stops on our quest for quality cupcakes and we were not disappointed the service is very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their flavors and presentation fast forward to now there were a few birthdays coming up in my family and after spending lots of money on christmas gifts i wanted to keep it simple and affordable sugar rush is very close to my house so i thought why not get everyone some beautiful gourmet cupcakes and a nice card boom easy awesome gift i went in and was greeted by a nice woman who was happy to answer any questions i had after browsing all of the flavors there are a lot something for everybody i ended up buying all of their margarita cupcakes because that flavor was my favorite out of all the ones i tried a few years ago i love that they have containers for just 1 or 2 cupcakes perfect for gifts my family members loved their cupcakes upon seeing them and said they were delicious of course i had to get one for myselfit was just as yummy as i remember i will definitely be back for more","2500":"this is my familys go to when we eat out for chinese the place is not big but its decently modern the quantity and the quality of their food are always good some items on the menu might be a little pricy but most of the items off their menu are worth the money one only improvement i can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time weve had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy nevertheless this is a great spot and by far the best chinese food restaurant in the area","2502":"this was an outstanding experience great customer service great food will come back again try lane

burrito is to die for the burrito is packed with flavor and filling you get a piece of fish every bite you get the spice level is just right and it leaves so full but still wanting for more  tacos  are alright nice flavors but nothing too special most of the time the avocados arent very ripe so you dont really get any flavor from it   katsu  is pretty good i love the sauce they drizzle the chicken and rice with i just wish they would put a little bit more sauce on it i sorta wish there was more going on because it is essentially breaded chicken with rice and a salad   gave 5 stars because the fish burrito is that good it is the only thing i need from this truck it is just so good","2520":"excellent got the broiled octopus super tender excellent service  server was on point all

subway restaurants standard fare the chip selection is frankly magnificent the soda fountain and iced tea station are immaculate blah blah blah what youre really reading this for is my opinion of the angry man the other reviews of this subway complain about sure hes grumpy but i like to think of it like the seinfeld episode with the soup nazi its part of the experience and adds to its appeal and i certainly wouldnt let it sour my experience of choosing that perfect bag from the chip rack its a subway people and this ones as good as any   ps ive yet to meet a sandwich artist who had suggestions

hand made drawings were dangled about the fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air really riles up the sweet tooth in a person   noteworthy flavors  creole cream cheese cheesy vanilla goodness  champagne violet really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral  red velvet cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout  strawberry sangria fresh strawberry taste in

no tables or seats available but after looking at the extensive cocktail menu we decided to stay for at least a drink even if we had to stand  while we were choosing drinks two separate servers came by to tell us there would be a table available soon and that theyd get it cleared right away    the pumpkin pie martini was on special  one of my friends ordered it and several others tried it and they all agreed that it was delicious first i had the ultimate chocolate martini which was superb  the rim was chocolatealmost like magic shell before it hardens  i followed it up with an almond joy

chance we chose the perfect time to dine here and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline with the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal it was late in the day and having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing we were ravenous so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense new england style clam chowder we followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels served in a white wine and garlic broth every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty french bread and then splitting an order of calamari sauteed in butter garlic white wine and sundried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini including tax and tip we stuffed ourselves for only 1700 each the very nautical decor and bustling openair kitchen add to your dining enjoyment theres a long bar where food is also served that seats a couple of dozen and a massive aquarium  with water pumped up from the ocean below  houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters other waterfront spots in santa barbara easily will cost twice as much for a far less satisfying meal if youre looking for seafood this is the place to eat while in town","2671":"so good everything home made everything ive tried is delicious and really good drinks and pastries highly recommend ","2673":"i work at supercuts next to jeannines and last week a worker from here delivered a box of

perfect lunch spot for me  like others before me have stated the wait can be long but i usually get around that by opting for a later lunch on days that i choose to eat from the falafel truck 100 is usually perfect   some people are offended by konstadinos rules but really i appreciate them the fact that there isnt a menu is exciting i like not knowing exactly what im going to get but maybe im more adventurous than some people really though its not even like he switches things up that much he just tweaks the details a bit the chicken is always on the platter there is always falafel and there is always hummus the dessert salad and the chickpea saladricewhatever is all that really changes  and i also appreciate that he doesnt let you hold a spot for someone or order more than one platter he realizes that most of his clientele are working folks that are on tight schedules   if youre lucky you might catch him on a good day and hell throw in a free drink its only happened to me once or twice but still a nice little perk and if it happens to be cold outrainy out he sometimes offers soup while you wait   as far as comparing him to mamas i do enjoy mamas but the falafel truck takes the cake in my opinion  its 10 well spent especially since i usually get two meals out of it just be prepared for some serious lingering garlic breath","2684":"took husband to maynards on a

the feelings of distress at having to complete hours and hours of work and transforms it into a pleasurableor at least tolerable experience  it not only provides me with the space i need to focus and a good cup of coffee to help me stay awake and motivated but unlike other coffee houses it actually offers a great atmosphere and vibe i always feel extremely cozy and positive in the space books on the bookshelves art on the walls dimmed lights and colors all around are just some of characteristics that create a wonderful ambiance    it truly is a local coffee house like no other and i love all of it best of all its in my lovely mid city neighborhood   i am going to make it a point to visit more often","2699":"i was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in boise for work spent my free time drinking

building is an old train station","2705":"another outstanding doughnut shop in st louis large selection of some of the best in the city the apple fritter here is the winner but you cant really go wrong one of my favourite things about this place is that it is open almost all of the time so you dont need to get there before midday most days to get your fill  its also next to both ted drewes if youre a fan im pretty ambivalent about ted drewes its fine but no more and the excellent aya sofia so if you really want to pig out this is a good part of town to be in","2706":"great service and

me  a large bowl of pho a bbq pork sammy togo for later in the afternoon a vietnamese coffee with boba  man o  man the best i have made this a lunch staple about 50 times over  the only time i have been a little disappointed is when they ran out of basil for the pho   they also need to make sure their bathroom is a little cleaner i have had pho in boise in about 5 other locations  this place has the best broth handsdown","2708":"most towns have a good little donut place in the case of bridgeport thats suzyjo  i havent found any other places as good in the area so its worth a visit if youre in kop or norristown  my personal favorite is their cream stick  the cinnamon twist and apple fritter are also worth the drive  i try not to stop in frequently but its always a treat when i do  the people who work here are also very friendly  just a good oldfashioned local business with quality donuts","2709":"food was delicious and of great quality although it was a smaller menu the coffee is served in a togo cup and bottomless for 3 the seating area is smaller and there is a larger communitystyled table the staff was all so polite and helpful","2710":"loved the atmosphere and the coffee pulled off 101 looking for a snack but when a coffee lover sees a place called french press i had to detour lol i guess you could call me a pesky customer i had a lot of questions before i selected which coffee i was buying which were all cheerfully answered i was intrigued by their cold brew and the batista explained process and taste and offered me a sample love the customer service thanks guys  between my group i tried 2 blends of coffee one french pressed one espresso and the tres leches coffee which was unique and yummy i suggest trying it its sweet and creamy but not enough to take

place to visit","2720":"one of the best steaks ive ever had granted you can find an equivalent steak for the half the price but what youre paying for here is atmosphere and elegance id suggest dulingkurtz as a meal for a special occasion   the breadturnovers they serve before you receive your meal are mouth watering the turnovers are served with your choice of butter or house made lemon curd a truly unique taste  the steak as mentioned above was superb served with a peppercorn crust and drizzle the taste is something ill never forget served with garlic parmesan french fries with garlic aioli and grilled asparagus the only entree that is served with fries  excuse me frites at restaurants like dulingkurtz we call them frites god dammit    everything was phenomenal dont come here expecting to pennypinch youre going to overpay for anything and everything but youll be satisfied with taste and experience","2723":"very cool place the food is fresh and delicious and the donuts

excellent reviews i found on yelp and i am so very pleased with the results leigh anne kept in constant contact with me about details and the end result was fabulous of course i had a special requestthats why i chose to do some investigating the comments people make mean alot to me and i am very happy that she was able to make and deliver my special cake which was a law book with a gavel and tassle typically meant for a law students graduation but we used it to celebrate an attorneys 40 year anniversary everyone loved it and asked who made it so a polite suggestion leigh anne when you make cakes from now on turn it in with a few of your business cards so that the host can hand out your card when people want to know who made it ours was white cake with fresh strawberries in a strawberry mousse filling it was delicious thank you so much for all your hard work you will be hearing from me again","2726":"i loved the poke bowl they allow for a lot of customization and you can

fudgery in the riverside nola outlet next to the hilton nola riverside was a new treat for me personally when i went to look at the goodies that they had to offer i wanted a particular type of candy apple once again touching on my inner child  to see what that story is about check out my review on the popcorn bistro   what was a blessing and displayed an essence of true customer service was how the ladies kristeon joseph and simmeon bazile went the extra mile and create a candy apple created especially for me i was soooo elated my inner child was cheezzing that others wanted to see why i was so happy and was slowing down to take a peak as well   i cant wait to taste the deliciousness of the candy apple i had carmel almonds with a drizzle of chocolate which was their special touch added i

older post  the renovation is lovely the coffee still the same but its 330 with the craft fair going on at rittenhouse and lacolombe has the most inefficient team working the bar incredibly inefficient and kind of scattered   the line which usually moves really quickly just crawled  i usually get a sidecar iced coffee this time the espresso sidecar was filled nearly to the top of the glass  it is usually just a halfinch","2741":"czerws kielbasy was amazing  the neighborhood alone was a highlight  never having been to poland it was filled with polish businesses and establishments

no other and ive eaten them all over the world even at well known bakeries and ive come to realize that im lucky the flying cupcake is here in indy and that their cupcakes consistently make me happy their cupcakes are some of the best ive had and i havent had one i didnt enjoy either the cupcakes are large and reasonably priced sometimes im bad and i can eat a whole cupcake sometimes two in one sitting fatgirlheart but theyre definitely large enough to share the frosting to cupcake is at a good ratio while i love them all some of my favorites are the red velvet elvis auf wiedersehen pretty in pink and pucker up they have some vegan options and seasonal cupcakes as well if you ever get distracted by the bits and bobs they have in store please take a moment and admire how freaking cute

ca that i would try the sweet potato pancakes as he is a huge fan of everything sweet potato i for one was hesitant  man was it delicous it lived up to the hype the cinnamon cream syrupooh the syrupwow i mean wow it was orgasmic i mean really i didnt know food could make a grown adult cry as i ate my pancakes i wondered when i would return to eat this yummy nectar of the gods i knew i would have to return with my husbandwho didnt think nashville had anything good to offer which is why he stayed behindboy oh boy was he mistaken nashville has delicious food  if i knew that the syrup was that good and that they didnt sell it i would have take a big purse with mebeware pancake pantry staff i will return to take a bottle home with me   the ham was fantastic too  the service was quick

hubs and i stopped in st charles to crash with a friend on our crosscountry road trip back from our honeymoon and the goal was to get bbq in every city where we dined  this was by far the best experience we had we sidled up to the bar and loved seeing the old rusty butchersknife tap handles  the bartender was friendly greeted and talked with us for a while recommended a couple of local beers all the ones on tap are local craft and we ordered some specials to go we drank the beers while we waited and they were delicious the wait by the way was almost nonexistent they had our food out to us in i think less than 7 minutes  i got the texasstyle brisket on special with a side of sweet potato casserole andi honestly cant remember the other side because that one was so bomb as were the ones with dhs meal  dh got the picktwo with sausage and pulled pork sides of cheesy grits and baconbraised greens  holy moly it was all so mouthwatering that i wanted to inhale it portions were huge too so we had plenty left over for breakfast omelets in the morning thrilled that we made this awesome decision in our brief 12hour visit to st charles can hardly wait to visit this place again","2756":"my husband and i loved this quaint donut and yep slider restaurant  we stumbled across the first night we were in nola  we wanted a light night snack  their donuts are amazing  they are

highly recommend","2758":"i come to cucina zapata way more than i should what can i say their food is absolutely delicious it most certainly isnt what youd expect from a typical food truck with their flavor packed menu my favorite things to get are the capn crunch tilapia burrito and their chicken katsu portions are enough to fill me up on my lunch break and i always leave satisfied with a tasty meal and a full stomach  around noon is when they are busiest which when youll likely have to wait quite a bit longer than usual but to be honest their food is worth it my typical order is the chicken katsu with an egg on top it comes with a nicely crunched chicken fillet on a bed of rice with some avocado and salads on the side along with the option to make it spicy or not i personally put spicy mayo everything is freshly made each day and you can definitely taste it when you dig in   the workers there are extremely sociable and always greet you with a smile and they seem like they enjoy serving their customers this truck will keep me coming for the remainder of my time at drexel  best things to get  chicken katsu platter capn crunch tilapia burrito bbq short ribs satay tacos thai mango or taro tea wwithout bubbles","2759":"this is our favorite place to eat around town we always get greeted quickly and the staff goes out of their way to make us happy sam was our server and he

so awesome   the food is really good too ive had the cuban sandwich pretzels bratwurst and something else and considered licking the wax paper to get the last morsels sweet little patio overlooking the street and indoors seating too dont let the various doors confuse you there are multiple rooms inside so they need several doors havent been for a movie or music yet but look forward to it","2765":"of course the chicken is delicious but its the customer service that gets the 5star rating suffering from allergies wasnt enough to keep my wonderful cashier with interesting colored hair sorry i didnt get her name from striking up a good conversation about the neighborhood while i waiting for my chicken it was refreshing as opposed to the typical order and wait while idly surfing the internet on my phone hopefully she gets her tips back from the thief that stole them from the jar saturday cause she deserves them","2766":"without question the best bagels in the st petersburg area

to make a reservation from the app just 30 min from when i looked that gave me enough time to jump in the car and make it for my reservation so simple and super useful on a saturday night  first off the modern decor inside the historical building makes for lots of easy conversation there are some really cool old city planning maps and trendy butcher block table tops i loved everything about it   i also loved that when i sat down some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered they are so tasty and have the perfect amount of jalapeo kick balanced with a bourbon honey sauce   the cocktail menu is definitely worth making a couple visits for i got an albees knees and it was the bees knees im not usually a fan of gin but this cocktail was delicious  we ordered an artichoke cheese and kale dip appetizer it was heavenly i would go back exclusively for the dip it was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer   i couldnt decide what to order for dinner but landed on the shrimp tacos and was happy with my decision the corn tortillas were very crispy almost tostada like and the spicy slaw and cojita was perfect i would definitely order them again  i was too full to try any dessert so im going to have to come back the mac and cheese bites are also calling to me so it wont be long","2776":"if youre looking for a glitzy restaurant chain with a bunch of simulated ethnic dishes keep looking this is the real deal only thing close ive found is in miami had a cuban sandwich picky wife had a turkey with cream cheese and strawberry preserves sounds weird but excellent the best ive had north of dade county gonna be a regular stop when in indy gotta like it when the cook comes out and asks how you liked it   the unknown diner digs it","2777":"love this place i will return when we come back to nashville we maybe waited 10 minutes outside and that was it we got  in and out in about an hour food was amazing they service was great","2778":"growing up i lived right by donut drivein  wed go every week after church and my sister and i would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts  having moved back to st louis recently i forgot all about this place until one day my husband said wow that place looks old and i said well go there some weekend it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so i got a dozen donuts for breakfastheaven  i went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding backthey havent changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes senseif it aint broke dont fix it  my personal favorite is the french

donuts  donut drivein dont ever change","2779":"an amazing place to eat love it you could go 100 times and never eat the same thing twice fresh bakery deli pasta cheese  wine room butcher coffee bar amazing sandwiches","2780":"i was visiting nola from brooklyn ny for the weekend when searching online for vegan restaurants i read about cafe bamboo i had a good feeling about this place and i gotta say it was incredible my cousin and i shared collard green wraps sol chickn dinner and bourbon chickn dinner not red bamboo the owners inspiration or any other comprable spot in nyc compares to the taste of that soul food the bourbon chickn was inspirational excellent dessert the atmosphere was very relaxing and pleasant i even went back for breakfast before my flight on monday do not visit nola without visiting this restaurant  veganbluescom","2785":"had this local icon recommended to us while eating dinner nearby the concretes were incredible  enjoy","2787":"this place is a favourite of

of my favorite breakfast places to eat love local food thank you for excellent customer service every time we go","2790":"wow we had the pleasure of one of the best dinning experiences in a very long time  i travel a lot and eat out 80 of the time so i am exposed to many types of dinning scenarios   we sat at the upper bar and had drinks and dinner  lets start with the staff incredible  we interacted with two bar tenders and a few other staff all were extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their role in the org  you can tell that the owners treat and train everyone at a high level   lets get to the food and drink  we had the brussels sprouts and yuca fries to start  both outstanding then we ordered the paella cauliflower and canelones  everything was fresh with unique flavor  the pickled fresno peppers were so good the staff gave me a tub to take home  and because we asked so many questions we were given a tour of the kitchen to meet the chief  thats a first  the beer and drinks were on par with the food  i have zero negatives and will be back","2795":"i dont eat a lot of meat but when i have a dinner party and need something or want to try a new recipe i go here  last night i wanted to get a bone for my dogs birthday i left work early in hopes of making it in time i live around the corner but work in west philly i arrived and they were closed all dark and closed up so i decided to call and see if someone answered perhaps in the back cleaning up so someone did answer and the gentleman said you just need a bone and i said yes he said ill be right there he let me in and i got my birthday bone i thought that was really nice  the men that sell are super nice always pleasant my only complaint would be that you never know who is in line but that seems to be the south philly way","2796":"this has to be some of the best everything i ate here so far mexican food in the tucson area for coming out of a little taco cart man they know how to do it right i know its practically fighting words in this town but id venture to say el nene is up there for best sonoran dog in tucson the bacon on the hot dog is really what shines perfectly crispy with just enough blackened ends to lend the dog that bit of smoke it needs   note this place is cash only  i made that mistake the first time my friend and i ventured from across town eagerly awaiting our chance to try some of the carne asada and famous sonoran dogs only to realize they didnt take cards also i wasnt aware but apparently they won almost won some national contest for best hot dog on a food show of some sort pretty cool   we finally arrived at el nenes prepared cash in hand and ready to go i think there is an atm next door but im principled when it comes to atm fees i got a sonoran hot dog and a few different types of tacos first cabeza is my favorite type taco meat and el nenes does it very well slow cooked juicy succulent a little fatty but i like it that way if you havent ever try the cabeza   now the carne asada some of the best ive ever had to be sure they cook it on a smokey grill out back you can see it when youre pulling up to park behind the tent the smoked lime flavor and tenderness of the steak is perfect they also have plenty of salsas and toppings on their salsa bar to add some zest anyway you see fit tacos also come in varying forms of soft or crispiness i had both a tacos dorados and a regular soft taco i have to say the dorado was the better of the two the deep fried corn shell was perfectly well done   for a little taco cart on a corner in the flowing wells neighborhood i am seriously impressed this is fresh cooked nobologna ready to order authentic mexican food i highly recommend giving it a try","2797":"if you want real cantonesestyle chinese food this is the place to go in st louis  if you move away from the fake chinese food everything here is excellent  my parents who are cantonese insist on going here every time they come to visit    almost all dishes are under 10 so not sure what some of the other reviewers may have ordered  and you are almost certain to have leftovers because of the good quantity of food in each order which makes this a great deal  service is sometimes hit or miss as the core family works there and they seem to hire folks on an off to help as needed  but that is made up for by the excellent food","2798":"dave takes an all american favorite and transforms it into a delectable experience we ordered a daves style and ended up with 3 more love theses dogs great service and friendly smiles","2800":"even though im 2000 miles away and have perfectly good ice cream stores all around i still lie awake at night thinking about creole creamerys butterscotch toffee lavender and red velvet cake ice creams  the texture

night","2817":"cookies are da bomb  i dont need to eat gluten free but if you do this place is amazing","2818":"i haz mad love for this place which is absolutely the go to place if you fancy yourself a mixologist or an alcoholic and even if you arent an alcoholic they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff i had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today they have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint i had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which i was standing in front of sighing knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine a clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if i like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins i should try charles martini cab and a francis ford coppola blend both were amazing and sooo much better than what i had been drinking at about the same price point i had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than frugal mcdougals i also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and dont you judge me people some giant sippy bags of margaritas i dont know why they were on sale and it was pregame time of year as i stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt he said you know what these are good for and i shook my head to indicate not really he then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said  red lights with no cops around it was all the wrong so you know they are clearly my people","2821":"wow just wow  the food was unbelievable  no photo since i scarfed it down before i thought to snap a picture  we got there just before noon and there were 34 people in line  allinall we were there a good 15 min  not bad  everything everyone said is absolutely true  so fresh so yummy  i was a little surprised that the ricechick pea dish was cold everything except the chicken and fallafel were but it was delish nonetheless  for 10 my platter included the most amazing smelling and tasting grilled chicken a rice and chick pea mixture hummus a small scoop of the best fruit salad ive ever eaten some sort of greens and a nice hunk of crusty bread i got the nose  ill definitely go back again","2822":"delicious food and outstanding service from josh he helped make my mothers day extra special by inviting my children to make the tableside guac for me  and my children now cant wait to go back","2823":"since it was our first time gigi let us sample from the menu we settled on the jerk chicken collared greens cabbage and rice the profile picture must be the small platter because we got the large and the food was piled so high the lid could barely close the second platter was for the kids fried chicken mac and cheese fries and candied yams that she threw in for free everything was delicious and more food than we could possibly eat  i enjoyed talking with gigi and learning her and her husbands back ground i loved this food truck and hope to return or visit their restaurant","2825":"dont under rate this place because of its location in metairie i enjoyed the same experience as i did at the french quarter location its great for a social sit down with friends and the quality of beignets are equal in taste i ate two orders alone","2826":"i have eaten pad kee mao drunken noodles at every thai restaurant in the city and i hereby declare that they are best at vientiane  fat noodles that are a tiny bit sweet and oh so spicy if you ask for them hot 14 stars  the staff here are just fantastic at making sure to ask you just how

staff as well as their creative donuts great little addition to the st louis restaurant scene","2830":"thought of having another beer and stumbled across urban south discovered a crazy big industrial hall filled with parents and kids and also pets to adopt it looked like an event to me all benches were pretty much full it was thursday so they had the crabfish stand so we munched on that sooo yummy but also a bit to spicy for this german right here oh yeah they had beer too hahahaa the grapefruit ipa was the best to calm down my tongue great beer and great atmosphere loved it","2836":"this place has been open for 10 months but i just heard about it last weekend  the owner and his daughters are super friendly  the pricing is fair and the food portions are large    i dont eat pork which is what most of their sandwiches are made of  i got the pan con bistec steak sandwich which is probably bigger than a foot long sub and the black bean soup  both were very tasty and filling  i also tried a coconut and cream cheese pastry warm that was good  my friend got the elena ruth and was surprised by how good it tasted considering the seemingly odd mix of ingredients in the sandwich  so 2 sandwiches 2 cups of soup 2 drinks and a desert pastry came out to about 26  a fair price considering these were definitely dinner sized portions of food  they just got a new coffeeespresso machine and were letting us try free samples  the coffee is definitely good quality and better than what the barista with the green apron can make you down the street    we will definitely be repeat customers if you try this place you will be too  this is another great locally owned business in indianapolis  oh and the owner hinted that he would be starting to serve breakfast soon","2837":"my friends and i loved our tour our guide was toni and she was both wonderfully knowledgeable and highly engaging with great stories and a great sense of humor too we had a blast even though we went on a quite cold day ended up at historic city tavern where george and martha washington had a regular table and had a wonderful meal there to top the day off i highly recommend that as well","2846":"this mom and pop grocery store has fresh fruits and veggies at a reasonable price my favorite thing about goekes is their herbs and spice section they have the largest selection i have ever seen and they even have custom blends for marinating and making dips and dressings if you are looking for healthy snacks they have containers of nuts and dried fruits all in all its a cool little store","2849":"whats not to love this place is actually laotion or food from laos which is why you may find dishes slightly different then vietnamese so first off the food is amazing and they are open late everyday until midnight on weekends and 10pm week days there is a shaved milk ice bar which is very good treat while you wait for food or after you eat its condensed milk on shaved ice with choice of many toppings from fresh fruits to weird jelly cubes there is also and fresh ban mi bar which is a pork sandwich with arrangement of toppings the staff is nice and decor is cool","2852":"amazing service carol was friendly and very helpful the food was fresh and delicious felt like i was at home was moderately crowded but no wait for 2 to be seated would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends","2854":"we used the masters baker for our wedding cakeit was gorgeous and so moist and tasty  we got the lemon raspberry and vanilla creme cakes with raspberry filling and buttercream icing it was fantastic we got married 2 weeks ago and the cake is still moist and delicious any time we are close we stop in to get some cake tins","2855":"i just went for the first time and this place is amazing i tried the chicken sandwich and it was incredible hot crispy juicy tender and flavorful all at once i cant wait to try one of the donuts i might go back tomorrow","2857":"probably one of the best middle eastern  mediterranean foods he just piles it on and its just amazing the man knows how to work a cart  tip  you do not get to choose what you get only one item on the menu and its always a little different from the last time  long wait so get there early or later during lunch time  used to be 5 now its 10 i believe  one order per person  cash only  hes a warm friendly guy so have a conversation with him while he prepares your order  you will smell like the food you ate for the next day or two but its worth it  you will have food coma if you attempt to eat it all in one sitting  hes got piles of garlic and flowers on his cart which is cool  you can smell his food cart from a block away","2858":"i dont go there often but when i do i get the fox treat  best to go at odd times to avoid the lines","2859":"great new brewery in the neighborhood took a while to open but glad its finally here very laid back place good service delish beer","2861":"i love tanya  matts i work right around the corner and if it wouldnt make me weigh 800 lbs i would go every single day   they have an everchanging selection of flavors they have a smorgasbord of toppings that you can choose from including these tiny little juice ball things i havent tried them yet but they look really intriguing   ive had cookies and creme peanut butter and birthday cake they are all super creamy and delicious my favorite topping is the cookie dough chunks but they also have a bunch of great fresh fruit   they have boba tea smoothies and milkshakes but i havent tried those yet  i recommend going in the first time so you can check out the selection but they also have a drive thru","2862":"went to this place because of the reviews but definitely going back because of the hot dogs i started with a daves style and it was so good that i immediately went back up and got another hot dog with mustard it may not look like much but dave knows what hes doing   my husband got a pizza dog it had a delicious mozzarella cheese crust with pepperoni and marinara never thought of that but it was sooo good","2863":"swiss haus is my favorite bakery in philly all their treats are scrumptious  the coffee is excellent and the service is consistently friendly and helpful   i recommend the devils food mouse treat and the strawberry pond cake","2865":"best salty caramel i have ever had  you know i love you jeni your shits still splendid but boys in nola got you here","2867":"great little unique place to check out good selection of cocktails and beer i tried the knickerbocker  rum raspberries and triple sec  it was delicious and strong  the food is very reasonably priced and delicious the cuban is wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed the st louis salad my only small complaint with the food was the royal grille sandwich the sandwich itself was great how they got mozzarella and cheddar to be that melty and delicious beats me so creamy the apples added a nice crunch and sweetness the bread was toasted perfectly however when paying an extra 2 for turkey to be added i expect more than one very thin slice i couldnt even taste or see the turkey without deconstructing the sandwich with that being said it was still a delicious sandwich   i think our servers name was andrew he was very friendly and attentive the drinks and food came quickly we were in and out during peak dinner hours on a weekend evening in just under an hour will definitely return when were in the area","2869":"love love love yolklore  cannot say enough good about this place  my friends family and i all stop by about once a week  unfailingly my favorite place to get biscuits and gravy  their smoothie let the beet drop is fantastic  healthy and delicious","2872":"finally got to try the infamous prep  pastry went in with mixed feelings thinking it was all hype no show but damn was i wrong ordered the steak and eggs sand which and an order of biscuits and gravy 5 stars for my sandwich it was simply amazing the tri tip was flavorful but what really stole the show was the cheddar jalapeo focaccia the sand which alone is what will bring me back to try the rest of the menu the biscuits where delicious and the gravy was good   only thing that i wasnt impressed by was the danish i ordered the berries and cream cheese danish and it seemed very plain and didnt stand out what so ever there was another danish that had a cream cheese and goat cheese mix in it so i will try that next time in hopes to redeem the pastry end of this establishment","2873":"i went to sabor del caribe and had a totally awesome lunch today i got the pork chunks and beans and rice and salad and 2 beef empanadas i am never disappointed when i go the food is alway super top notch you will also not find empanadas nowhere this fabulous for i have tried they are alway loaded full of filling and the dip that comes with each one is the total bomb i get the fried chicken as well and it is to die for my lunch was under 1000 today and i have enough for dinner tonight if you have never been here then you do not know what you are missing and should get in you car and drive there hectors food has all the spice a great latin caribbean restaurant should have and you expect and he is a top notch chef like chef hector his food truck is always spotless inside and out and he and his wife could not be any nicer to all of their customers chef hector i enjoy your food and i enjoy your hospitality thanks so much for the great food and keep up the great work  people go see sabor del caribe you dont know what you are missing","2875":"they accommodated our large party really well great drink menu and we shared a bunch of appetizers and entrees  all tasted amazing only downside is the parkingif the lot is crowded there arent a lot of other options","2876":"whats to say about ted drewes its delicious i like the cindermint concrete and the johnny rabbit concrete on friday  night i had the johnny rabbit cherries and chocolate chips yum i took my grandmother and she had the terramizzou she was thrilled and hadnt been there in years go there its delicious","2877":"i never realized how absurdly overpriced the mccormicks spices are at acme until i started shopping here  this place has an asininely complete collection of spices and spice blends that are fresh flavorful and very cheap  the staff is knowledgeable and helpful but i have gotten caught up in ridiculous conversations with the yenta that owns the joint  one revolved around genetic variation in human populations and involved a staff worker insisting that i had african blood in me  please dont buy overpriced spices at the grocery store anymore  buy here","2879":"the best coffee in town makes it hard to go back to sb ever again im a frappe fan but also love the hots and have never been disappointed by the quality they even know what we like and will have my husbands ready before he reaches the window","2880":"unbelievable freshness flavor variety of textures in their bahn mi they are so ridiculously good that we always order extra for the next day and they taste just as good then the pho is super good but traditional so be prepared for surprise meats i think it would be hard to find anything on their menu that is not exceptional very very favorite bahn mi place","2883":"what a cute quaint place  the service was fantastic and the coffee was fantastic  i went with an iced coffee that tasted very nice and wasnt bitter at all  will definitely be back for more","2885":"definitely very pricey for your regular shopping so i prefer to just get specialty items and of course food they make and serve for lunch i also love the fact that they have someone stationed in the wine area  i was there yesterday and got great guidance and ended up buying a great bottle of wine that was very well received by the person i was gifting it to while i was there i picked up some made on the spot sushi  rainbow roll  yum im definitely a fan","2894":"third window brewing company wow really tasty beers they got 6 beers on tab and all of the beers i try was tasty and flavorful with a kick i like all 6 beers that they have and the

year now and havent had one place as a goto for cheesesteaks  went to westtown meat market the other day based on some yelp reviews and was blown away by the cheesesteaks   the quality and taste of the meat was top notch and it was on a great fresh roll    this is our goto cheesesteak place for the foreseeable future  my favorite in the philly area still remains steves prince of steaks but now theres some competition","2897":"cheerful people who know their stuff work here  the place itself is bright and roomie  the array of breads and pastries gives one pause  and while i was enjoying my coffee and chocolate croissant they took an order for a flourless chocolate cake which was to have a layer of raspberry and the top was to be decorated for a birthday  i was drooling  the calm with which they work shows in the taste and look of every item they are closed monday but be sure to double check as you would not want to be disappointed","2899":"as good as it gets for a food truck food court chinese which im sure you know exactly what i mean by that is one of those lunches i just shamelessly crave i have to say this beats all cheap chinese in center city flavor wise not to mention its actually cheaper then all other options for food court chinese shrimp and broccoli egg roll lo mein and a soda all for 6 im in once a week lines are usually long but they move relatively fast so dont be deterred they have a spicy option you can add if youre into that huge portions and super friendly enjoy frugal friends","2901":"i couldnt be happier with this place the food and the service were both so wonderful i had never had a sushi burrito before and was a bit skeptical but it was perfect for me our server kory was the sweetest our table had sushi burritos crab rangoons and my husband got pho which he also had never had before we were all very happy with the people who worked there and the food they had this original spicy sauce that was delicious it had such great flavor

absolutely to die for","2908":"so i meant to just go in and get a croissant or danish here since ive been looking for a decent one here in reno but managed to get distracted and buy a bunch of other

sweet and i 100 will need to go back to satisfy my sweet tooth","2911":"fantastic pizzathe pie is especially good  the house salad dressing is extraordinary friendly owner and attentive staff  highly

way better than it had any right to be if theres a nicer winery in this area i havent tried it yet put this one on your must try list","2921":"ive ate at this fazolis a few time now and the food and service has been good  the food has always been hot and i really like their ultimate spaghetti and baked spaghetti  the restaurant is usually clean but some tables are left dirty too long  on some of the trips they didnt bring out fresh bread sticks but i had enough with my meal  it takes about 1015 minutes to get meal but it is pasta not a deep fried chicken strip so im not sure why people on this forum are complaining about the wait time","2922":"this is my go to spot for a great sandwich everything i have tried thus far has been amazeballs and even though its always super busy i seem to get in and out fairly quickly","2925":"what a wonderful and unique experience this was an excellent excursion wonderful food great service the dessert barbakery is worth the trip by itself wide menu

to tip if paying by credit card before shehe runs your card  if you dont youll have to give cash or have your card rerun to give a tip  oh and rumor has it that they are working on getting a liquor license","2942":"tripped over this place while wandering around the garden district the maple sriracha donut rocked my world and i ended up sharing it with three complete strangers while waiting for

the environment is super cool  not to mention all the servers are really friendly and prices affordable whats not to love ","2951":"great spot for a burger and fries with a full ice cream stand for dessert fantastic local spot in downtown saint louis","2952":"last monday i jogged up the stairs out of the 19th and market green line station and was basically punched in the face by the amazing smells coming from this food truck more than a block away id eaten at the falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose i knew what i was going to be chowing down on that day  the food at this truck is amazing while the meal varies quite a bit from day today there are a few things you can generally count on a portion of delicious hummus some really good falafel a pita or roll a generous helping of some of the best grilled marinated chicken that ive ever tasted and two other items one of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce which is always good the other is often a sauce or fruit item   recently the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line different soups every day and a bottle of perrier with the meal he does not list a price but generally charges 10 which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day   its also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated he is a real character and likes to go on and on about how high quality his food is how difficult it is to get quality ingredients etc he wants to know if you like quality food and if you are willing to pay for quality quality quality quality quality at first i found this a little offputting but now i find it an endearing feature of the experience he clearly cares a lot about what he does and as long as you dont take the conversation too seriously itll be fine    my one major caveat for this place is do not try to eat here if you are very particular about your food he gives you what he gives you and isnt going to be making anything specific to your tastes its also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be  usually its relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot i wouldnt count on being able to get a description before getting served so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting i also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies   that said if you can get past this you are in for a really flavorful meal at a good value","2953":"our 6 year old wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday party he picked out the triple chocolate usually im overwhelmed by the richness and density of chocolate cake this cake was ahmazing perfectly moist balanced sweetness and light icing all our guests and most importantly the birthday boy loved it i cant wait to trying more of their cakes","2958":"always a great time coming here some of the cheapest soft serve in tampa but they also have a variety of other options too such as sundaes which my dad loves   i always get the vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate and it never fails ive been coming here for years with friends and family and i have so many good memories here which always makes it a pleasure to come back   the service is super fast and it was really packed tonight so props to them for getting

fabulous variety of hot foods ready to go as well as sushi fantastic fresh produce and bakery","2961":"provisions has quickly become a local gem and a place i turn to when i need top quality ingredients high end salts the best vanillas chocolates and a whole bunch of great local flours plus ones that would appeal to the gluten free crowd highlight the kind of stuff you can expect to find here cookbooks and some kitchenware can also be found here high end stuff at a surprisingly notsohigh end price","2965":"we had wings and pizza from here and we thought it was some of the best around i would recommend this place to anybody that wants good food we called ahead and it was ready for us when we got there and the service was friendly we will go back again","2970":"i absolutely love this restaurant  having been to many indian restaurants in new england this was definetly a cut above  doing the tourist thing at valley forge and philadelphia we came upon this restaurant by chance  our entrees were great and the indian bread sampler was delicious  we had enough left over for breakfast the next morning and had leftover bread for lunch that day  we were so impressed we made a special trip back out to king of prussia to eat again that night  the owner of the restaurant was extremely nice and took a genuine interest in his customers","2971":"my wife and i toured with wine edventures today and we cant say enough good things about our experience  our tour guide shawn picked us up exactly when he said he would  he was extremely informative throughout the tour telling us about local area history and showing us from grapevine to bottle exactly how wine is made  we stopped at four local vineyards and did thorough tastings at each  we enjoyed many of the offerings and even purchased a few bottles to bring home with us  shawn was also extremely patienthe never rushed us at any of our tour stops and really gave us the chance to try different wines and enjoy the beautiful santa ynez weather    final note on excellent customer service  shawn realized that we had left one of the wine bottles we purchased in the rear storage of his van and called me on my cell phone to make arrangements for delivery so that i returned home with every item i had purchased on the tour  many thanks shawn  if you have any interest in learning more about wine in general or the 110 vineyards in the santa ynez valley then call wine edventures immediately  this is money well spent","2972":"great gyro and pork souvlaki the gyro was stuffed full of very tender meat had the saganaki to start which had a nice texture and mild flavor wed have all of these again   our server was attentive and very friendly add in the free parking and thus place is a home run","2974":"my husband and i stayed at hotel mazarin on our honeymoon  we really found it to be a wonderful place my husband is a paraplegic and is in a manual wheelchair the staff and facilities were sufficiently accommodating to those needs as well as our generlw needs such as directions restaurant suggestions etc  the daily free breakfast is better than most everything from fruit to grits and the coffee is

not only being in a martini bar but also a first martini i was surprised at how many different ones there were to choose from  i was always under the impression that martinis were bland social sipping drinks boy was i proved wrong with this excursion  my choice of a martini yes i only had one was called caramel apple it had vodka and apple sour schnapps and a caramel rim on the glass omg was it delicious  i sampled tastes of friends choices  there was a mango strawberry one one called  a sassy apple a bb in drag bugs bunny bitch  mona and one really delicious one called stacys tea which i believe i will be having one of those the next time i return to this fin establishment  the bar has been around for quite a while however the previous owners earned it a bad reputation for a short while before it was closed and reopened since then all i have heard about it rave reviews and after spending a couple of hours there i am now convinced i too am a fan  the bartenders were super nice and the wait times on the drinks was minimal even considering the large crowd that was in attendance dont worry if your not a martini fan there are other delicious concoctions available and they also have a full regular bar with soda beer and liquor but really why would you have an ordinary drink when you can have something fantastic do yourself a favor and check out absolutli goosed you will be so glad you did","2980":"best burger ive had in forever and easily the best chili fries ever i had the pbj burger did not disappoint","2981":"i totally love the steak  eggs with the breakfast potatoes

our daughters birthday  we picked it up a couple of days before the party and i was a bit nervous that it wouldnt taste fresh it was wrapped up in cellophane plastic and in a box i think this helped the freshness  it was really good and still very fresh the cake was very cute and a big hit the frosting wasnt too sweet and the cake was perfect we got the chocolate with chocolate chips it wasnt too rich and very moist the princess decoration was perfect","2988":"this is an amazing place i had beauty and the beast and it was fantastic the was barely a line which made it even better i will

the best concrete joint in the world nay universe from standard concrete flavors chocolate chip strawberry chocolate vanilla etc to the christy a giant brownie sundae you really cant go wrong with anything you order my personal favorite is ordering a vanilla concrete in a cardinals cap with reeses peanut butter cups on top but the toppings list is endless so dont feel pressured to copy my order in the summer the lines will be around the block but thats part of the experience so bring your dogs your kids your friends and make an experience out of it during the christmas season they sell christmas trees and concretes but will close shortly after until about april an absolute mustdo in saint louis so dont miss out","3004":"i love this little corner shop that puts out some of the best authentic mexican food you will ever eat in tampa the owners take a lot of pride in their service and menu and all is made fresh to order","3005":"i saw this place advertised on show me st louis and

hard as half of the selections were wiped out to me due to food allergies  i settled on a peanut butter and banana with honey as i have never tried it before  it was glorious  everyone if you value my reviews at all then do please check this place out","3006":"nice strong coffee they offer dairy alternatives the coffee shop on kennedy is bigger than the one in hyde park and they have food items their avocado egg toast is absolutely delicious","3008":"kanella is like an orgasm for my taste buds and a rejuvenation of my soul i have been here twice once for dinner and for brunch and both times i left feeling like i found another wonder of the worldthe food service and atmosphere make this place well worth every penny you will spend  went today with my gf for brunch  we started with a large french press of coffee that netted us each 3 cups and an order of the houmous and pita and one of the falafel  we could have ended the meal there and been perfectly satisfied  the experience only got better however as i ordered the english breakfast which includes 2 eggs perfectly fried in olive oil a sausage link piece of slab bacon that still has me drooling baked white beans in a light tomato sauce half a grilled tomato and toast  i added a side of halloumi which isnt on the menu as a side but our waiter was more than happy to accommodate me my gf ordered the cyprus breakfast which was made famous by the best thing i ever ate and added a side of greek fried potatoes    as we ate we could only look at each other and smile because our mouthes were too full and too happy to make

into my favourite place to lunch at   i finally made it down to kanella in the daytime thought the cozy dimly lit taverna style restaurant with albeit consistently mouthwateringly delicious food would loose some of its flare in the am but oh how i was wrong   i admit i was more than a little suprised when i read esquires choice of best breakfast does kanella even do breakfast but when i arrived at kanella around noon sunlight was streaming through the giant windows highlighting the lovely bouquets of flowers and potted plants and upon glancing over the breakfastbrunchor lunch menu i saw the same simple sophiscation and understood why kanella had got the vote  my party of three ate family style sharing the kanella platter fantastic and i mean the best stuffed grape leaves i have ever tried light and fluffy zuccini fritters a nicely dressed salad and more accompanied by the yemen pastry fried yes but utterly light crisp and savoury with spicy tomato salad and last but not least the cypriote breakfast complete with grilled haloumi perfectly fried eggs and lounza a salty hamwow was it all soooo very good   to top it off i indulged in my second cup of the day and was amazed to find a restaurant that offers a strong cup of coffee   moreover i finally met the other owner and chefs other half his very lovely wife who helped serve us and was just as welcoming and warm as her husband  as always i left kanella completely satiated and already pondering my next return","3013":"great classic bbq joint they have all the good stuff you can think of their smoked wings are huge and

good we got some sort of shrimp pasta with cream sauce and it was out of this world  the waiter made me a drink that wasnt on the menu caesar salad was amazing bread yum  who could complain nice decor never been to one before","3020":"this place hands down is the best pizza in tucson and far beyond i have to eat gluten free and they make the best pizza around for the gluten free community the owners are the nicest and kindest people ever they are local owned and operated so if you want amazing pizza and even amazing gluten free pizza while supporting your community head to frescos you will not be disappointed","3022":"outstanding deli the sandwiches we had were all great but the secret might be in the extras that they serve macaroni bites homemade chocolate ice cream and homemade brownies were all killer  goofy and fun stuff made it a great place to go nice playroom for the kids as well give it a try","3025":"coffee and tea done properly first time here and i was not disapointed will be going back","3028":"this just happened to be the closest liquor store i found on maps when i just moved and its the only one ive gone to since the people are extremely nice and helpful  which is great because they have the largest selection ive seen in a while its easy to chose what hard liquor i want no problem but i often switch what type of wine i want and they gave me three subsections and the two i chose were so good  super clean well stocked and great staff  oh and if you need accessories just walk next door","3030":"the food is great and the awesome owner who

you are in san francisco they have many delicious and unique lattes like the orange blossom or the lavender latte the batista was kind and welcoming music is a bit on the louder side by volume but it is not obtrusive at all i would consider this a great place to study","3037":"i love it sweet and bakery pasta all the italian food dishes i love even a coffee section bar a bit of waiting cooking the burger compared to other dishes  but so worth the taste when bring my guests here","3039":"this kroger has been hanging on by a thread for the last twenty years or more the head office is always trying to kill it from inside but it survives like they say it is what it is dont expect everything to be stocked in this small store they have most things one needs or wants i like it because it is just a short walk for me the produce is fresh so is the dairy and hey they fixed the doors and put the in on the right now","3041":"one of our absolute favorite breakfast places  evah located in a strip mall its look can be deceiving but make no mistake ghinis is the real deal we have been here for breakfast and lunch several times a month we have yet to try their fri dinner but that is on our bucket list   there can be a bit of a wait on the weekends for breakfast but they have a nice set up of water etc while you wait the servers are attentive to getting your name on the list promptly the food is well worth the wait  it is always fresh and cooked to order we have never been disappointed i love the florentine omelet and my husband loves the eggs provenale we also enjoy the croque monsieur i find most of ghinis fare to be light fresh and healthy which is what we prefer over heavy carb laden monstrosities  but that is just us my son loves the french toast and heavier omelets   they are a pet friendly place allowing dogs on the patio leashed which we find endearing there is also a bakery right next door  not sure if they are affiliatedpartners  or separate  but we enjoy eating our breakfast and then grabbing some baked goods to take home   its a nice laid back way to spend a weekend morning with a great cup of coffee and good fresh tasty food there is a reason she has been in business 20 years","3042":"they make the best flat whites not to mention their beans are expertly roasted the roaster knows about his coffees and ensures that the beans are sourced from respectable farms","3046":"the filipiniana philippine caf just had their soft opening yesterday and i couldnt have been more excited its great to see filipino businesses opening around town like the pao truck it makes the wait for philfest easier to bare and its fun having new exotic things to try   the cafe sells bubble tea boba halohalo filipino shaved ice drinks filipino coffee filipino baked goods smoothies and more things on the menu are fairly prices and the cafe itself has a modern feel to it   i enjoyed a halohalo supreme yesterday 5 and it was excellent all the ingredients tasted fresh and my filipino friends were definitely enjoying it as well and coaching me on tips for mixing everything together for the best flavor the halohalo has flan in it which is awesome and shows the roots of filipino cuisine in spain   we also tried the ensaymada ube bread 3 which was excellent it is a baked dessert that is stuffed with ube purple yam which is perfectly sweetened the bread itself was soft and enjoyable and could also pair well with some coffee   the location is next to the original saigon deli on waters and dale mabry behind the la quinta hotel its hidden from the road so you should look for the saigon deli sign   im excited for all these new businesses in tampa and look forward to spending lots of time hanging out and enjoy filipino sweets at the filipiniana philippine caf","3047":"im blown away by how delicious my burger was best burger ive ever had and im 55 years old kudos to the chef this place was recommended by someone on my friends flight from houston into st louis we are here for the joyce meyer conference","3050":"this is quite possibly the best grocery store in tucson i mainly just come here for lunch though really they have basically like 3 or 4 little restaurants inside the place where you can get anything from pizza to sushi from their sushi bar and oh they probably have the best salad bar in tucson this is an excellent place for lunch or if you are looking for the best quality steaks or rare imported beer or wine in town","3051":"ive been to baileys range three times and each time i leave happy and fully satisfied the food is amazing and the

wow so good they have several different dipping sauces which is really nice  the drinks they have awesome pitchers for a great deal of their lemonades boozy lemonade who doesnt want booze in their lemonade the ambiance the layout is super fun with upstairs and downstairs seating   definitely check them out for your burger and fry fix ","3052":"great friendly staff store was clean flavors were filled and diverse toppings were filled and clean prices are reasonable floors are clean they offer some nice deals and have coupons there are 8 flavors and 26 dry toppings along with 21 wet or fresh toppings just to be clear they do not charge by weight its a flat rate per cup size i posted a picture of the sizes and prices","3057":"ice cream here is excellent made fresh and you can tell the flavors shine through and taste it their sauces are also homemade and were great","3061":"the food is so good and big variety of meals prices are the best part my recommendations are the popcorn chicken and the crispy calamari so good so home made  definitely coming back and more often","3067":"this place was fantastic the pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things theyre actually made like cinnamon rolls with pizza dough instead of pastry and saucefillings instead of cinnamon sugar theyre amazing  i got one of the daily specials which was puppy drum fish with a side of pasta i wasnt a huge fan of the fish but i think i just dont like puppy drum as much as i expected to it was prepared fine though the pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious  my boyfriend got a dish that i cant remember the name of but it was basically pasta shrimp and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce shrimp diane maybe it was very good i actually ended up eating his leftovers and i might get that next time   the bread is good though very full of sesame seeds so beware if thats not your thing we finished with the tiramisu the flavor was great but the texture was too wet for my taste again its more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong well definitely try the cherrymisu next time which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee   the service was fantastic the place was clean it was easy to park   however my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another ill be back im going to go peel some shrimp i love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners   i will 100 be returning and im already thinking about what im going to order","3068":"my my my i am surprised by all the reviews that were under three stars because this restaurant was a definite hit for me when i used to work at boeing as a contractor  i came into this restaurant at least once a week their gyros are huge chocked full of the gyro meat and their fries are always hot and fresh if you are a christian they always have free bibles they give away in addition to different pro christian charities if you are you not part of the christian persuasion this is easy to ignore simply because of the good food  i am so upset that i dont live close to this establishment though would love to come in the future","3069":"come hungry

banh mi and i will go out of my way to get a good banh mi much to my surprise i discovered a new spot in north wilmington   for me the banh mi thit nguoi is the litmus test for whether i would be a returning customer if youre a banh mi place and you cant get banh mi thit nguoi right then i have a hard time justifying coming back to your establishment   luckily the banh mi i had today was very good the bread wasnt too doughy the pate and cold cuts were quality the veggies were pickled right and the fresh veggies were well fresh like they should be they didnt skimp on the meat either which is always a big turn off   im so glad this new place opened and is not too far from where i live i dont have to trek all the way to philly to get my fix if youre looking for an authentic viet treat this is it","3097":"i ordered carryout i ordered the cubano sandwich which had pulled pork on it and ham it was very good for the price point weirdly enough my favorite thing i had was their collard

atmosphere just grab a pint on benches near the brewing floor  they serve pints and fill growlers but will let you taste anything before deciding what to get i tend to get their whitcomb rye or brugges pooka but they have some great barrel aged projects in the works outliers is one of the best new breweries in the city and im excited to have another hang out on the east side of

obliged to stop and check it out   the first thing you notice is the utter absence of a fishy aroma   exactly the way it should be   the counter help was very helpful   i was looking for stone crab claws and the counter help suggested jonah crab claws instead because they were available and less expensive  the jonah claws were terrific firm fleshed claws very similar in texture to stone crab claws  also picked up a pint of their homemade oyster stew which compares favorably to that of sansom street oyster house   my only quibble is that it needed a few more oysters","3124":"the portion for large was really enormous love that i can mix and match and eat more than 10 different ingredients in a setting","3128":"holy toledo  get in here the traditional lao food is darn tasty everything

girlfriend announces she found a banh mi shop in wilmington skeptical at first i agreed to check it out i was quite surprised by their menu being written in vietnamese which gives me an authentic vibe i glanced at the staff and asked them something in vietnamese and she replied which was rather assuring ive had past experiences where you enter an establishment which claims they are vietnamese and turned out to be chinese and thats another story   onto the food we ordered an original and a grill chicken banh mi very authentic and large in size which made it a very good deal very tasty and stuffed with meats and veggies overall it is my new place for banh mi and saves me the trip up to washington ave in philadelphia for genuine vietnamese banh mi","3146":"my favorite place to get shellfish besides fresh off the pier on saturday mornings it is not just a tourist trap even though you can find it at the end of the sb pier past all the other tourists traps love to get the rock crab deal 25 for a 23lb rock crab with onion rings   my favorite moment  i will never forget the day we tried their california king crab for the first time it was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking sup with paddle sports from the harbor area and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co while on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier after our hour on the ocean we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular luckily since it was early before 5pm dinner rush we were seated quickly the server recommended the cali kings said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh we looked over and there they were being dumped into the tanks they were kicking and trying to climb out   priced at 1795 per lb they came anywhere between 15 to 3 lbs i went for a 2pounder that first succulent bite was heaven and i mean damn that is one buttery heaven each morsel was so large so sweetall of my girls and i were silent with glistening eyeballs staring at each other   after that day i couldnt get that crab out of my mind any chance i could i wanted to go back before the season was over  but be careful a 3 pounder means youre eating a 75 crab only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad for that pricei shouldve gotten both its okay just add a 1 and you can both i guess   besides the crab the oysters are always good and i highly recommend the uni appetizer   okay i really recommend the uni appetizer i usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu its so fresh and clean that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling","3147":"i love this place my husband and i usually have a few beers and a meal once a month since they opened the quality is great and the restaurant is comfortable my husband usually orders the reef donkey and i usually order off of the visiting taps just to see what kind of beers are being made in our area in terms of food i love the hummus the hot pretzel the greek salad the burgers ive tried nearly all of them and theyre great and the pizza i wanted to like the fish n chips but the fish is just bland as heck chefs please add salt to your batter and

about a 5    but the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it  im talking about big fried falafel balls in my mouth  i was surprised to see how busy the place was and the variety on their menu  we had an order of falafelsa little on the pricey side6 for 699but i suppose they were a little bit larger than some other places that i have been to  these were pretty good  the brother had the gyros with the greek salad  the salad looked amazing big chunks of feta and stuffed grape leaf a scoop of potato salad ok this part didnt really look too greek to me but it was good sissy and law and i had the shish kabobs  large portions on the platters  rice beans and a tasty cucumbertomato salad  the flavors were spot on and we

restaurants in mid city this little convenient store does it right if you are looking for a great unaltered banh mi with the traditional ingredients and taste this is the place to be they also have boudin for a good price the dishes are also worth trying but their sandwich is a must try first","3172":"i have to start by saying that im so sad i had not heard about this place sooner  thank you to yelp and the review of the day or i might not have ever known about this place  the restaurant is really cute  lots of seating inside and they have a nice patio to sit and eat outside  now the fun part we start looking at the menu and the awesome guy behind the counter lets us know that its happy hour so everything on the menu is 50 off  what  note to self happy hour tuesday through sunday i think its through sunday 50 off from 36 on dine in only  yes please  so we decided that we wanted to try a few things  we ordered the cauliflower pizza a cheeseburger on a cauliflower bun with a side of cauliflower sticks and a kids order of the zoodle spaghetti  our total 16  i mean  so inexpensive and for all healthy food  heck yes  we grabbed a table inside we were the only patrons in there which made me a little sad because if the food is good and healthy then we want this place to last  we get the pizza first  2 small cauliflower pizzas so we each got one  omg  they were so full of flavor the cauliflower crust totally holds up it was so darn good  i couldnt get enough  then the zoodle spaghetti came out  yum  why have i never made zoodles before  they needed a little salt but thats ok they choose to not over salt or pepper their food because everyone has different tastes  i like that  then the burger came out  it was huge  there was so much meat  we cut it in half to split  now i like my burgers with ketchup or ranch some sort of sauce  there wasnt any sauce on this but man it didnt need it  there was an abundance of flavor  the cauliflower bun again held up so well and that already has a ton of flavor  then the meat was so well seasoned  there were the freshest yellow tomatoes on top  i was in heaven  the cauliflower sticks were pretty darn good i think i would have loved them even more if i had ranch to dip them in  but they were still good  we ate everything and i was so full  thats what happens when you eat healthy    so then we decided that we had to each buy a loaf of cauliflower bread  they are 12 a loaf but it comes with 12 slices  and they can last in the fridge for about 2 weeks i think this is a great deal  we also saw desserts and had to go there  i got a gluten free chocolate chip cookie i mean it had so much flavor a little salt a little sweet its huge and i ate the whole thing  we also had a chocolate muffin i believe it was gluten free vegan and paleo  it had a banana taste and was ooey gooey soft and delicious  i hope this place keeps up the good work on making such healthy food and i hope that people keep coming here  i want this place to flourish  go here get some yummy food and get healthy","3174":"awesome cookie  highly recommend this place  it was the best cookie ever  its in a great location with lots of things to do

individually and catering to our table as if we were the only ones there   i ordered the nachos and mexican corn as my appetizers the nachos came in huge portions and very stuffed with cheese jalapeos etc so delicious the mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy which i really appreciated  the table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal a nice touch chips couldve been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor  i ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too beany for my taste   great service and nice clean atmosphere food is terrific i would definitely recommend","3216":"ive only had the rare steak pho here but it was the best pho ive ever tasted  i will definitely make this

only make the trip on days that i know i have plenty of free time for lunch its quite an experience and the food is amazing ill just reiterate some of what others have already said the cook is a real character so the experience can be intimidating if you dont know what to do   the truck is located on the northeast corner of 20th and market next to an empty lot youll recognize the truck because it will have a long line smoke pouring out of the top and decorations on the front of the truck including plants and garlic the truck wasnt there the first few times i tried to go so im not sure if he goes on vacation at some point also keep in mind that even if the line doesnt look that long it takes a lot of time maybe 5 minutes per person thats in front of you   while you wait in line he will offer you a cup of delicious soup that you should take and enjoy i dont know exactly what it is but it tastes like pumpkin or some other type of squash once you get to the front of the line you dont need to order you just take what he gives you and pay 10 you usually get hummus falafel chicken two side items like rice or grains or vegetables fruit a piece of bread or pita and a drink of the cooks choosing its an unbelievable amount of food for 10 and its all amazing i wish i knew what the chicken is marinated in because its truly the best chicken ive ever had the hummus is especially good too its really creamy i normally eat half of it at lunch and put the rest in the fridge and then go back to it around 4 pm because i cant resist it and youll smell like garlic for the rest of the day so its a constant reminder that delicious leftovers are waiting for you   the cook is actually friendly as long as you dont question the food hell usually make some light conversation and talk a lot about the quality of the food just listen smile and agree and youll be ok","3231":"i went to the screamery today with my daughter and her boyfriend and i was pleased to hear that they are looking at a second location closer to me  the service was excellent  we were immediately asked if we had ever been there and when we said no we were given the run down on how the ice cream is made and invited to try as many flavors as we wanted  the owner also had a conversation with us telling us where the grass fed milk was from and their overall story  i also found out that you can get the game day ice cream at sentential peak brewery which is closer to me as well  the ice cream was rich and decadent  i had the sweet cream honeycomb and the mudd pie  both amazing  the kind that i want to be alone

about this walgreens i have also been pleased with their photo dept i had a small pic from years ago made into a bigger really good great stuff for cell phones and accessories pretty  nice pharmacy   i did lot of shopping here which i wouldnt normally do because the prices are much higher on over the counter but i am in so much shock and grief as my mother just died and i ended up spending  200

quickly by word of mouth  i can only speak for their pizza which is the best on this side of town but their menu consists of salads pasta subs calzones and so on they delivery and do carryout but they

quality but limited and i rarely partake coffee and edibles are served with good ceramicware and glassware  the room and seating are sparenothing soft and cushywhich is fine with me but might not be if youre expecting ergonomic or cushy seating it can be crowded with many 20 and 30somethings in pairs and with laptops and cellphones most people are well bahaved meaning take their cellphone calls outside but even when crowded ive always found a place  exceptional staff  attentive professional and skilled","3261":"the pizza is excellent but this harahan establishment is much more than a pizza place the food service and open hospitality are exceptional the creativity and experience of the chefs is apparent in all of the traditional italian items and the changing daily specials it is a

my wife likes the chocolate custard with oreos  ive honestly never had anything here that wasnt good  they have a sundae that has devils food cake custard and hot fudge  it is dynamite  im always amazed at how busy this place is even when its cold and raining  the staff does a great job of getting through the lines in a hurry  even if the line looks long theres never a long wait  i just wish it would have been nice enough for my wife and i to sit outside and eat  it was too cold so we ate it in the car  this is a st louis landmark so if youve never been its definitely worth trying  we try

early around 8am on a saturday with two kids in tow there was a little bit of a line but it moved along quickly and id say the wait was about 15 minutes long to get in once we got in we were taken

in grilled veggies and meat i ordered the meal with a side of pancakes and those were simply deliciousfluffy and sweet id wait an hour to get into here","3326":"schlafly is a st louis gem with local brewing restaurant farmers market and spectacular events im lucky enough to live in maplewood so i can enjoy everything that schlafly has to offer their beer is fantastic for being the largest craft brewer in town they still keep it fresh and interesting their pumpkin ale is the best ive ever had hands down the food in the restaurant is tasty for brewery food and they have a store area that you can purchase bottles and growlers of any regular or seasonal brew they have when the weather is nice they host a farmers market in the parking lot on wednesday nights which is small but a nice variety of local vendors they also have beer samples while you do your shopping i cant wait to shop their winter market next month which includes more options for christmas shopping i attended the full moon

enjoyable our favorite restaurant in philadelphia  we came for dinner at friday night the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and most importantly the food was amazing we are from the middle east and the food made us home sick in a good way the kanella platter was the star but other starters were very good as well in fact everything we ordered was tasty with the stuffed peppers being the highlight of our dinner  the ownerchef really cares about the customers","3329":"although this is not my favorite place to eat my wife and kids love it the food is always good and they are very consistent with getting your order correct i like the fact you can order most of the lunch menu for breakfast at least once a week i will stop in the mornings and get lunch items for their lunch the staff is always upbeat and it seems customer satisfaction is their 1 concern","3331":"julia was amazing she arranged a beautiful floral arrangement for us on mothers day after finding out that our online order was delayed until may 10 who knew that we were going to find someone so artistic in the flower department at the fresh market   well you heard it first from me because i have been ordering flowers forever from florists and after she put it together she revealed that she had 35 years of experience i picked out the flowers that i liked and there she went meticulously placing them exactly where they should go   and bam in less than 10 minutes it was done it was like meeting the flower whisperer no kidding im definitely going to go there every time i need a beautiful arrangement

grocery chain full of healthy all natural organic choices i could spend all day in this place especially love the homemade choices","3339":"this place is great local feeling and great portions of food servers are nice and efficient this became our go to breakfast place","3340":"i was skeptical to buy polish pierogis at an italian market but im happy i did comparable to the polish market we buy fresh pierogis in detroit they were very flavorful tasty and fresh i will be going back for more and to try more stuff","3341":"nothing bittersweet about this establishment an absolute treasure in the warehouse district the almond petit four and red velvet cheesecake were insanely delicious and i would go back every day if i could i also had an iced almond milk latte and it beat the chain coffee places the cakes looked wonderful and the staff was super friendly go check it out  you wont be disappointed","3343":"opened just last tuesday i visited today wednesday 9915 at 230pm being new they were very busy drivethru had about 10 cars in line so i decided to go inside a continuous line of 6 to 10 people were waiting to place their orders the whole time i was there i got the big box 3 chicken strips biscuit rice and beans and cajun fries chose the bbq sauce for dipping the only thing i would say was a bit overdone was the breading on the chicken a bit too much the sauce was excellent tangy and spicy it was very good the place was clean and the crew was working like a well oiled machine very smooth the wait was not too long finally my wait is over as i was hoping for a popeyes in south county for over 25 years ","3344":"great coffee the really care about what they are serving they me decide what i should have and he hit the mark  ive been there twice now to have their cuban coffee  ask them to put the cane sugar in the with the ground espresso beans  i will be going there everyday during my 10 day stay in philly","3347":"i love these burgers  the fries are pretty good too  dont even get me started on the cheese steaks  try to go during daylight hours  the street is a little on the rough side  fitting more than one baby in there who needs a high chair is pretty tough","3351":"i love the studio every yoga class i have taken there has been unique professional and awesome the teachers are highly trained and each so diverse in their area of expertise also the massages are some of the best ive ever had to complete the experience you can enjoy a fresh organic juice or salad and other goodies downstairs i highly recommend the studio","3352":"love this place the ice coffee is what i normally get here and it is really good what my favorite it is the delicious egg and cheese scramble on biscuit sooo good the donuts look amazing one day i will have to try one","3353":"definitely a good go to burger place the chicken stew they currently have though omfg yum","3355":"after looking at other reviews on yelp i had to come here i also noticed seating seemed limited but we decided to go at an off hour even then it was still busy but we managed to snag a table   i will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on  it is slow i dont think the kitchen is well organized to be honest and they dont encourage take out orders which is why they are always so full   we ordered two lunch combos one with a figo pizza and a caprese salad the other with a margherita pizza and a caesar salad for the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea i wish they had better beverage options   the pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced on par with pizzeria bianco though i say pizzeria bianco is just a little better the salads were delicious but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top on the caesar then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil to die for   at the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato i was given sweet cream my husband hazelnut we thought the gelato was delicious but quite frankly we were completely out of room i think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample or do a special with dessert or salad maybe next time   overall i would say the food was excellent service was ok but slow and the prices were reasonable they do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout time to expand","3362":"i expected to go there try the veggie burger and leave without giving it that much thought  it turns out a place that sells a lot of beef might become the new vegan hot spot of philadelphia  they label their menu which shows they are attuned to the concerns of vegans so they meet the bare minimum good thing they surpass it  for starters get the pickles and slaw bare snack two kinds of vegan slaw the whole thing is fantastic it made the perfect sharing item for a party of three  they also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan the vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions   my wife and i split two vegan sandwiches guadalupe burger and the mazuma tempeh sandwich both were great i especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger no morningstar farms here  for dessert we had the vegan carrot cake the only item we ate that we didnt love i would skip it net time  seriously the meal i just had there compares very favorable to the many great allvegan restaurants in philadelphia i am very very impressed","3363":"i love the concept of this restaurant its cute and quaint inside they now have two locations on central ave very convenient if youre downtown or closer to 34th street  ive gone three times and the first time i got the mini cakes in tip of the shooters of wine it was a unique concept and allows you to try just a bite of different flavors which i am a big proponent for  the second time i got the frose and the cookie crunch cheesecake let me tell you that was phenomenal i highly recommend this  ive also gotten their banana cream pie concoction and this was good as well i enjoyed it but not as much as the cheesecake","3364":"great experience  second time at granite city brewery our server kylie was top notch  great food and drink recommendations service we had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread worth another visit real soon","3365":"if youre looking for a delicious breakfast created by people who take pride in what they serve youll like yolklore were lucky to live in the neighborhood its clean welcoming and fairly priced though theyre known for their egg dishes my personal favorite is the vegan baked oatmeal with either a side of fruit or the potatoes the oatmeal is topped with soy yogurt drizzled with a touch of honey my wife likes the birds nest we never leave without pop tarts for later","3367":"what can i say this place is the perfect local lowkey restaurant that provides consistently wonderful sushi why go anywhere else dinein takeout or delivery they have me as a regular","3368":"was blown away by this place not the highest rated bbq place in town but tried it after a suggestion from a local  i think i liked this place so much because the brisket rib is heavy on black pepper  i like peppery meats and jerky so this peppery crusted brisket was right up my alley  the sides were good and didnt seem like an after thought ribs were tender and fall off the bone","3372":"this place is wonderful we found it today while looking for dedicated gluten free restaurants the bakery is ran by a friendly hardworking mother whos autistic son works there as well and they only employ individuals on the spectrum  the items were all great none of the foods tasted any less as gluten free casein free desserts the cookie dough chocolate cupcake was especially good i really like that they have interesting options too like jalapeo strawberry bread and the owner said they are coming up with new ideas each week and letting people vote on them on social media  the owner went out of her way to be kind she realized that our toddler is also on the spectrum and she invited her to help water plants out front the workers were perfectly accommodating and not phased by our daughter throwing a tantrum on the floor  they definitely seem supportive of the community i saw that their artwork on the wall is only from individuals with mental disabilities they sell autism shirts there as well definitely a great place for the community","3373":"i heart claudios i have just recently been introduced to meat and cheese plates and life is now complete claudios helps me create little indulgent plates for wine and cheese dates with my girlfriends the guys behind the counter are very helpful and even more generous with samples do yourself a favor and try them out youll find yourself crawling back for a fix lol  personal faves red pepper flake soppressata parma prosciutto prima donna omg maytag bleu cheese super strong triple cream brie also ask to try the baked lemon ricotta guarantee you go home with half a pound ","3376":"i love love love trader joes this is my favorite grocery store of all time i wish they would build on in bloomington i only get to go there when visiting family in indy this location is great friendly staff always clean and a fun place to shop   tjs is crazy different from any other grocery store and most people dont know a few things about trader joes  1 everything with the trader joes logo is  gmo free has no artificial coloring has no artificial preservatives  2you can try anything is the store as long as it doesnt have to be heated frozen meals etc you can bring it to the sample station and they will open it for you to try im talking cheese juice fruits ice cream yogurt chips protein bars cereals candyanything  3 they are always sampling items while most stores do this for you to buy things of course they want you to buy it too trader joes actually wants you to try something you normally would never buy  they have so many unique and different foods this lets you try something you may have never even seen in the store before  4 they always have new products this is good and bad because if you are a fan of a seasonal item you have to stock up when you see it  not only do they have certain items that come out seasonally but they are always introducing new items every week  they even have a new item shelf that you can check out so you dont miss anything  again though the down side is they are a small store and if certain items dont sell great you may never see them again  5 you can return anything no questions asked  they want you to try new things and if you dont like it just bring back the receipt or an empty wrapper and they will refund you on the spot  its also good if something you buy spoils fast  6 every store has a mascot a stuffed animal the staff hides it everyday so that kids can look for it  when you find it go to the sample station for your free lolipop  its a great idea and a great way to keep kids occupied as parents shop  those are just some of the main things that set tjs apart  it is such a fun and colorful store to be in  everyone that works there is always in a good mood and there is always someone around to help you","3377":"love this place the staff is super friendly and the food is good i usually order the vegetarian caprese sandwich w asparagus and strawberries on a hot day make sure to check out their icee stand in the back","3381":"just came home from this quietly elegant hotel ideally located in the french quarter steps off of bourbon street my room was spacious and immaculate the service was great and the included breakfast buffet excellent with a constant flow of fresh food right off the courtyard was a great little wine bar patricks bar vin which i highly recommend i would definitely stay here again if i make it back to the big easy","3382":"excellent food beef pancake is a must try along with any of the bento boxes and of course no meal is complete without boba love that that they are open late until midnight on the weekends","3383":"cody and paul made us feel very welcome cody insisted we sampled mostly everything before settling on a sneaky redhead i will definitely be back to stoneyhead great products on offer friendly service and very reasonable prices i was told this place has been in operation for three years long may it continue look out for the sneak attack and the 7 troughs oak attack instructions will be given at the bar","3387":"these stars are mostly the owner tina who was absolutely amazing to me she was incredibly helpful and sweet and ended up talking to me for a long time about my neighborhood and gave me a detailed map to help me find my way around she has a cute little chocolate display with good chocolate and kitschy trinkets that are perfect for gifts to take back to wherever your visiting from its a great place to go because you will leave feeling great after a talk and a hug from tina","3388":"this coffee is so awesome you will want to bathe in it  you will want to stock pile it for the zombie apocalypse  you will probably buy a hand gun to protect your stash from other true coffee lovers","3389":"i cannot say enough good things about bareburger first let me begin by saying that i have been here twice so far and both times i have had the best burger in my entire life absolutely exceptional the quality of their food is top line the best  if you need convincing go to their website or better yet give it a try because i promise they will not disappoint their service is also great but they do get rushes and there could possibly be a wait depending on when you go to dine in the good thing about this place though is you can order to go if i lived in the area i would definitely order out all the time the restaurant itself is very clean its just a little small but its nice and intimate and the atmosphere is fun i would and have driven from the suburbs sat in traffic just to eat here  its that amazing for those who are looking for a vegan or gluten free place to eat this is it and for those who are looking for a delicious meal this is also the place the first time i went with a group of friends the manager stopped by several times to ensure we were getting nothing but great service i could go on and and on and on about how earth shattering their food is but i implore anyone who reads this to go also save room for dessert i know this can be challenging but their milkshakes are to die for what are you waiting for go now","3391":"excellent food  great service  family owned and operated business and it shows  try the white pizza with broccoli rabe ","3392":"one of my favorite spots in tucson   the restaurant a romantic and dreamy atmosphere in a historic train depot they told me at my place of employment to be a womens libber  not rely on any prince charming coming along to take care of me whateverwhen he comes i want him to propose to me at maynards fabulous frenchinspired american cuisine sunday brunch is excellent i love the creamy white polenta  delish now that the weather has cooled down a bit you

and 12 off glasses of wine wells and drafts they usually have a couple of cocktail specials as well on my last visit i was pleased with a cocktail called tequilas dirty sister resposado raspberry habenero shrub grapefruit and bacanora it had a nice kick  the market after a brief construction hiatus although it seemed like an eternity to me they reopened at the beginning of november the first items i grabbed upon their return were sauted brussels sprouts w grapes from the deli case and a bottle of pinot grigio to go good choices im still making my way through trying some of the items in the newly designed market but i have especially loved the croque monsieur madame with a sunny egg and the raspberry cheesecake in a jar if you return the jar you get a 1 off your next purchase available seating has expanded in this new layout with more space to dinein i often come here just for grabandgo meals though i love the take out salads  sandwiches kale caesar superfruit grain portobello wgoat cheese sand etcyum you can also find isabellas ice cream and tucson tamale cos tamales in the freezer  the wine club 2 bottles a month 1 red 1 white 25 off cases free monthly tastings and discounts on wine dinners  60 for a 3 month membership or 230 for the year  the sommelier here is so very warm and friendly check it out","3394":"i get the king soup every time i go it never disappoints great service friendly workers humble  owner authentic food and byob cant beat that the new fruit tarts they serve are a hit also","3395":"have eaten here twice now on two separate trips to nashville and each meal has been fantastic the first trip i got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds delicious the second go round i got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven my son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic get there before 8 am and you shouldnt have to wait in the lines out the door make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well great experience and worth getting up early for probably worth the wait too but im not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip there","3396":"my dad and i went here as we were traveling up the i95 the food was really good and the server was really nice the food came quickly and the cesar salad that came with my meal was almost big enough to be dinner by itself it had a lot of croutons and dressing and parmesan on it which is always a good thing and the vegetable lasagna was delicious and probably enough to last me for 3 days i brought the leftovers with me they also gave us amazing bread one with cinnamon filling and one with cheese filling and there was enough of that to bring the extra bread in the car to snack on the strawberry shortcake i had for dessert was also delicious we also got a pound of cookies from the bakery area at the front and ive only had 2 of them so far but they are really good","3400":"good value and great pizza  we stumbled upon the place last night after a long day of running around with my kids  8  10  kids menu was great  they loved it and a great deal including a drink with plenty of fries left over   i ordered a salad terrific but added a pizza to go after too much temptation  very very good  the staff was very attentive  seems to be family run and certainly putting a lot of effort into serving their cleintele","3401":"one of the best place to eat in the city and region the service is great the food is sooooo good and the decor is wonderful i have been here a few times but this time they had live music witch added to the experience  a place you must go to on the trendy girard ave","3403":"come for the coffee  stay for the music   im not kidding about that i love this wawa i only go first thing in the morning and its a really fun way to start the day  the folks who work there or go there early in the morning are almost always friendly and the music always makes me smile i dont know if its some particular radio station thats on or if some genx manager has decided to craft their favorite mix but at 730am its a party and its awesome","3405":"cant beat costco pricing for bulk purchases you have to use debit or cash unless you have their credit card","3409":"love their latteand pastries  this was a great place i enjoyed my first time so much that it ended up being the only place i tried

been thrilled the guys at shank will prepare your meats for the freezer as well  do yourself a favor and only shop with these wizards","3414":"i decided to try this place after a soup nazi type of lunch experience i had there in the fall aside from the divaness i wasnt incredibly wowed by my meal  i went for dinner with a friend since she had never been to this restaurant as always the decor is awesome i like the clean semicramped feeling   on to the food  i had the watermelon salad and the roasted bell pepper with lentils omg i would choose this meal as my preexecution fare if i were on death row  first off the watermelon salad was ridiculously delicious there were pieces of watermelon some radishes some other vegetable that i cant recall right now and slices of some unpronounceable white cheese those ingredients are kind of exciting on their own but what set that dish apart was the freaking oilbased dressing i dont know what they put on top of that salad but it just made the whole dish come together  the roasted bell pepper was enormous i didnt realize how big and filling that dish would be the bell pepper had some mix of lentils raisins cheese and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft im guessing goat cheese whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically  all told the total cost wasnt ridiculous for both items i think i paid almost 40 usd with tax and tip   given this experience that chef can be soup nazi if he wants","3415":"we used the party room for a bridal shower  the events manager deneva was wonderful to work with and followed through on every single detail  the wait staff was fantastic and the food was exceptional  we will definitely work with deneva for any future parties at cyranos","3416":"stopped by here to get a few appetizers to go there was seating out front and a nice little back patio area and the bar went all around there was live music playing as well i got the gator tail with inferno sauce let me tell you i love love love spicy food but if you dont that inferno sauce is no joke

good   the double layer of taco with different crunch and flavor  perfect  fresh and flavorful and well worth the expense  you dont have a fish taco that falls apart like every other place  and the garnish melds perfectly with the taco great food well worth the price  those that know good food  go   dont pass this up  enjoy","3425":"fabulous ice cream is delish pizza is crispy and the best we

friends dishes and the general impressions i got more so than my own personal taste  so for starters  i ordered the lobster roll the dish was not to my liking but thats because im not a fan of celery in lobster rolls the celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish i also found the lobster overdressed but some of this is just a matter of taste so i wont ding them hard for that  the rest of the food given the price was fantastic the crab and lobster were all fresh all cooked correctly and all at a price that worked   it is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood most are either way too expensive or way too sucky this is not one of them","3450":"oh and if you stick only the donuts you are truly missing out the chicken sliders are phenomenal  meaty savory salty  sweet if they have the fried chicken biscuit when you go you must order it or else you hate america","3452":"awesome find in a strip mall

had a pork sandwich with grilled onions and mojito marinade the pork was hand carved from tenderloins recently cooked with fresh baked bread delicious while we were eating the owner came out with samples of his black bean soup which he makes daily possibly one of the best black bean soups i have tried he then generously brought over some of his home made carmel flan which was so rich it should be illegal but just as delicious as everything else i will definitely be going back here to try more sandwiches nothing negative to say about this place top notch very friendly owner and employees truly feel like you are in cuba","3472":"tried two of the many available and all i can say is wow this stuff they call mead is very good the goober vitis taste just like that childhood favorite in

different flavors  they are filled  she also supports many good causes like autism i have always purchased them from the farmers markets but now there is a great shop i love the train station location thanks betsy","3484":"this is hands down the best place to get gourmet coffee that isnt overpriced its cheaper if you drink your coffee there versus getting it to go and trust me youll want to stay unless youre in a hurry the cafe itself is pretty big and has 2 areas that are separated by the counterkitchen they also have a bar hence the name and a food menu their desserts are generously proportioned and theres a wide selection to choose from my friend and i tried the oversized snickerdoodle cookie which was pretty decent for a standard cookie soft and chewy and not overly sweet the

interstate billboard  cant believe i have never been to this bbq joint great atmosphere enjoyed the turnover and corn casserole  if the whole wait staff work like tyler this place will become my

our first pizza place in philly and we loved it pizza tastes great thickness is perfect i think the best part is the variety they have on the menu in particular the create your own salad option is amazing so many choices and you get a huge custom salad can easily be shared between 4 people wings were also very good as was the blue cheese dressing that came with it  wish there was free delivery

england clam chowder we also got to make a low country boil and cheesy pull apart bread not only was everything delicious but it was interactive and engaging   we had a blast to say the least we plan on taking more classes","3529":"whole foods meets mcdonalds i needed a quick bite chipotle was closed and i decided to try this new place so glad i did   locally sourced menu with photos of the farmers in the restaurant a menu that includes kale smoothies and veggie burgers as well as burgers and sandwiches  i ordered the el guapo chicken sandwich with bacon homemade jalapeno ranch lettuce tomato and onion which was a little too hot for me next time i would try a different sandwich the sandwich was good though  as for the price its the same price as places like panera smashburger and five guys   definitely give this place a chance","3533":"weve been to tarpon springs many times over the years and have eaten at many of the greek restaurants but this one is by far superior  from the

kimchi burger is a great twist on an american favorite i cant wait to return to try their chicken and waffles also if you saved any room for dessert make sure to try their pandan waffles with green

they have such a good selection of flowers for bouquet arrangements  its about 1 a stem but theyve got gerbera daises sunflowers hygrangeas tulips so pretty  i was shocked at all the different things they have in there  they have a section of cool recipe books papyrus cards neat little gadgets for your home  seafood section has ahi steak for 22lb  any place that has ahi steak  wholefoods is the other is a winner in my book since i wanna make my own spicy tuna hand rolls without mashed up ahi    oh be careful if you decide to buy exotic fruits  the rambutans they were selling were 10lb which is understandable since they may be difficult to find out here in tucsonbut the selection they had were alli repeat all brown and dried upthe kind that my mother would forbid us to eat as children  normally rambutans are red on outsidebrown is not a good sign  they have a huuuuuge wine section and the clerk is so very helpful  i was looking for a lambrusco and since they were out of that she helped me find a different italian sweet red wine the adessa  that was deeeelish  the prices of goods here are about 50 cents to a dollar more than other places for the same item if u could find it

everything and its all fantastic  love their experimental menus  people are awesome and friendly  they are very clean as well  you cant go wrong with anything you get  i see a lot of reviews for the tea but the coffee wins hands down   lately i have really been enjoying the short rib tacos  they are great  i really like the curry but its so much food i cant usually finish it and i hate wasting   there is always a wait but its worth it    this is where its at people if there were open on the weekends or had a restuarant id eat there even more ","3563":"this was my first time here and i can say i wasnt disappointed though it was questionable as to whether id be able to get in the restaurant as the door latch mechanism broke and nobody could get in or out a good samaritan diner helped them get the door open finally but it was quite funny   im glad i waited for the door because the food was wonderful great flavors and plenty left over the spring rolls were fresh and tasty and the mongolian bed was spot on not too spicy but certainly not bland the sesame chicken is some of the best ive tasted in years with a great balanced sauce not too sweet and very nicely crisped chicken im

side","3570":"its nice to see a lot more vietnamese restaurants opening in the city especially uptown you can never have too many options mint is located right next to dat dog a pleasant new addition to the freret scenery it offers authentic vietnamese dishes with savory traditional flavors you can find yourself a really good bowl of pho or plate of com ga roti rice w rotisserie chicken here they even offer brown rice as a healthier alternative which i was really excited about the menu also offers some items with a different flair such as the kim chi burger and chicken with green tea waffles which ill definitely be back to try if youre really brave you can try one of their specialty cocktails that contains fish sauce in the mix i love how nicely the decor was done from the chandeliers to the cute tea cups there seems to be a good selection of wine which you can enjoy at their spacious bar counter if youre in need of some down time i had a nice glass of chardonnay and spring rolls

nice guy at the counter to the food quickly being ready the recipe they use for the masala sauce was a little different from and better than the typical one ive had at countless places in different cities over the years the chicken was super tender that dish was the star of the meal the lamb wasnt quite as tender as i expected though not tough by any means and the vindaloo was tasty and satisfying the papadam wasnt quite crisp enough given that it was still warm and clearly freshly made but still addictive overall id say 45 stars will definitely be back many times and look forward to exploring the menu","3573":"definitely a must do for stl visitors touring the brewery was fascinating enlightening and surprisingly free  brewmaster tour was sold out but that gives us something to

to eat that is not a chain restaurant or doesnt have a drivethrough window from the exterior you might think this place does back woods human organ removal late night and the inside isnt going to blow you away either but thats where the negativity ends with this story folks not only are their bagels and other assorted delicacies ridiculously delicious but every menu item is inexpensive and almost

best  i will be back often  i also had a side salad  the zeus  and it was really fresh and tasty but i do have one small piece of advice  the veggies needed to be sliced a bit smaller  i love the big fresh veggies but they were hard to eat without taking the time to cut everything into smaller pieces which is not great when youre trying to have a fairly quick and simple lunch","3603":"discovered say cheese at the running of the santas  this is a place i will definitely be following   the say cheese is delicious with perfectly done grilled cheese the slight saltiness is perfect with the gouda

great variety of delicious seafood  the shrimp roll is amazing a toasty brioche bun filledand i mean filled they dont joke aroundwith delicious fresh shrimp that pop in your mouth with every bite  the

stories i feel like i had a cultural experience as well as great food that tells the story of the town history thank you pancake pantry","3678":"i dont generally consider myself to be a huge fan of candy  give me a slice of chocolate cake or a donut and im in heaven but candy i can usually take or leave  that is i didnt consider myself a huge fan of candy until i was introduced to the work of souther candymakers and in particular their rum praline  is it traditional  i dont care  adding all of that brown sugar and pecan goodness to the flavor of rum is a stroke of unmitigated genius  we stopped three times in a five day period and took home many many of these little lovelies to the folks back home all of whom raved  i also tried their regular praline which in the rather narrow band of praline flavor was very good  the sweet potato brought in cinnamon and a surprising bit of sweet potato flavor  but neither comes even close to that rum praline  it was disappointing to my bank account to find out that they ship all over the us too  in lieu of flying back for some ill be availing myself of this service very soon","3681":"excellent brewery  always a wide selection of small

taste awkward or forced  even the kiwi gelato was delicious  have you ever tried adding kiwi to a milkshake  dont  let the flavor craftsmen at frost handle it for you  they wont disappoint  the creamy gelatos and refreshing sorbettos are all great  i have literally sampled every single flavor they have to offer except the diabetic flavors i want sugar in my dessert  the fruity flavors taste light and vibrant while the ones that you would want to be dense are so velvety and rich cheesecake tiramisu etc    the service is always friendly and eager to help  the bathroom is spotless and even the outdoor seating is regularly checked on for cleaning  the inside is sleek and modern  my only gripes would be the price and the seeds in the blackberry cabernet flavor its still delicious the seeds are distracting though  its not as cheap as dq but it is much better  it is also much cheaper than cold stone but more satisfying  its impossible to leave this place without a smile  easily one of my favorite places in tucson for any occasion","3686":"i travel to and through st louis a few times a year and ted drewes is a muststop always a big crowd but the friendly staff know how to move the

distance from my house","3707":"this is not my neighbourhood liquor store and i didnt just stumble in one day i on purpose sought out sherbrooke after it came recommended so many times by friends and acquaintances  the beer selection at sherbrooke is seriously unmatched by anywhere ive been in the city or in calgary where i used to live actually i love the way the shelves are organized and how full they are whether i am searching for something annoyingly specific or just kind of want to pick up a bunch of new single pints to try sherbrooke is always always the first place i think to look this is also now a destination of sorts when friends and family are visiting gone are the days where we spend our days at popular edmonton attractions now its pho down the street then beer shopping at sherbrooke sorry mom i have also been told that they label their vegan wines though i am much more of a craft beer girl myself so havent really perused","3709":"ive driven past this restaurant literally 100 times today we decided to stop for lunch after our excursion at lowry park zoo from the getgo you can tell the owner and staff take pride in the location landscaping neat parking lot clean and fresh paint on the building all signs that the restaurant is producing a profit which means theyre filling the seats our server was very good she was busy but never forgot us always pleasant and always smiling helpful and informative we were seated promptly drink orders taken with a feta appetizer on its way it came with fresh tomatoes cucumbers onions seasoned to perfection and with the best feta ive ever had at a restaurant it had superb feta taste but was very smooth almost soft very delicious and plenty of it to eat with your meal if you wanted we ordered our meals i ordered a chicken gyro with a greek salad my wife ordered an eggplant parm sub and we got the kids meal ham  cheese sandwich for my daughter my chicken gyro was exactly what i expected tender chicken seasoned with dill and oregano the tzatziki had a good garlic bite the tomatoes and onions were fresh overall a very good wrap the only suggestion i have would be to serve it wrapped instead of open faced it makes it a little difficult to eat the salad was very very good they didnt skimp on the tomatoes and cucumbers plenty to enjoy on the salad the homemade dressing was not masked with sugar it was a thick greek dressing with herbs that brought out the taste of the salad didnt overpower it i highly recommend it the rice served with the gyro was so tasty it reminded me of the rice i used to eat in the old greek diners in new york very moist and full of flavor i sampled a bit of my wifes eggplant sub it was very well made toasted roll skinned sauted eggplant with a very flavorful sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese she thoroughly enjoyed the meal with such hearty portions she had plenty to go home with my daughters meal was the one that spoke volumes to me many restaurants use the kids meal as an excuse to put together a sub standard sloppy basket of fries with a sandwich that you never take home because the dog deserves better this place made a kids meal that was really a meal we ordered the ham  cheese sandwich it came with a hearty helping of their delicious fries tasty ham quality cheese on another one of their toasted rolls all under 5 youre kidding right way to go stefanos for being one of the very few places to serve a delicious sizable kids meal on a budget all together an incredibly good place to eat for a mediterranean meal we will definitely be back pricing was very fair especially considering the portions we brought a lot home go to stephanos you will not be disappointed","3713":"i am in town for work and a few of my local counterparts brought

healthy  we especially liked their white and red cabbages fresh veggies and their hot sauces  both the mild and hot sauces seemed equally hot so use with caution  the falafel was freshly fried and it

been before i venture in the door  was in ofallon il last monday night and finished about 9 pm so a friend of mine and i decided to try cheddars on route 159 in fairview heights il  walked in at 9 pm and there was still a 30 minute wait for a dining room table even on a school night    so we decided to sit at the bar for immediate seating  best thing we did  jessica immediately made us feel at home and helped to explain their concept and certain dishes that she enjoys  i had the cagen chicken with black beans and chopped tomatoes    sounds rather boring but the taste was amazing  and the entire dish had only 490 calories  jessica suggested we try one of the 99 desserts  i had the strawberry shortcake and it too was amazing  cant be the price right  so when it came time to return to ofallon il last night  we had to go to cheddars  we walked in at 930 pm on a saturday night and it was full but we also ate in the bar again this time  we walked in and a server we used to have at chavas in soulard is now working at the bar in cheddars  great to see steven again  had the same exact dishes as we did monday night and i cant wait to go to cheddars again real soon    my only complaint is that the restaurant is beautiful    sometimes the food takes a long time one you order to get your order served    and the lighting is too dark with the dark woodwork in the restaurant  they need to retrofit their halogen lighting to led mr16 bulbs  can you tell im in that business  lol  love cheddars and cant wait to go again    but sit at the bar for immediate seating","3787":"kanella is an excellent greekcypriot restaurant i have been there multiple times with both family as well as friends and each time i continue to be impressed the dips of the day are

the week i have always wanted to make a visit to see what the cafe offered and what the ambiance was like when my partner and i visited on 042211 we were not disappointed   it is set in a beautifully restored train station full of charm and warmth and if i were to run a cafe i would want it to be something similar to this   the food was amazing and the ambiance was fantastic the wait staff was nice in particular our waitress christina  very efficient but not overbearing she always made certain our coffee cup was filled and engaged in conversation and was quite funny she was wonderful   the

bacon or dont add bacon  thats about it  pick your toppings add fries or cajun fries and youre good to go    i always get the bacon double cheeseburger because lets be honest as soon as i set foot in the door the healthy aspect goes out the window so why not get the worst item for you on the menu  the cajun fries are the best and they come in huge portions  all the burgers are handmade and you get to choose as many toppings as youd like for no extra charge  definitely an a in my book","3809":"this bakery is a hard find but they offer the best bagels around philly the bagels are soft on the

when i was in vegas loved it and was talking to a friend about wishing we had them here she said the closest thing was five guys and she was right  i went on a sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was busier than i expected it to be there seemed to be a little bit of organized chaos going on behind the counter but they must have their system down our food came pretty quickly  now all the burgers come with two patties as the standard so if you only want one order the little burger name i had a little bacon burger my husband had a regular sized bacon burger we and shared large cajun fries  everything came to 18 holy moly yum just delicious kind of indescribable actually which is a little funny for a fast food burger it was just so fresh and juicy and actually tasted like something rather than a slab of cardboard with ketchup on it the cajun fries were nice too although i still want to try the regular fries sometime even though i got a little burger i still couldnt finish it  i wish there was a five guys in edmonton but for now ill have to settle for hitting this one up when im in shpk sure its more expensive than regular fast food but its also way tastier","3816":"great

with a bowl of clam chowder which was amazing they had giant clam pieces and plenty of it i also ordered a shrimp ceviche with a corona great size with lots of shrimp and chips as well there is cabbage at the bottom of the bowl so dont be shocked when you first see it one star taken off because we had to ask for salt and lemons twice before anyone got it to us oh and the outdoor tables are definitely waiting for especially around the time when the sun sets we got to see sea lions and even dolphins great relaxing atmosphere","3828":"where else does the hostess walk you to your table with a basket of fresh hot rolls  cinnamon butter i have no clue but these guys do bucket of peanuts on the table along with an empty bucket for the shells reminds me of topekas   their menu shows the calories for each meal item too our server was polite and detailed when reading our orders back answered all our questions too i ordered the grilled salmon and told him to put the lemon pepper butter on the side because i hate lemon pepper with a passion mike ordered the beef tips with rice  gravy on the side my salmon was grilled perfectly with a nice crisp to the top and was so moist inside i asked for a side of bbq sauce so i could dip my salmon in that instead it came with two sides so i got the steak fries  steamed veggies our server informed me the veggies also came with the lemon pepper sauce and asked if i wanted them without so my veggies were steamed plain which worked for me the entire meal was amazing im terrible at cooking fish and have made myself sick the last time i cooked salmon so i said id rather have the pros do it for me  my husband was given two sides of gravy with his beef tips so he slide the other to me to dip my steak fries in and its so much better tasting than ketchup try it and tell me the only thing that wasnt tended to was refilling of our tea and water another server asked us if we wanted more to drink after our check was delivered she brought out a to go box and put drinks in to go cups for us too other than that great experience","3833":"wow   what an awesome cuban i was googling places by my work and thought id give it a try 10

the best experience ive ever had at a restaurant the facility was near spotless the food was amazing and the staff was friendly i had some fried ravioli and some buffalo wings the root beer is

ceases to please their whole look and feel and belief system is awesome   theyre big on recycling so all their locations are made up of old torn down barn parts including the tin ceiling tiles the chairs tables most of the decorations etc i love their take out menu its pocketsized and really cute with a great selection of items that are all made to order its a little harder to follow that their dinein menu but even their dinein menu can be a bit overwhelming to follow my favorite topping is the chickpea onions its just shoestring onions dipped in a chickpea batter and fried to a crisp goes great on any burger the appetizers are really pricey and are only really worth it if theres a bunch of people eating good for groups the pickle and slaw appetizer is a good one to share the sweet potato fries and other side items are just enough  my favorite server there is heaven who always knows just what to recommend and is very charming in her presence my friends love having her wait on us she is always smiling and keeping things upbeat the bar staff are a great group too they are always willing to mix drinks up together for you i always mix the iced teas together which are all really good with a little agave    seriously loving the philly location wish they stood out more its dark from the outside and pretty easy to miss even with the marquee sign outside the space is great love

the perfect spot at the end of the pier  we came at around 1130am which was perfect because we beat the big lunch rush  we were seated within 15 minutes so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited  youre also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you dont feel like waiting   we were seated outside so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier  it was beautiful    the four of us shared a pitcher of hefenweizen which paired deliciously with all of the food to come  light refreshing and the view was a big plus  and the whole pitcher was only 18  we started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the morrow bay oysters and kusshi oysters  the morrow bays were bigger than the kusshi so i expected a saltier less sweet taste  it was actually just as sweet and the smaller kusshi oysters  i was pleasantly surprised and these were both very fresh    for my main course i ordered the half maine lobster which also came with onion rings and a soup i went with the lobster bisque  the half maine lobster was super fresh and tender  the tail was a little chewy but better than a lot of lobsters ive had lately  my favorite part was the super meaty claw  it came out of the shell beautifully with ease and melted like butter in my mouth  i didnt even need the side of melted butter  this dish was simple and sweet  the lobster bisque was good but nothing id be craving  i hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it but i think they just used lobster for the flavor  oh  the onion rings here are amazing  light crisp and flakey  my friends ordered the lobster roll and the rock crab claws the rounder shaped claws with the black tips  the lobster roll looked amazing and it wasnt super drenched in mayo either  i noticed that my friend didnt eat the roll it looked pretty basicgrocery store bought  it would be nice if they used a buttery toasted baguette as ive seen in other restaurants  the rock crab claws were fresh and meaty i must order this one next time    overall we loved the food and ambiance here a perfect ending to our trip ","3892":"i had really amazing meat

5pm on a saturday night and the wait list is not long maybe like 4 people ahead of us on the list you get to choose to be seated inside or out we chose both 20 mins later we noticed the list filled up fast the wait is longer if you want to be seated outside the food is great only one unisex restroom available inside","3913":"the ice cream was great but i was mainly impressed with the service lonnie love was upbeat positive extremely professional and went out of his way to give us a nice experience had to write this review so his bosses could know he did great","3914":"great place to brunch the food is so damn delicious and the biggest perk for us is parking there is indoor and outdoor spaces available but we always do the outside in the summer the  view from the patio in the back is great bc you overlook kelly drive and the river","3916":"my new favorite ice cream spot the mexican twinky is amazing this will not be my last visit they have water based as well as cream based  so if you want a guiltless treat as my husband did you can go with one of their fruit sorbets  our little girl got the strawberry cream and it was really good also much better than your average strawberry ice cream staff was super friendly and the store was very clean and bright  great spot","3917":"still new to the area but found this place and it reminds me a bit of home im from seattle the food is delicious and you can taste how real it is as compared to something like panera so far ive had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and the southwestern style chicken salad and a chocolate croissant would recommend them to anyone quiet and out of the way im planning on this being my new study spot","3918":"epic some of the most amazing ice cream i have ever eaten they give you free taste testing of every ice cream they have available for purchase on miniature spoonfuls you almost feel bad after trying so many to find the exact one you want","3924":"amazing this was my second visit to st louis for thanksgiving but my first time here i got the pumpkin pie frozen custard and i was expecting just the pumpkin flavor after a few bites i found actual chunks of crust mad good it was a little out of the way from clayton but definitely worth it my only regret was that i was sharing with my husband and i should have gotten the largest size possible","3926":"the fountain is a wonderful place for lunch cocktails ice cream sundae or all three  decorated like an old fashioned artdeco upscale old school ice cream parlor making the most of an old auto dealership the food and drink are amazing  i had the highhat egg salad sandwich with brussels kale cup and a midtown mojito and topped it all off with the black cadillac ice cream sundae which is black cherry ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream served in an oldfashioned tulip sundae glass","3930":"love this place  the ironic thing is that this restaurant is in the meadowood mall food court and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the reno area  the first time we tried it we loved it so much we went back 2 days later  we have been back a few more times since the shrimp scampi is absolutely delicious and the fish tacos are the best my husband has ever had  cant wait to try their fish and chips which seems to be their signature dish  around the holiday season they were even selling their wild caught alaskan cod frozen by the pound to take home i dont know if they do that year round  it was 795 per pound which is a great price  love the place and we will be back","3933":"great food great customer service small little authentic taco joint with all the fixings so many choices to choose from and you cant go wrong with any choice you make i think ive had about everything they have to offer i love the elotes cup and the sopes you must come here oh everything is made fresh","3936":"once upon a time in the dusty town in the badlands of tucson there was a taco truck on the corner of wetmore and a wet canadian they had a hotdog that had been hand made by angels from heaven that sing songs of magical enchantment until the drones of other sonoran dogs are just considered devil songs the food here is just like waking up from a long awaited nap after the heat of battle no more local hot dog chains made famous from a lackluster food networkjust locals bringing the heat on from a truck made from dreams   in this dream i will make this simplei work very close to this place i have been here many times over the last few years so they are consistent in their quality there are other place in town that people think are the best for the famous sonoran hot dog this place is king of the sonoran dog no one can touch themkings  like mama said knock you out kings asada tacos carmelos condimentsall of it is legit come heredont mind the dusty parking lotthis is tucson you are allowed to have a concealed carry and the right to super dank mexican food","3937":"awesome atmosphere and even better pizza  owner served us and was a gentleman checked in on us regularly and made sure we were well taken care of would highly recommend to anyone in the area","3939":"how cute and quaint is this place not to mention they had the sweetest staff we came here with our baby in a stroller and they went over and above to open the door for us and to make us feel welcomed and to help us the little stairs they have the bomb coffee its an allaround yes","3940":"skip the cronut had it and its fine but the real strength of swiss haus is that it is a good bakery in center city it seems the trend around cc has been specialization  cupcake shops galore frenchitalian pastries etc all  having their place but sometimes you just want to have a real bakery as a bakery is intended  cakes cookies pies swiss haus has all of these and more and they do them well their cookies are great especially if you need a last minute snack for the office  who doesnt love a box of cookies sitting on the conference table everybody working there is very friendly and helpful too and the place is clean and the display cases look great  i highly recommend swiss haus if you want to get back to basics","3942":"ajs has some of the best brick oven fired pizza in tucson ive tried virtually ever pizza place in this city and i can tell you ajs is in the top 3 places they use a mozzarella cheese by a company called grande that is a true cheese to the name mozzarella very chewy and slightly oily but accentuates the rest of the pizza superbly the 16 pie is only 1300 which i felt was more than reasonable for the amount of toppings and cheese that is put on it","3944":"i didnt know this place was just beside of the drug store small bakery but nice atmosphere with great worker breads are look so fresh and good","3953":"i went in for a quick donut run around 5pm the donuts were still very fresh and not stale there were many unique donuts to choose from so i went with an almond joy vietnamese coffee chocolate sprinkle and cookies and cream all were fantastic id be back if i lived in the area ","3954":"cool little place that has amazing cookie dough it tastes just like real cookie dough but is made without eggs or dairy chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy theyll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like 1 scoop is more than enough you can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream it stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day love it staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questions","3955":"i just tried this place for the first andthe cupcakes and banana pudding are insanely good   the staff are friendly and so nice  please please dont every move out of the city stay right where you are

delightful little nook we were greeted warmly and had a nice long chat with the barista the food was exceptional and was just the right amount of food not too much or too little this place is where you want to be on a slow weekend morning","3966":"im bummed i didnt review about this bakery right away i cant remember the exact cake i got but it was amazing it was some chocolate strawberry concoction with cheesecake in the middle we left it out on the table for about an hour and yet when we finally got to the cake the cheesecake part was still chilled enough to not be mushy it was absolutely scrumptious ill definitely be back to get more in the future","3968":"this is a cool little place there is a small gift shop with pieces made by local artists they accept donations for those in need and the decor is fun and friendly there are gluten free options as well i had the raspberry hot chocolate with a banging oatmeal raisin cookie there is a small area for children to sit and playcolor this is definitely a family friendly place we usually do lunch somewhere else in town but now that we have found this gem this will be our new desert spot","3970":"had heard fantastic things about bff and could not wait to try it needless to say it completely exceeded my expectations   im by no means a picky eater but convenience is unfortunately the primary factor of most of my eating decisions and bff makes is easy to eat very healthy very conveniently   i got four meals two steak and two chicken fuel packs and they have all been fantastic so far   chelsea behind the counter was very helpful and informed me you get a free sauce with the purchase of a fuel pack the meals also come in reusable food storage containers which is also a nice touch  they will be seeing a ton of me in the future","3971":"yum yum yum so many flavors to choose from the best frozen custard in town  dont be discouraged by the long lines the people who work there are so efficient that the line goes really fast  the only worry i have is that both entrances to the parking lot are right by the stand which makes it pretty dangerous for people who are standing around eating their treats if the entrances are by the far end of the lots thatll be better we always park on the street instead","3973":"thanks to erin m i am addicted to their burritos at 5 its hard to find a better deal around ahem chipotle ahem and their burritos are flavorful and filling i can make one last for 2 meals if im not starving i usually order the tofu verde since i enjoy the level of spice in the sauce","3975":"my family and i came to visit reno for a weekend and we came here two days in a row because it was just that good the first night we came in looking for some good boba and a crispy chicken snack and boy did we find something much more this place does it all with their taiwanese snacks my dad told me it reminded him of actual taiwan because everything was so authentic   we ordered the crispy chicken snack the clam soup and some green bean smoothies and it was just amazing  the following day we came back for the braised pork and egg rice the beef noodle soup the green onion pancake salt and pepper chicken wings and some more green bean smoothies definitely didnt disappoint the second time around either ","3977":"love this plays  the owners and the variety of wine  great atmosphere and ohhhh those red wine brownies from the farmers daughter yum  its nice to find a great place with music on a sunday that has you enter as customers and leave as friends  absolutely cant wait to go back","3978":"whose ever momma they have chiefing in the back i want to hug herlol i was skeptical at first due to google reviews vs yelp reviews and uber eats rating however i was pleased that the ribs were very tender and flavorful mac and cheese wasnt the kraft with the watery cheese if any another winner and the yams taste like love was in em im glad i took the chance i know you cant please everybody and some people are just unbelievable with their expectations the customer isnt always right sometimes they have bad taste buds i will definitely be ordering from them again","3981":"big respect for baileys range for keeping the beer selection local as a craft beer hunter i am usually happy to find 1 beer on a menu that i have never heard of today my mind was blown as a traveler looking at this tap lineup i have seriously only seen 3 of the 30 beers they have on tap i wish i could spend a few days working my way through them if you love beer and your traveling through st louis you need to come here the food is great too","3982":"im writing this review based on the young lady who helped me taylor i used the wrong name in my check in at any rate she had the most pleasant positive attitude for 845 pm initially she was cleaning up and when she noticed me she immediately stopped what she was doing to help me she noticed we had the same bank card and we started chatting about that i learned that this was her 1st job and a lot of the lessons and take always  she learned while working in food service i was impressed as i have a 17 year old and i know how challenging working with the public and food can be she did a phenomenal job engaging me with a smile and great attitude based on her interaction i would come back to this panera  sorry i cant speak for the food i actually was getting a to go order for me daughter and tasted nothing check them out","3983":"great atmosphere in the store great flowers wonderful produce all kinds of specialties the only weak spot is the prepared foods although the sushi is fine","3987":"amazing food great staff its a great environment for a great price i highly reccomend everything on the menu we had amazing red beans and rice as well as the gumbo the mac and cheese was tasty and so was the gator on a stick which is in sausage format","3988":"very nice lady working here  very helpful to two outoftowners looking for special mementos","3989":"great great breakfast start to finish candied pecan smoked bacon sweet cream pancakes and fleur die lis omelet","3990":"was introduced to range sometime ago after a drunken night on a quest for food range is local down to the beers 30 taps of local brews from the likes of schlafly 4 hands perennial 2nd shift and civil life start with a local beer just do it heck have a few theyre all great no beer for you you say fine have an adult milkshake like the bacon shake or horchata shake the bacon shake is life changing and quite possibly better than some of the sex ive had and yes that quote is from a friend of mine ok so onward to food the burgers here are not your typical bar burgers if you want something off the norm then youve come to the right place try any of em ive yet to be disappointed by any of em order the fries with the spicy ketchup or order the giant grease bomb onion rings so youve had a different burger now finish it off with some home made ice cream the salted caramel ice cream is superb for beer floats staff is always super friendly here it does tend to get busy around peak hours and on the weekends so plan accordingly","3992":"how can you not like ted drewesi live about a mile away and try not to overindulge i try to stick with the basic scoop in a cupi just like the ice cream sometimes i get a root beer float if im thirstly definately the best ice cream anywhere","3993":"its a mandatory stop besides the klller product im deeming it as excellent customer service i called canulis months back in my first attempt to understand how the korean bbq meat bulgogi was created i was extremely lucky to talk to jerry who told me what meat to use and what would be cost efficient he sliced down a roast for me wrapped it separate and gave it a little citrus spray i took it home to make the bulgogi ive used it for cheesesteaks and pepper steaks also its unreal the fact that they will slice it for you is a gift but mainly i understand its labor and he volunteered it which simplifies to excellent customer service i have incorporated the house of pork into my freezer stocking ventures with that being said its time i also recommend what most people know or if they dont they need to they are famous for the sausage its hands down the clean up hitter in the lineup on an allstar block of great italian foods i was first introduced to their hot sausage at a dinner party and my friend advised me of the location which ultimately set the wheels in motion its amazing what also is amazing is the breakfast sausage the real deal its absolutely unreal and ill go one step further to state that i am not really a sausage fanatic i highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to make their sauce or gravy turn heads or their in laws happy morning guests 1010","3998":"brunch was delicious  breakfast foods were all top notch and the prime rib was excellent  70 for three people and worth every penny","3999":"great concept and great food the service is amazing as well every staff member we came into contact with was a complete joy my boyfriend and i follow the keto diet and this place has lots of tantalizing options make sure to try the guacamole with bacon chips the bacon just melts in your mouth the angry shrimp is equally delicious i could eat those cauliflower grits every single day they are so creamy and ketopaleo approved the ambiance is cozy and inviting as well perfect for date night or a quick bite","4000":"this place is a little slice of heaven fresh and homemade cheeses pasta pastries sandwiches as well as a ton of homemade food to take home huge wine selection i cant say enough good things about mazzaros i go at least once a week the first time you go can be a little overwhelming because it is usually very busy just ask someone who looks like they know what they are doing and they will lead you where you need to go","4001":"i was looking for somewhere to go for lunch on a healthconscious flavorful sort of tip and i most assuredly found it this is one of the now two vietnamese restaurants ive crossed in new orleans with this particular style of lemongrass chicken the other being in gretna to which i kinda hate to traverse and i thoroughly appreciated it had it with rice and i enjoyed two fairly interesting drinks with it though i can only currently recall the names of them while looking at the menu my fault bad shortterm memory back in taskthe plate had enough food on it to eat twice if you eat moderate meals and the prices are extremely modest especially considering the area and the style of foodfrankly there are far less flavorful options for steeper fare so the fact that it was happy hour was only the cherry on top only spent about 27 before tip had a bit of conversation since it was a little slower and i thoroughly enjoyed myself in every way i smiled from the time i entered and was immediately greeted to the time i left and got into the car where i checked in and began writing this review in my time there i didnt get to try the muchlauded whiskey sunrise about which most of the visiting yelpers have previously raved but the other two cocktails i purchased were enjoyable and its more than safe to say i will definitely be back with company to try it out","4002":"wings are amazingly flavorful i love their beer selection as well i would say the only negative is how small their menu is theres little to chose from and you cant always get the same thing depending what day you go or what they have on the menu that day but owner is very friendly and helpful","4004":"love the brewery great atmosphere fantastic beer a little on the pricey side but worth it really wish they had more options when filling the growlers but i still give 4 hands 5 stars because their beer deserves it cheers","4005":"fantastic food great environment to just shop enjoy a gelato or sit down for some authentic italian they have ready made pasta and pesto theres a different option for each day of the year love love love this place wish you would be open on sunday","4006":"i love this place reminds me of the cafe that used to be everywhere throughout reno before a certain seattle coffee store popped up on every street corner lol the price of everything is genorous considering the quality of the drinksfood available perfect spot to relax and meet up with friends","4007":"best coffee in town  in  broadripple across from monkeys tale friendly servers","4008":"a bit tough to find and only open seasonally but oinks is one of the my favorite bbq places  a friend of mine will drive from an hour away to pick up some baby backs and chicken  the chicken is some of the best that you will have  also a big fan of the baby backs they are usually excellent but they dont always have them  i saw some comments about the regular ribs not being fall of the bone and ive had the same experience but typically if you want fall off the bone then you should be going with baby backs  id also recommend the brisket over the pulled pork hands down  corn muffins are good also  cant beat the roadside ambience of a bbq truck and this one hits it home","4009":"as a philadelphia local and native some friends thought this would be a fun excursion on a sunday afternoon they were right spending over 25 hours walking through chinatown asiatown and eating our way through was an excellent time the tour is free and eating at each of the 6 stops barely broke the 10 mark   jennifer was an excellent guide providing great insight into the history of philadelphia chinatown and its surroundings as well as great advice on what to order at each of the locations   id recommend this tour for locals looking for a fun and adventurous weekend or for any out of towners looking for something off the beaten path","4012":"probably the best burger joint in santa barbara area","4014":"this little place will not disappoint hubs had a ceasar salad with blackened chicken i had firehouse grilled cheese just yum on grilled sourdough bread fried mac n cheese bites are to die for reasonable prices good service and get thisthey deliver menu includes many varieties of grilled cheese quesadillas mac n cheese bowls nice kids menu too definitely going back","4015":"surprised i havent posted a review for twisted iron before  ive tried them a number of times since they arrived on the road from their waffle fries to their chicken and waffles  twisted iron has always whipped out some tasty food truck eats that are both unique and delicious i was really happy to see them out and about after tampa luv chickens unfortunate ending  although im not originally from tampa i would say my taste for fried chicken and waffles is probably the most southern thing about me and twisted iron delivers the owners are young and friendly  clearly passionate about their food prices average 610 which is standard for food truck food  the actual food truck itself is modern with a clean wrap and mostly visible interior im not much of a dessert guy  but i do like waffle dessert choices that are offered by twisted iron  shoutout to anna m for sharing some of her pulled pork waffle fries with me today at the food court  they were delicious and hit the spot i hope to see twisted iron around soon with some new creations","4017":"a great place for cheap ripe produce because its ripe its better to buy as you need rather than in advance for a week love this place","4018":"so delicious top notch food service and its super cute inside the owner brad is really friendly helpful with the menu and just overall welcoming and makes you feel like a longtime friend","4020":"all their locations are pretty good authentic food with lots of choices and great portions love their babaganoush chicken shawarma hummus tabouli like the south tampa location has an outdoor patio area  a room for bigger parties","4026":"excellent inexpensive takeout banhmi from a very unassuming deli counter at the back of this midcity corner store definitely have them add homemade pat for 5075 havent tried their other dishes but definitely will next time","4027":"nutella

shopping experience","4031":"i am always searching for the perfect cheesesteak after having lived on the east coast home of awesome cheesesteaks and steak bombs  i think i have finally found a place in tucson for great cheesesteaks and that is here","4033":"jamba jamba ive always loved jamba juice in fact when i moved to the midwest i was deeply saddened by the fact that there wasnt any around where i lived i would have seriously driven half an hour or more to go to one if there was one when i first moved here  enough about my gripes so there is one thats only about 9 minutes from where i live and its connected to a schnucks you could do some grocery shopping and finish it up with a refreshing healthy smoothie i personally love their protein berry workout smoothie  a blend of soy milk strawberries bananas and a choice of either soy or whey protein boost its pretty much a meal replacement especially if you dont have time to stop and have a hearty breakfast if you would like a healthier breakfast though they have some deliciouslooking energy bowls i might try one on my days off  i have also had their chocolate mood smoothie and it was pretty good but that was a long time ago i used to drive an hour to go to the other side of the island to the jamba juice location honestly a 9minute drive is nothing i am a happy person and i will definitely be back maybe more often than i would like to","4035":"i love shopping for wine beer and liquor here huge selection i host a wine night with friends and we can always find the random wines we need here staff is always knowledgeable and carries the cases to my car top notch service","4040":"this place is great the bartenders are wonderful and the oyster bar delivers great company the atmosphere is easy and not pretentious as other restaurants of this caliber can be thanks for a great dinner drinks and company","4042":"i love la colombe  not all branches have the same interior the rittenhouse branch is really cozy  with beautiful tables that match the cups and saucers used   the iced almond mocha was good not too chocolatey but not too bitter either it was just right   and the croissant was really good too ive never tasted bad almond croissant but i guess i could say this is one of the best   definitely going to their fishtown branch to get a hold of that draft latte","4043":"my friends and i always love coming here they have an array of flavors and they are all unique my favorites are the lavender earl grey and champagne sorbet the prices are also very fair  however this place is cash only so just keep that in mind i definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting some ice cream or just craving sweets","4044":"yummy yummy yummy this place is by far one of the best sushi restaurants ive ever been to and i have been eating sushi since i was a little girl each meal was flavorful and delicious from the miso soup to the two rolls my sister and i shared great service danelo great food and fast cooking so thankful we decided to try this place out will be back","4047":"the freezer packs are not only a great deal  they are always super fresh and ready to pop in the ice chest once you get home the meats taste great and are priced usually better than a supermarket kevin talks very fast  but he definitely knows what he is talking about they have a decent deli selection too with boars head meats and cheeses i dont personally care for their homemade sausages chicken or pork because they are a little too lean for my preference the bacon is the best youll find around and is cured without sugar","4050":"yes pricey but convenient and its a small family owned store not a huge selection but past friendly clean cute and convenient","4052":"great place  i have allergies so i love a place that cooks to order and we willingly makes adjustments","4053":"my god why isnt there a line running outside the door to get into this place  the food and sides are soooo good  i love catfish and harolds fried catfish is without a doubt right up there with the best catfish ive ever ate anywhere in the us including the deep south  the mac and cheese is simply delicious  silky smooth with oven browned cheese goodness mixed in just like a good mac and cheese should be  i only wish i could have got some collared greens as a side but they were out of them and the green beans were seasoned great so i wasnt completely left out in the cold  im certainly going to work my way through the rest of the side dishes in upcoming visits  good honest scratch cooking done right","4054":"wow excellent service and the best calamari i have ever had the beer was good and atmosphere friendly nothing negative about this place at all","4055":"socal burger  so darn good  so good that ive eaten at bareburger on at least 5 occasions but always order the same darn thing avocado pickled onions and i always add a little jalapeo for some extra heat   i also love that they deliver  as such bareburger has been my default lunch option for rainy days when im in no mood to leave the office","4056":"the best italian market outside of nyc  we are so lucky to have this store in st petersburg everything they have is fantastic the bakery deli pasta butcher etc the best","4057":"i have celiacs disease and was diagnosed at 19 years old i have been eating gluten free for 13 years and there are times when i sadly miss the delicious sweet treats you get at a bakery since becoming gluten free i have been in search of sweets that taste like the real thing if not better than the real thing  the happy mixer has nailed it i have been given their cupcakes as gifts and i cant even share them with others because they are that good i am also addicted to their brownies and oatmeal raisin cookies which i get at jules thin crust in doylestown and i am in love   the cost of their high quality goods is more affordable than anything i have found in a grocery store or another bakery that is not strictly gluten free  this place offers fresh and beautiful items and you can tell that they really care about the food they are providing and love what they do   i appreciate this place and hope that everyone even those without a gluten allergy give this place a chance because this is better than the real thing  keep up the amazing work","4058":"the manager zack has really cleaned up this place the service is much better like it was shortly after it opened check it out","4060":"great burger spot my first order was their sunny side up burger with an egg and applewood bacon i was hooked from that point i have tried most of their menu of burgers and made a few of my own its is a lot of fun to go their after a night of partying and challenge your friends to an oldfashion game of burger builder","4063":"oh yes go immediately to this place buy a filet of snapper and experience what it is like to eat truly fresh fish   i cannot explain to you what it is like to eat a truly fresh piece of fish it does not smell fishy it does not taste fishy it is not rubbery it is not dry   it just tastes like deliciously sweet flakes of heaven  red snapper go get some while its in season","4064":"love this new italian market restaurant the waiters were as nice and helpful as can be the food was phenomenal  do not miss the short rib pasta we had probably 6 or 7 dishes plus dessert and the only thing that wasnt basically perfect was the duck with cauliflower rice  the cauliflower rice was quite salty but other than that overall flavor of it was also great i would order everything we got again including the delicious desserts and cant wait to try the rest of the menu","4069":"if you like pancakes and efficient no frill service this place is for you if the line is reasonable you can get in and out and well fed within 30mins blueberry pancakes are the best","4070":"visited new orleans for the end of mardi gras and stumbled upon this little cafe for

are other wendys locations closer to me where i live but i wont eat at them however this one is close to where i work and i will stop in if i feel like a great lunch at a good price the place always gets a large lunch crowd but the waits are minimal and the service is fast   very clean eatery  update  ive been eating lunch at this location for 11 years and have never had a truly bad meal i

meal i went with the livery margarita 9 made with maestro dobel diamante lazaroi triplo fresh lime juice and agave add some salt to the rim and this was pretty tasty  i also went with the roaster vegetables with chimichuri a nice and somewhat healthy way to dine   valet parking is a must around here unless you happen to be lucky enough to score a parking spot out front or on mass ave if

other baked goods but i cant get past that freshly made perfectly crunchy shell with the amazing nottosweet creamy chocolatey chip filling its worth the hassle of trying to find parking and walking

my trusty yelp app and searched for local gems i saw lots of great reviews for poke bowl and it was close by so i made my way over i had never had poke before and was very excited to try this new trend the selections for protein are mostly raw so if youre not into that theres not much here for you you create your bowl by picking either greens or rice and adding protein 3 or 5 scoops vegetables toppings and sauce they complete the bowl by adding a pretty edible flower this is such a nice touch my bowl was excellent i had rice with octopus shrimp and salmon topped with mango pineapple and a sweet sauce the combination was a stellar one so many great flavors came together for an awesome experience the cost for my small poke bowl and a drink came to about 13 it was a little expensive for a casual lunch but worth the experience delicious","4118":"what a little neighbourhood gem amazing espresso drinks friendly staff and if you follow their tweets you can salivate over your iphone as you

stumbled upon this shelfish shack last year when i was in town for july 4th weekend and immediately i was hooked this place is small and located at the end of the pier parking can be a problem sometimes but i guess you can valet it up front or wait it out when you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them i always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder absolutely the best ive had thus far they also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits overall you can try alot of different fresh shellfish without paying as much as you

the macrons are always to die for each melting in your mouth even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days the darkness croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume   the harry potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where i purchased a few specialties the tonks chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center the pumpkin pasties went great with

myself what in the world is a fried cheese curd well today i finally got the chance to find out they are delicious they remind you of fried mozzarella but way better pretty expensive but well worth it if you are trying them for the first time  i also got the smokey ketchup dipping sauce which paired great with the cheese curds i would not recommend eating these often because it is a lot of fried cheese but if you must have some fried cheesy goodness this is the way to go  i will never look at mozzarella sticks the same again","4187":"wonderful place pumpkin pie cheesecake ice cream was great  700 for 3 people instead of 7 per person","4188":"amidst a long exciting day of shopping my friend and i worked up quite an appetite so at her suggestion we headed over to 500 degrees  she had been there a number of times before and had great things to say about their food and since im always up for trying new places more recently independent burger joints i happily obliged  i settled on a cheeseburger combo with sweet potato fries and was on the fence about getting a milkshake but opted for a lemonade instead which hit the spot just as well  the burger was incredible as were the fries not too greasy very flavorful and cooked just right  i will stop in again and next time i will get a milkshake","4190":"cant never go wrong best in stl i love the chocolate chip concrete so many

was walking down south grand after dinner one day and i was intrigued by the coffeeshopesque feel of the interior its a really homey place inside with wooden chairs and tables and theres a great patio in the back with a fountain and christmas lights strung about   they have a great variety of flavors and the sizes are very much reasonably priced the small is two flavors and its pretty huge for less than 4 theres a lot of ice cream shops nowadays that charge 5 for a single scoop and its absurd gelateria del leone is not one of those places   they have the normal gelato flavors like lemon raspberry chocolate coffee salted carmel but my favorite is the london fog  an earl grey tea flavor another popular one is the maya spicy chocolate one or something like that try them pick your favorites and you can even order a coffee or drink with it as well  definitely a great spot to hit if youre in the area would recommend","4200":"the mayor of ville platte la recommended this place as a spot where i can find an ideal pecan praline or as they say it in the south pekhan prahleen  stepping inside you learn they are award winning and arent hurting for business    folks are happy to advise you on packing storing and traveling with these tasty morsels  remember  dont refrigerate them  yes you can probably find ones made with even more love in less urban areas  it was just easier to access these as we were driving thru the city  they also carry so many flavors  i will say it was a tight space for wheelchairs so navigate cautiously","4203":"first time buyer and immediately impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service from david i bought 3 bottles of wine to be shipped to a friend and provided the wrong address after the shipment was delivered david

amazing","4228":"costco is a great place to come when you do not have any problems in your life so you need to create one your problem will be that you bought too much cereal at once or maybe big muffins also you might accidentally buy a 32pack of individual hummus cups and then you will eat all of the hummus in 3 days because it is there and you cannot be expected to practice selfcontrol with such a pleasant and flavorful chickpea dip this costco is great because it is full of white people who pretend to be in a hurry they pretend to be in a hurry because that is what everybody else is doing there are also free samples here they are mostly handed out by very large women who have to sit on stools that are just regularsized they have sadness inside of their eyes i think this makes life flash before my eyes real quick because i wonder why they have to do that job i wonder if i will ever have to do that i start to feel sad i wonder how many of the samples they get to eat a lot i hope this costco gives me very bad social anxiety mostly because it is so crowded and everybody is pushing around those giant carts i am afraid of being in the way of one and getting accidentally smashed to death that would not be an ideal way to go this costco has great bathrooms there are lots of stalls so you can still use the bathroom even if someone is in there doing a lot of poop all at once sometimes my mom buys a big churro on the way out of costco she eats it in the car on the way home and asks me if i want some even though she is just eating it like a big corn dog i say no thank you we dont have any more conversations after that","4229":"great little spot with fresh ice cream pizzas sandwiches and beer the ice cream was amazing and incredibly fresh locally owned so nice to support the community right off the pinellas trail with a nice sized patio so this its really convenient lunch stop on a long ride","4232":"the pastries were absolutely delicious and worth every penny  the coffee was decent coffee although overpriced  i do like the clean minimalist design but it was almost too minimalist  the bar style seating at the window is nice  you get some great natural lighting and can watch the passers on central ave  the staff was very friendly  plenty of space in the coffee shop and doesnt feel like an overcrowded starbucks  i would highly recommend this coffee shop  the only reason im not giving it 5 stars is because i thought the price on the coffee was a bit high  important edit  bandit coffee got in touch with me regarding my review  they were appreciative of my response and informed me as to why they charge slightly more for their coffee their vendors are independent companies they pay their employees fairly and a lot of their products that make the coffee and drinks come from local companies or are hand made  knowing all of this makes it well worth the extra 50 cents to a buck for a cup of coffee im not just supporting bandit im supporting other local companies too    5 stars for bandit","4233":"incredibly delicious  we tried it at diablo burger  sugar skull sweet stout abv 52 this craft beer brings all the boys to the yard

in montecito this is definitely not the place for a starving student but certainly is if you want to feel like a million bucks the food was amazing some of the best risotto i have had in a long long while youd think you were paying 3050 per plate at this plate but really the prices are much lower than that the staff was very attentive and fancy which was nice for lunch it was pretty quiet in there despite the large family at the table nearby i guess the place would have to be packed and the tons of people out say a weekend night for it to be loud but for lunch it was great my step mom had their burger carbless and says its the best burger shes ever had this is definitely a fancy restaurant pricey for the rest of us lowermiddle class folk but you get that upper upper class feel for upper middle class price so in terms of value vs quality they receive 5 stars for me cordial attentive customer service very polite responsive and quick service try the risotto with mozzarella and chicken its amazing the fetuchinne con mare e monti was also delish as well so if you want to blow some money on absolutely yummo food and feel its more than worth it come here best part  you can go casual too","4282":"the best chicken sandwich ever i am addicted to the big mary combo i get tatters and macaroni salad this location has the best chicken poppers and the best dipping sauce is the honey mustard the gravy is drink worthy lol seriously lol","4284":"the philly pretzel factory makes the best philly pretzels around the company has various locations so wherever you are in the tristate area you wont be too far from one of their stores this location is right off of 70 in a small strip mall  there is parking in front of the store and to the side the staff here is very friendly and willing to help in addition to selling pretzels ppf offers a few other treats one of my favorite being the pretzel dogs   philly pretzels are perfect for parties and ppf makes it easy with two tray size options for their nuggets sticks or mini pretzels they ask for a days notice on party orders they can also make custom pretzel designs letters run 1 each","4285":"what is not to love about sherbrooke liquor store seriously the best selection of beer in town as well as a pretty awesome selection of spirits as well  the liquor store location is anything but ideal  the surrounding shops are a bit suspect and the area isnt one of the better ones in the city  this is where my complaining is going to stop  once you walk into the doors the staff are usually very good about greeting you  the sliding door to the beer cooler is immediately on the right  bring your warm coat its cold in the cooler    the cooler is chock a block full of beer some wine and sake  the space between the shelving is very narrow and usually there isnt enough room to even get past someone else  the shelves are floor to over 6 ft and full of various beers  they have done a pretty good job of grouping the different beers ie local seasonal pilsners fruitflavour etc  there are a few tags on the various beers in each section that highlight staff picks and hidden gems  which is always welcome as you get to try something that someone else thinks is a winner    the remainder of the liquor store the heated part isnt as crammed as the beer cooler but still offers up a fairly big selection of different spirits and wines    overall sherbrooke is going for uniqueness and not quantity  the beer selection is by far the best in the city  they also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits  some of the spirits can be had for less if you are going for the more common ones the ones that can be found elsewhere  ive had several conversations with different staff and they are all very helpful and will help guide you if you need assistance   this is my goto for beer","4289":"dont let the big crowd scare you awaythese people know what they are doing the line moves fast check out the menu on the side of the building so you know what you want when you order the custard concretes were delicious we had to reeses and one oreo the prices are fair for what you getjust eat it fast bc it melts quickly","4290":"bakery house makes my favorite cakes ever my mom still surprises me with one every year for my birthday always vanilla with vanilla buttercream frosting theyre fantastic better than any other cakes ive ever had their designs tend to be pretty basic nothing intricate or entirely special my mom always orders the cakes so i cant speak to their customer service ive tried a few other things over the years lemon bars cupcakes blondies and everything is always amazing their cakes freeze exceptionally well its crazy try their cakes you wont be sorry","4291":"one of the best seafood places not in new orleans i used to get the blackened chicken salad but this time i tried the swordfishamazing the service was great diana was quick and professional will be back again as always","4292":"the food  service is magnificent they make everything fresh  made to order you want it fast try mcdonalds food was out in less than 10 delicious burger  hot dog all negative reviews must be people who are mad at life","4299":"i love love iron hill in voorhees food is always great and such a great selection of beers on tap","4301":"a nashville landmark and obligatory stop on the toursit circuit they say you will see celebrities here i once saw kevin costner  the line is outrageously long but it actually moves pretty fast and it is actually worth it  best pancakes ive ever had  go with a group so you can each order a different pancake conconction they are all so intriguing and it is impossible to decide  i like waking up before 7 on a sunday to beat the crowd and going there with the paper  service is very friendly in an authentic warm southern way","4304":"great brewery this was the 201st brewery my husband and i have been to and it ranks right up there great beer great vibe friendly and knowledgeable staff and perhaps most telling of all there was a diverse crowd of beer drinkers  not only young or older or men or women looking forward to returning in the summer chilling outside and making new friends","4305":"this is not the place for vanilla ice cream with fudge sauce go to your grocerys frozen food section for that yeah the flavours sound odd to the average ice cream consumer but omg you will go in and can proclaim you will die happy after leaving try the raspberry white chocolate flan and fried banana well anything is good on the menu i would know about 40 of us showed both times i went and the place was already packed service was slow but still friendly and definitely well worth the wait","4309":"love this place the atmosphere is very laid back and the lavender vanilla latte was delicious perfect place to study or relax with a book","4313":"delicious their house milk tea is to die for they have two types of milk tea one is the original i think thats the name and the second is the house milk tea the house milk tea has a mellower flavor and not too sweet the original one is a bit spicier and much sweeter if you dont have a sweet tooth go for the house tea also i have gotten great service both times i have been here dont be afraid to ask them to adjust the sweetness   the only issue i have with this place is that they dont have a location near me so i have to drive about 20 minutes to get there  but that might be a good thing for my wallet since i would probably be here every day multiple times a day if it was near my house","4314":"checked this place out as soon as i landed in nashville there was a bit of a line going out of the door but it went by fairly quickly id say 1520 minutes once we were seated the service was pretty quick and friendly i ordered hot chocolate with marshmallows to drink and it was so delicious best hot chocolate ive had in awhile i also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of potatoes and was very pleased great food and service","4318":"this is exactly type of saintpetersburg russia coffee places i miss so much here chill music nice choice no salads only coffee and tea and small amount of bakery nice stuff fast service delicious food stylish menu and look thank you","4326":"five words peanut butter chocolate milk stout dear gawd i love this stuff keep in mind i was skeptical i usually stick with single speed which is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum but when literally every other person you are with is drinking this reeses cup beer you eventually take a sip and discover that it is delicious and you kick single speed to the curb and end up roaming around randalls like a crazy person until the nice girl stocking beer notices you and carries over a bottle asking is this what youre looking for and you want to hug her but i digress  if you cant track down the peanut butter their regular chocolate milk stout runs a close second in my book and this is coming from someone who is not a big fan of dark beers maybe my taste buds are changing with old age who knows i have my fingers crossed that they wont take it away as the weather warms up  the tasting room is probably one of my current favorite spaces its all concrete and metal a distressed wood and an awesome wall of custom wallpaper its a stencil its gets crazy crowded in here on weekends but the bartenders are efficient and it never takes long to get a refill they also have limited seating outside on the sidewalk which is awesome on warm days and they generally have an amazing soundtrack going   if drinking round after round of beer gives you the drunk munchies no just me you can grab a snack from fifth wheel which is basically a tiny baileys kitchen that offers up nachos pretzels and other pub fare to go along with your beer order and pay at the window and they come find you when youre food is ready","4327":"quick service good coffee   they actually have coffeelates on tap like in a keg on nitro and let me try a sample  delicious  atmosphere is great  all in all a very cool coffee place","4328":"amazing food super flavorful with every bite definitely coming back here highly recommend the platter and butter naan","4333":"good price and very tasty i called ahead to order for pickup the restaurant is just a few minutes down the road from me so thats another bonus i saw all the good reviews and rating so i had to give it a try i got there right before a rush and was waiting for my food and talking to memo who works there hes very friendly i was glad i got there when i did because four more customers came in memo was very nice and helped them with the menu and gave suggestions i got home and chowed down on two steak tacos and a buffalo chicken taco totally delicious try this place youll love it","4336":"highly recommend this costco store service i bought the tires online and took in my car for them to be installed and they didnt fit the manager got a more expensive tire set comped for free and personally went out to get them from another warehouse just so i could have my car back within the same day","4337":"amazing food ridiculously high quality ingredients definitely will come back whenever i get a chance","4338":"excellent brews nice area provided to enjoy the product","4339":"absolutely adore this place we were stopped yesterday by a man giving out samples and went right inside after sampling their amazing product we ended up purchasing white cheddar chipotle oreo explosion and peanut butter blast popcorn the staff was really pleasant and recommended great flavors we will definitely be returning during our next day trip to new hope","4340":"zeppoli is the best restaurant around  i came here for dinner friday night as i have many times in the past   let me start off by saying that the food at zeppoli has never been anything but outstanding all of the dishes are wonderful but i have to tell you that the antipasto is a must there are usually about 10 different elements on the board including vegetables meats cheeses and salads like tuna and white bean some of my personal favorites are the butternut squash agrodolce and the stuffed peppers it is a really fun and interactive way to start off the meal and doesnt leave you feeling too full  the pasta is what makes this place a true gem all of the pastas are homemade and they usually have 1 or 2 specials every night all of the pasta creations are worth trying but the ricotta gnocchi will change your life before zeppoli i had never had a ricotta base gnocchi and now i cant seem to enjoy regular potato gnocchi anymore they are like eating little clouds the brown butter sauce and crispy sage are the perfect accompaniment if the squid ink pasta is ever on special when you go be sure to get it  the space itself is tiny but very romantic and intimate with just enough room around each table for the servers to pass through sometimes i feel like im sitting on top of other diners which may be an issue for some but its never bothered me  that brings me to the service sadly my favorite waiter tom no longer works here he was unbelievably knowledgeable and great at his job i have not been back here for dinner since he left so i was really anxious to see if the other servers had stepped it up fortunately they did and we experienced great service the whole night   i cannot wait to come back again soon now that i live in the area its going to be to be hard not to spend all of my money here ","4341":"incredible food and a small 7 platter is two meals worth for me  greens beans and rice jerk chicken or fried","4343":"cant go wrong with saganaky and the gyro delicious pita bread best greek salad ive ever had with potato salad in the middle i would come back just for the salad save room for the bakery that is connected many greek desserts that dont disappoint","4348":"i love this place the environment is very urban and homey and since you can see whats cooking literally in front of you you know youre getting the freshest of coffee and they roast their beans in house so in short its a great place with great coffee only downfall is that coffee is pricey but thats the price you pay for the whole shebang i guess","4351":"we were a few minutes late but they still added us on to the tour and caught is up to the group  we had an awesome guide  very friendly and personable  great beer sampling at the end  you get two free samples  they also have a gift shop  and they sell wing sauce  i didnt try it but it looked amazing  would highly recommend","4353":"i really enjoy their breakfast sandwiches  reasonable prices selma is always delightful friendly staff great local bagel shop lots of cream cheese varieties and fresh baked donuts","4358":"food was great and we had a large party so they put us up in sportys pub the crab cakes and crab balls were good really good time and would recommend to anyone just walking around","4359":"yum yum yummmmm on a recent trip we stopped off at santa barbara shellfish company for lunch we ordered the rock crab chowder in a bread bowl and the onion rings everything was so good   of course my favorite was the rock crab there was so much crab meat and it was buttery and sweet it melted in my mouth and the onion rings were battered to perfection the chowder  bread bowl was warm and delicious   cant wait for another trip to sb to have lunch again  although i think i traumatized my daughter when she saw how the crabs were killed lol","4362":"tanya and matt took over from i think it was a tcby and have really created a local following for this nice little shop i have to admit that ice cream is my down fall and they have enough flavors to keep an ice cream snob like myself happy and if you are looking for something a little healthier then you can go low cal yogurt they have just about every type of topping that you can think of they have had live music on the weekends and they even have a little play area for the kids plus some nice chairs to sit outside if the weather permits oh and if you are hiding your fetish for ice cream they have a drive through so you can wear dark glasses and no one will know its you not that i have do that overall its a great experience","4363":"this place is the best unbelievable foodspectacular service poboys are better than a lot of the ones ive had in new orleans everything here is authentic and heartfelt one of the great dining experiences that delco has to offer","4364":"this is a great mexican restaurant  delicious authentic food and very good service  i will certainly return next time i go to st louis","4365":"i love this place from the wonderful wine selection to the friendly staff i always leave with a smile and a newly discovered bottle of wine prices are fantastic and you can find some fabulous wines for under 10 they also have a nice craft beer selection with lots of local favorites this is my favorite wine shop and i highly recommend it   best wine shop in south tampa","4369":"the cinnamon roll is to die for seriously must get also loved the breakfast buns stuffed with sausage and bacon","4371":"had my first ted drewes concrete this week   turtlemmmmmm really rich but good  went back because i heard they sold dry ice and needed some for the trip home  nice folks and highly recommend you stop by on your trip to st louis","4372":"super friendly awesome gyros with fresh pita  i lived several years in greece and although theres no substitute for the real thing this is close  in addition the place is spot on clean   well be back often","4375":"gelato is always a favorite on a hot tucson day and frost is the place to get it  when you walk inside their counter is a showcase of delightful flavors and you can have as many tastes as you want before deciding what to purchase  they also serve shakes root beer floats and other confections none of which i have tried  the only downside to this location is that there are only two or three small tables inside  being that this is a popular spot in the summer the tables fill up quickly and you are relagated to sitting outside at tables that are shaded but still in the heat even so it is worth a trip when you are in the mood for a yummy treat  this is a family owned business that is just starting to offer franchises and expand into other locations","4377":"this is a great place for breakfast when you are visiting montecito  the greek omelet is amazing the bloody mary is perfect and the service is attentive and fast  it is an elegant but casual place with cloth napkins on the tables and nice decorations   i would recommend getting reservations for larger groups","4379":"great coffee and atmosphere lots of seating options depending on your needs they have a small selection of sweets and they are good small parking lot on the side but plenty of street parking as well","4380":"this is my idea of heaven  i dream of a yelp event in which i get to sample everything and it is one of the best days of my life  dont get me wrong they do give samples but i would drive them up a wall let me try the snow now the milk tea now the green tea ice cream now one of each flavor  please dont hang me  im not a fan of the tapioca balls  rather i am an lychee jelly person  i tried the aloe which was similar to chucks of jello but it had nothing on my lychee jelly  my husband loves the popping boba  i usually get the taro or the cantaloupe slush  just typing them made me want to hop in my car for a brain freeze  ive also been down the kiwi road while good it was on borderline artificial tasting  i also sampled the egg custard and i think i can get behind that  now while i am sans the vitamix and the super cool machine that seals your beverage with adorable kawaii characters i had the brilliant idea at lee lees to pick up some boba powder  mistake  leave the boba to the experts    if you ever want to loose at a game of jenga while enjoying some bings  im there  also pm me with your favorite combos  i say lets have uye at bings to see who can concoct the most tasty beverage and enjoy a boba smorgasbord","4381":"great little coffee shop with surprisingly ample seating this gets 5stars for the fact that they have the best coffee at the cheapest place in the area the specialty drinks are large and delicious as well","4383":"loved the salmon poke bowl that i get here  weve been two times so far and really love the freshness of the fish not to mention nicesized cuts and the sushi rice  and the easy drivethru makes this our current goto spot  excited to go eat there next week","4387":"noting in central jersey can compare to the bagels coming out of rolings real ny style that is hard to find even in ny these days  luck me that my inlaws live a few blocks away  come early and get them hot  no two look the same","4388":"great atmosphere  service and food  love the menu simple yet options are full of lots of flavor prices are great and food came out fresh and yummy very refreshing option from the local compition from what i saw at least","4389":"hello schlafly was in stl for the day and wanted to take my newlyturned21yearoldsister to a brewery being the day after christmas other breweries in the area were closed i wont drop any names so looking for a quick alternative i stumbled upon schlafly i didnt know much about the brewery itself i knew my stl classmates from college always ordered schlafly at the bars and i found out quickly why so its comparable to boulevard reppin kc though smaller in size and production we stopped in for a tour tours start at the top of the hour and it was the quickest brewery tour ever no complaints here considering that meant we got to the tasting quicker the tour was super fast as i mentioned and we literally just walked back and forth in the back production area while our tour guide who was very knowledgable witty and interesting gave us a quick rundown of their plant and how beer is made the coolest part as always was the tasting at the end of the tour we tried their oktoberfest summer lager export ipa and lastly by request of another tour member their coffee stout the coffee stout was delish and my sisters favorite out of the ones we tried the tasting was super chill and casual very intimate with our small tour group all of which i enjoyed afterwards my sis and i bought some souvenirs wish they had a better packaging system for their souvenir glasses we just had them put into a 6pack container and were sent off souvenirs were decently priced i saw they had a restaurant in the building but didnt get a chance to check it out this time around im happy we stumbled upon this little gem loved it","4391":"awesome service  incredible food and beer  like others have said we walked in the front door and the hostess was several booths beyond    friendly and quick service if your want a unique take on a traditional burger give this place a shot  a perfectly cooked burger and all the fixings inside a thinner pizza crust delicious best food yet","4393":"best pizza i have had in a long time the lunch special was a really good value 10 for a small pizza choice of salad and a soda the crust was great the sauce was really flavorful i love that you can see the pizza oven when you walk in the door i will remember this place the next time im in town for lunch","4395":"awesome bubble tea im from boston and never thought id ever be able to find quality bubble tea in the midwest   their yogurt is great too","4396":"i absolutely love this place the food is superb the wine is great the atmosphere is cozy but still feels trendy ive been here several times now and each time we closed the place down its just a great place to sit enjoy your meal and have a long conversation with your friends one of my favorite dishes is the skirt steak 17 its a tasty perfectly seasoned cut of meat just the right amount of salt and fat and lime on it i tried the chicken empanada and the mushroom one and by far liked the chicken one better ive also enjoyed the paella with shrimp which i had during devour indy my only complaint was that the serving was a little small for me and i was still hungry afterwards but the delicious chocolate flan and the churros that followed that meal remedied that problem i would recommend this place to anyone whether its for a business meeting or an evening out with friends","4402":"went here 2nd night they were open and it was great  the beers were fabulous and the staff was great  if they had food id have stayed longer","4406":"i love this place  great fresh pasta made onsite and a very complete wine offering  i will continue to support this place  we always bring friends here when in town from other places around the country all are impressed","4407":"we live in the neighborhood so it is good for us that the food is very good prices are better than we would expect for the quality our japanese friend wants to go whenever he is in town","4408":"i seriously ate pralines all over the new orleans area airport included and the original pralines here were the best i have ever had theyre light sweet and creamy with the perfect amount of crunch i definitely made my way into this shop every time we passed i also had a peanut butter covered oreoyes you read that correctly yumm not sure it was an actual oreo but id definitely eat it again oh the peanut butter pralines tasted like pb fudge sample everything buy many there were so many other delicious treats to choose from it was hard to pick just dont forget to take something home","4409":"whats not to love about a boba tea place that offers bobas multiple ways slush ice milk and tea i had a yummy handmade mango slush boba tea with purple tapioca balls and my wife had leechee with bobas theres no other place to get cool flavors like this plus you can have flavored jellies instead of bobas  we had finished dinner at ikkyu and walked down the strip mall to bings and found the proprietor who had been to china japan hong kong and california  all boba tea capitals   at last we northsiders have
