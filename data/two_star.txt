meh is all i can say for tds the restaurant itself is just cold not literally but figuratively there was no decor no menu boards stainless steel prep tables as dining tables no soda machines staff everywhere with no identification shirts nametags etc the food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa we ordered a salsa trio which included 3 samples of the various salsas in 2oz glass prep bowls and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos mind you we ordered one of ever taco three burritos and guacamole he was told hed have to buy the trio again really we spent over 40 on food drinks and apps too even though the food was decent i wouldnt return as the atmosphere is just blah and you cant get extra salsa for your damn tacosreally below average food  akin to waffle house  i wanted this to be good based on the reviews but not so  the pancakes tasted like a frozen processed version homemade maple syrup was waterysugary with fake flavoring  trees make authentic syrup not people  the hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless the bacon overcooked hard and chewy  obviously had been sitting awhile overall very uninspired food  unfortunately this is one of those places that is living on an outdated must go reputation  there are much better offerings in nashvillehad a falafel wrap here a few years ago not bad so tried it again today no flavor except extreme saltiness the falafels  pita  no flavor i was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together nope it had no flavor either it wasnt like the sauce youd imagine but more like a thin tasteless glue only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber  tomato too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesnt even deserve to be called tzatziki  ordered caramel frappe at drive thru big mistake took 30 min and there were only 2 cars in front of meafter going there several times going to fresh i am sad to report my last visit was not up to par  i went with a group of people and the service  product was not how it used to be and the price was outrageous to say the least  i entered and was not greet by the staff  and i do understand that the group i was meeting with was taking up most the inside of fresh but a little acknowledgement would have went a long way  also i ordered the vienna latte with an extra shot  it not only was one of the worst espresso based drinks i have ever had but it was expensive 7 for a coffee  after realizing the price for the drink i was put off by ordering any products  i really love fresh and obviously from prior posts i do praise their products but this time it was one of the worst experiences i have hadthis is the mcdonalds closest to my home but i will forever drive any distance to find another bc its a terrible restaurant even though its not politically correct to say i love mcdonalds every now and again and during lent we go to mcdonalds and this one is really bad bad food always cold or wrong items  bad service and no offense to anyone but i cannot even communicate with most employees bc they dont speak any english  i do not know much spanish either but when im trying to spend my money in fishers indiana at a business i at least expect to be able to communicate in some way  their service is the slowest from any mcdonalds in this area  my advice pass on this location unless you have allot of time and can speak spanish i didnt really like my sandwich i got here i got the jalapeo cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry i could tell it was old also i got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe usually theyre a lot better than this but today wasnt it the staff is very friendly thoughwaited 27 minutes for three teas no one else was in the store when we came in and ordered no tea is worth that long of a wait especially in chinatowni recently moved in a few blocks away from henrys and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house so on a beautifully humid august morning i walked over to check it   1 the atmosphere is pretty standard open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout no college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either lacked uniqueness   2 the name henry reminds me of thomas the tank engine was there a train named henry on there or not if so was he chill or not could add one star for chill train association   3 the coffee was not good i got an iced coffee stfu and it was super bitter the amount of ice in it wasnt obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk  im coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn henry  not a great first impressionno dark beer in february  nice looking place and nice folks  summer beer in february was a disappointmenti heard a number of good things about this place but i was very disappointed parking is terrible which isnt a huge deal but be prepared to spend a few minutes looking for a parking spot we ordered 5 tacos total and it took about 30 minutes to get them it seemed a little ridiculous for a few tacos plus they werent even hot slightly warm at best taste was ok but wasnt anything special at all buffalo chicken wasnt great the  bbq and korean were decent and the shrimp was mediocre overall i gave it a shot and it wasnt worth the wait and effort parking so i dont see us going backpulled pork sandwich was delicious  but the lucky bun asian fusion style  burger  was a disappointment for the sole purpose of them using a frozen beef patty   the bread was good  the toppings and sauces were great  but just killed the flavors with a processed frozen beef patty  if used a fresh ground meat  it would have been a great gourmet burger good menu solid ingredients but these folks are not sandwich artists  i had a turkey and brie wrap one day and the spinach florentine wrap the next  both wraps could have more fittingly been called crumples because thats how they were assembled  while watching the sandwich line i kept thinking thank god theyre not trying to fold burritos  everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago  also can we please hang a few signs like order here pickup here payhere to direct traffic instead of the east coast if you don already know then leave attitudetheres been three times that ive ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and had to turn all the way back and go inside and have theme remake itcame here with some friends during mardi gras even though it was a busy weekend and lots of people everywhere a lot of places arent over crowded the bartenders were just awful the service was lacking and the pizza sucked   pros they had portopotty 2 put back which made it easier for a bathroom break outdoor seating area near the parade route convenient   cons bartenders dont take drink orders properly they skip people ignore you at the bar when you walk up it wasnt that busy lots of standing around bartenders didnt know what microbrew meant or ipa beers no jokei love chickfila so much and was so excited to get one down the street from me no more sudden realizations that im in rivergate or cool springs and should take advantage of a chickfila i could go any time  but what the hell  apparently nashvillians dont know how to use a double lane drive through  and may i ask why the drive thru goes around the front of the restaurant instead of the back of the restaurant like every other damn fast food restaurant  though kudos for the free wifi that i can use on my phone while im waiting twenty minutes in line at the drive thru  so i avoid this place like the plague ill wait til next time im in rivergate or cool springs for some amazing waffle friesburger was ok but not at all worth the price i felt cramped sitting at the long table surrounded by people i did not know service was ok if they brought the prices way down it would be better as it is now its a really expensive mediocre burger there are much much better places in st louis both in terms of taste and valuesome of the fare on offer at that bbq place is wildly overpriced especially given the fact that real cutlery proper table service and glassware are all missing  while this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service im unlikely to return  it wont matter though for its busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed  their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking  in the end sherwood parkers seem to like the place and thats all that matters for the ownersgets two stars because the service was great and staff was very friendly food was not very good maybe we came on a bad day i ate there and ordered a togo item for my husband i asked the girl working the counter to pick the most popular thing out of the german section for him and it was literally just a pretzel and a piece of sausage in a boxive been having a terrible time in st louis finding a decent chinese place that is within delivery or easy take out range of our house this time i tried wei hong i told my partner it cant be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going i was wrong the take out service was fast for a sat night we were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready but the dining room was empty for a sat night that should have been a big clue the rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy the steamed dumplings could have been great the tasted homemade and the filling was good however they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling everything else went downhill from there  the beef and broccoli was inedible the beef had an awful weird texture like it was boiled and was gelatinous  the sauce on it had off flavors we literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out  the meat in both the general taos chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures it was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well the flavors in the sauces would have been fine but they were gloopy  the fried rice was fair but nothing memorable we wont be going backmehi wasnt impressed with this spot looking past the array of hand written signs and lack of available bagels the food was ok i got the pastrami egg and cheese there was hardly any pastrami and the cheese wasnt melted my wife also had the pleasure of adding spoiled creamer to her coffee i think well just stick with einsteins or st pete bagelthe food is excellent the customer service and quantity over time has continued to go down ive been going to this place every couple weeks for two years the portions over time have continued to gradually get smaller and smaller i commented on this because my take out dish is now to the point where it is less then half full when i order when it used to go to the top when i commented on this i was told i was wrong  i proceeded to explain my case i was told if i didnt want to take the food i didnt have to pay for it i said ok and was the berated for not taking the food i ordered   long story short these people have lost my business i am not going backgross just gross i ordered the white meat fried chicken with mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes as my sides chicken was slimy and salty sides were both cold and practically flavorless not to mention service was strange server busted out laughing while i was giving my order it made me uncomfortable as if he was laughing at us i didnt understand will not be backask yourself a question are you going for food or a blizzard if it is anything other than a blizzard find a different dq sadly it seems to be ran by young adults not even out of high school so dont expect the beat they have to offerthe food is very good but the ability to turnover the tables is a huge problem on busy days waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food i just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast they do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion there were many upset people there due to the time to wait while we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when i arrived which we waited an hour to be seated the workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules i will not be coming back due to this experienceplace has really slipped as far as food quality pork steak was dry and tough and i wish theyd have let me pick which sauce from the squeeze bottles on the table the bbq nachos wed shared here before many times was soggy and tasteless we were there early evening saturday and they werent busy at all  i guess words gotten around   still good service like before  probably not returningwe  heard that fresh market was open and since we just got back from vaca we thought we would try it  first of all accolades to the staff they could not have been more helpful  especially thomas in the meat section  for these two things i would give them a five  however it does downhill from this point on  ordered one pound of swiss cheese after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes and no one else was on line the unfriendly clerk waited on us the imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese rather than many slices  i bought ricotta cheese for easter and went to open it and it was bad although it was dated 328  the tomatoes on the vine that i bought on friday were bad by sunday  i have found their prices very high selection poor and at this point it is just not worth it i also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par  very dry and tasteless overall a very disappointing shopping trip  there is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate but it is not for me  the final straw was that i asked for extra cash for easter gifts the clerk at the register said there was a 150 limit the atm terminal said 100 and the manager said 50i thought they should get their act together  best to stay with weavers way or whole foods or wegmannsdelivery issues caused our pizza to be over 30 minutes later than the estimated delivery date  pizza finally arrived and was warm at best  wont be ordering from this location againaverage food with a really good location i went for breakfast once and lunch another time breakfast was average same with lunch which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours for the lunch visit we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich the menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing everything was bland and under seasoned wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk but seemed friendly when they approached our table food wasnt bad but the only reason id really go back is because of the location and if i was in a hurry no other reason to really go back and i live in the immediate areamy fiance and i live in west chester which has awesome brunch spots but we were meeting up with some friends so this was a good middle ground  this cafe had good reviews so we figured to give it a shot  we were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from  the food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable but nothing out of this world  we probably would have considered to go back if it werent for the service  immediately after our food was brought to our table the check was placed down never asking us if we were going to want anything additional  we sat down at 1100am the food came out pretty quickly but by 1200pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner  there were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down but for some reason it had to be our table  i could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line but there were several open tables and only 5 people not groups waiting to be seated  we were meeting up with friends we had not seen in a while and it was unfortunate to be rushed out after only an hour  needless to say we will not be backim being generous by giving this restaurant 2 stars the service was so appalling that the fact that the food was actually ok is this places only saving grace i think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening we were never greeted after we were seated we had to ask the maitred if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked once we finally ordered we were out of water after asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived and from that point until after we received our food we never saw our waiter again i asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when i told him i didnt want it any more he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket not my problem we were never asked if we wanted dessert we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didnt need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience as if he was going to get a tip in the first place getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did i would say dont expect a lot from this mediocre italian placewas not a fan of their cheesesteak their wiz sauce was mustard based and it was not terrible as a sandwich itself but mustard is not the flavor one expects or wants in a cheesesteak it was overwhelming and not goodlove the greek salad pizza is above average service ranges from okay to worst on the face of the planetnice staff but the last two visits ive made here they have been unable to serve shakes i understand things happen but two times in a row they didnt tell me this before starting my order either times the first time they didnt even take my order for 15 minutes as i sat at the speaker the manager patrick was very apologetic about the situation and offered me two free shakes on my next visit wondering if ill ever be able to redeem themused to love this place but the service and fish isnt what it used to fish didnt taste fresh  and color was pale on the maguro shrimp wasnt deveined and you could see the black spots on the shrimp tempura role the red lotus continues to be a favorite and tastes great hopefully this place turns around love the atmosphere and locationafter a bad storm temporarily shut down our newtous favorite coffee shop pagoda i decided to give this spot a try  wont be back  heres why  location look parking in town can be difficult  that is no different here  i found a spot nearby but ive talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here  just luck of the draw  beautiful gardens and homes to look at duh so just enjoy the stroll  im not applying this towards my overall scoring but im noting it so you know that i know that you know what the dealio is  atmosphere dead silent  seriously  so  freaking  quiet  if you need to study then youve found a winner  if you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot  when i walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because i made an actual loud noise and it startled them  not the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity  chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest   after i got my coffee from the huffy barista more on that in the next section because i should really review the product  service i got i chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness  that was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone  in a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker  look im nosy but i try to make it look like im not obviously nosy but it wouldnt have mattered here  this guy really got into it and wouldnt have noticed if the roof fell in  he certainly didnt notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a very personal phone call  after a few minutes i gave up pretending i wasnt watching and took in the show  after ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call heaved numerous sighs and helped them with the same care hed given me  spoiler alert it wasnt indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude  i watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit  not really relaxing ya  service i asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if i wanted medium dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me  if you dont know what you want in the first 2 seconds then theyll just make up your mind for you  okkkkkkk  i watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too  this guy wasnt really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasnt obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job  everyone has a bad day but dont take it out out on the customer to the extreme  i mean you dont have to kiss my butt but dont be all huffy and do not pick my coffee for me without asking  rude  coffee it was good  not great  not mindblowing  good  not as hot as i prefer but more heat than tepid  i ended up pouring about 14 out because i got some grounds in the finish  i couldnt find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask remember my first time here and being ignored i just used a straw  i hate to drink fairtrade coffee that wasnt my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when i dont have to  other i didnt eat so no word on that  bathrooms were clean enough  great restaurants nearby  i really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch  just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snarkas far as cheese goes they have a good selection but i would usually go next door  the mozzerela is good but often times sold out  i believe they only make cows milk and not buffalo mozzerela which is not my favorite for bread again i would go next door as well for groceries they have the best stock in the market  however the prices are pretty bad  if you are in a jam and need a single italian cooking ingredient they probably have it but youre probably over paying the staff is very friendly and helpful  they hang a lot of meat at the counter so the interaction at the counter is awkward because youre looking around hanging meati used to love to go to this place back in the late 1980s when it was on pine street then it was a great place for brunch and ice cream when i took my children to the current location a few weeks ago we had small ice cream cones that were overpriced and the staff was not terribly helpful the person who waited on me left my receipt with credit card info sitting on the counter while she disappeared outside to pick up lunch down the street however the real turnoff is the price go to franklin fountain instead they have a better selection at more reasonable prices in a more attractive settingwe discovered this place on our gps at the last minute so i didnt have time to yelp it since my phone doesnt have the app for it anyways this place is inside a nice place on the pier to where there are lots of tourist shops and other restaurants and a small aquarium we came here on cinco de mayo so because of that the margaritas were half off that day woo hoo   i forgot it was cinco de mayo and when i asked the waitress how much the margarita was she looked at me funny for some reason she kept on looking at me funny the whole time i asked her anything the rest of the time she tried to ignore me for no particular reason wth   on the bright side the margaritas were huge and blended just the way i like it they had lots of good flavors to choose from like pineapple banana strawberry mango and a few other fruity flavors at the time we were there only one other table was occupied i got the fried grouper sandwich which is a popular fish in fl it was just ok the service was slow and the waitress was weird she asked my husband if hed like more water a few times but ignored me completely i dont know why she was giving me an attitude as i wasnt rude to her at all   whatever mean woman haters like her suck the grouper sandwich was 995 fries didnt come with the sandwich and cost an additional 165 what a rip off fries should come with a full meal imho the margaritas were 400 each the soup of the day that my husband got was 595 for a large bowl and the key lime pie which tasted like lime cheesecake cost 595 the inside of the place is cute and there is an outdoor patio that faces the beach also there is a bar outside if you decide to eat here dont order the grouper sandwich it sucked and was dry but since i was hungry i ate it the margaritas were good thoughthe food is ok but is ruined by the awful atmosphere  two of the employees calling each other faggots and the deafening rap music with every other word being motherfr made it seem that they wanted customers to leave  order carryout or eat outside but eating inside is a miserable experience  note to employees keep your homophobic slurs to where customers arent able to hear themwhen i used to live in philly and did not have a lot of money i went to this indian restaurant its cheap and you get a lot of food while the quantity is great it lacks quality there are much better indian restaurants in philly this is not one of them you get what you pay for there used to be 2 other buffet indian restaurants near this onebasic donuts with strange names save your self the time and money and just to snhuncks or better yet worlds fair donutsterrible service food came out cold even after waiting about 1 hour during lunch way too pricey dont waste your timethe food is terrific  not just the food  the presentation  the arroz con pollo i ordered came to my table artfully arranged on my plate  and it was delicious as was every part of my order  why the two stars  as it seems others know all too well the service was abysmal  on one occasion we waited interminably for a table only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party when there had been two seats available the whole time    once we were served the waitstaff ignored us  this place seriously needs a management shakeup  it needs a better manager and a dedicated hostessoutside manageri find this place soso at best they have limited pizza the italian food is just ok service is good lots of parking i find it pricey for what you get im just not a fan lots of better italian places to eat in the reno sparks areahave had better gyros before my wife tried the doner plate it came with a nice salad4 different sauces fresh fries which for me were the highlight of the meal some lamb meat and 2 breads i tried the doner berlin which had almost the same contents except the fries stuffed inside a pitalike bread pretty simple nothing to really brag about  we went on a sunday evening around 630 pm and we were the only ones there  plenty of street parking available within a blocks range  staff were friendly but that doesnt compensate for the taste  didnt really live up to my expectations i must say maybe i had high expectations to begin withi tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like sprinkles but unfortunately i must say that i prefer sprinkles to the flying cupcakes first visually the frostingtocupcake ratio is too small  i like eating cake with frosting  i dont want to eat too much of cake without frosting  second im not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake  they overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting  third and this is the biggest negative the frosting does not melt in the mouth  its too thick and hard which means when you eat the cake with the frosting they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together you might as well eat them separately   i only tried their red velvet cupcake and maybe their other flavors are better but i think i make better cupcakes at home and i have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores  i dont think they are worth my 3 or my time waiting in line  their window displays are cute thoughi loved coming here when it was in the old location with my mother delicious food the manicotti is creamy not dry and flaky cheese like most places these days since they moved i have come whenever i was down to visit   this review is not about food which is very good but customer service i came in a few minutes after closing with people being served plates just starting to dig in not looking like they would leave any time soon   they wouldnt seat me they wouldnt even do take out i had wanted the special they probably could have scooped it from the tray no fuss no muss i only get here twice a year now   not even take out really guess business is greatthe apple pie was over run wcardamon or another similar spice the cherry must have been made wsour cherries the blackberry was good for a few bites  i regret the purchase especially considering the 12 price tagi went to college around the area so i loved corner bakery i would always get the cobb salad so i returned to reminisce unfortunately either my taste buds changed or their chefs got bad it is a mediocre spot similar to panera and cosiservice and coffee is not what it used to be i went every morning on my way into work for the last year recently ive been driving further out of my way to ensure a better cup of coffee and that my order would actually be correcti tried las cazuelas recently after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere  the first day i went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away  the food came out fast for how many people were there  however it lacked any real flavor  camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend  the seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland  still hungry we got the ceviche  this was the only good thing about our meal  water glasses werent filled at all during the meal even after the restaurant emptied  i decided to go back a few days later to give it another chance  we had a different server this time who seemed very new to the business  tables who sat after us had their order taken before  however again the food came out fast  wrong order first but quickly fixed  this time i got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish  again very disappointed  salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings  the shrimp had no flavour they were very much overcooked  the sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated  the veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas  there is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals  i will not be going back  i have had much better mexican off of the trucks in south phillyi did not have a problem with the restaurant my food was good i got the steak sandwich with the french onion soup the place was clean and presentable i would recommend the restaurant the only issue i had was the guy taking my order he needs to be retrained as i asked for my sandwich and for my french onion soup after that he told me the total without even allow me to get a drink after giving me my total i asked for a bottle water he seemed bothered that he had add something else to my order the guy just seemed like he didnt want to be there he is someone who i would want to interact with my customers i didnt get his name but i added a picture on herethis was a break point on our segway tour i ordered the strawberry iced tea and it kind of tasted like medicine  there is one unisex restroom and the lock is broken my friend almost opened the door on a guy who was occupying the roomeat there about every two weeks and it is either a training store of some kind or they are the weak store in the area the food is either super hot or just above cool the last time i went through the drive thu i told the guy to large size the order with a large size diet coke got a charged for it i received small fries and a small coke when i stated i paid for a large he just re filled a large cup and didnt give me the large friesand wasnt apologetic about the mistake eitheri usually dont write reviews of chains unless they are really great or really awful this cracker barrel verged on the latter  i had gone there lusting after a chicken fried steak and this is what i got  it wasnt bad nor were the scrambled eggs what did disappoint me were the grits and the gravy the grits were gummy and the gravy was kind of like paste with a hint of chlorine things that should be easy to make but just not good the biscuit wasnt   bad but even it was a tad strange being more crispy than i would expect  everything else was as good as you can expect in a chain but after this experience i think ill keep on lookingit pains me to write this but i fear i must  i used to really enjoy pk as a lively neighborhood spot with elevated pub food but yesterday in the early evening the place was overrun with drunken frat boys dropping fbombs at top volume and shouting about their exploits as rapists after multiple parties complained asked to be moved or left altogether what did the management do nothing just kept serving them more beer  its hard to justify 2530 dishes when the atmosphere is that of noclass dive bar and skip the octopus its overcooked and rubbery  to be fair the oysters were excellent hence the second staraverage american food with deluded aspirations  yeah i didnt hate it but i really do not care for eating at a restaurant and thinking yeah i can do this better at home with a blindfold and 1 hand tied behind my back ok maybe not but still  i had the chicken enchiladas didnt hate them or love them and they come covered in sour cream which is not stated on the menu so i ended up scraping off more than half the sauce while trying to get rid of the weird white stuff on my food the beans were good but i have a feeling most people would say they were under seasoned and under salted the rice was not good it was dry and boring  the bf had the buffalo burger i didnt try it as i do not eat buffalo he said it was seasoned different   the service was fine not stellar but not horrid  the beer was fantastic lol which made the dinner better  i would only eat here again if someone else wanted totook 45 minutes to get the order everyone that came in after seemed to get their food before us both the burger and the onion rings were cold when i got it felt like chewing through rubber after letting them know they did let us have the burgers for freefood was a bit greasy for my taste the grilled cheese tasted like it was cooked in pure butter fries however were better than most if you dont mind grease this is not a bad place to try but it would not be on my list of restraunts to return toserver was not good i had high expectations of the food but was let down i ordered the shrimp  grits and my partner ordered the traditional eggs bacon sausage and pancake breakfast my food arrived to the table cold and my shrimp where seasoned however the sauce was a big disappointment i would have sent it back however i was informed they ran out of grits essence fest weekendvery underwhelmed by this location i am a huge fan of the lexington location and was very excited to try out the nashville location the food items were not flavorful and pretty bland for the prices they did run out of key menu items and the service was pretty slow i did enjoy theyre outdoor seating area i was expecting more since i love the one in lexingtonopen air to the street is nice  tables are way too small and cramped together service was especially slow with half the place empty  bacon blood mary had a funny taste to it i probably got a bad batch  food was decidedly mediocre  nothing i can really recommend about coming herewe were greeted when we stepped through the door  we ordered our food  as we were watching the employees i was blown away by how slow they moved  i was really surprised because they were busy  not one of them had any hustle to them  some guy was sweeping the kitchen floor as the other staff were doing food prep  the burgers were ok  ive had better at smashburger  the price at blakes was about right for the quality of the food  the parking lot is so small im surprised there wasnt an accidenti ordered a blt from here and it came with bacon crumbles on my sandwich it was also made with shredded lettuce so the sandwich was just falling out all over the place i mean who makes a blt with crumbled bacon i would have never ordered that if they told me before i returned the sandwich and didnt order any further food wont order from here ever againi just dont get it waiting an hour in line for mediocre pancakes eggs that are under seasoned and bleh coffee i get its a nashville institution but our city has better to offer these daysmary browns tries to be kfc but lets face it no chicken place can compare toe greatness of the chicken gravy fries or burgers at kfc  i found their chicken to be dry and a bit tasteless the gravy wasnt great either in all honesty this place didnt really have a chance because from the moment i stepped in i was comparing it to kfc in every aspect and i love kfc when it comes to things chicken related   overall everything here is just sub par nothing to write home about and nothing to even recommendfood was great had bbq nacho as an appetizer great beer selection and great value for the price only bad experience was our waitress rushed us to get our order with 15 mins we had our food which being on a biz meeting made it where we had our food before our beermy first time and the band soul bus was nice why they call themselves soul bus i dont have a clue they werent playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them its like an after thoughtthey just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look  they knew they had a show when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act one cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all     i was told is was a classy placenot more of a old gentlemans club feel and outdated looking had the sushigag me i have had better wont order that again if i return to daddy jacks my guy aaron at kroger 79th and fall creek makes it better its yummy hes from thailand if that helps he is a sushi master   i also tried the buffalo shrimp okay im thinking these may be what im familiar with from my ann arbor michigan experience yuck  not even close no batter not even a dusting just 1250 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce its beyond laughablewhere is the skill in that  the corona is always tasty cant mess that upone thing for certain folksfool me once thats all you get outta me i dont fall for it twice when my money is involvedive only come for ice cream so i cant attest to this establishments other charms per the 4 and 5 star reviews   after dinner a friend of mine suggested ice cream and this was the place closest to the restaurant  the cafe area that housed the desserts was charming though in need of some refurbishing the entire area looked worn down  the ice cream was sosoi could get the same quality product at a grocery store plus the ice cream melted entirely too quickly my dining companion wasnt blown away by her selection either in addition to ice cream there were other baked goods  apple pie peanut butter pie etc but they didnt appear all that appealing investing in nicer display cases might help   i would give this place another shot since one visit doesnt mean mtjic isnt worth it but ill only stop by if im in the areayummy but the staff refused to make a frappacino i have ordered at least three times before at the same location and at least fifty times before in my lifetime at other locations also she didnt get half my order then while we waited for it she lectured me about how old my request was  oh come on i just want to go to home i wont be back but i will say once i got my order to where she would be willing to make it it was very goodoverpriced but hey their in the kop mall and everything is higher at least the service is pleasant i enjoy the dc chicken and tomato soup ive been there a few timesvery underwhelmed im confused on the high ratings so im wondering if we were here on an off day good smoked salmon croissants bad everything else here are the highlights waiter was confused and didnt know brunch menu very well menu said ask waiter for french toast and eggs benedict waiter says thats not the case but hed be willing to go to the bar and get for us carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same as did many of the dishes which was odd with amazing brunch options like mere bulles copper kettle ellendales etc id advise you to bypass this place did i mention we never got our drinks refilled and they bussed our table midmealthis place really isnt that good the atmosphere is sweet but the food is mediocre at best im always disappointed when i type in middle eastern and this pops up as the best available its definitely notmy husband and i stopped by to try angelos gyros and philly cheese steak this visit we opted for just the main items we did not get a fries both items were big i felt that you got what you paid for my gyro was stuffed with beef some of the meat was dried out the tzatziki sauce tasted like plain yogurt and sour cream mixed together i like my tzatziki sauce to have dill parsley or mint flavor to it i would have been happy with any seasoning the sub was also packed with beef my husband said it was decent sub we are both going to go there again maybe during the day when the kitchen is busy and items are fresherit was ok  i wont be going back people coming up to the table passing out flyers disrespectful the waitress not remembering our order just messy one and donei agree with some of the previous reviews which are less than satisfactory  the drivethrough was defectively designed and constructed   it is too narrow and too winding it shouldnt be too hard to reconstruct it to make it easier to get through more importantly the customer service needs to be improved  i went there recently and ordered coffee and clearly stated that i wanted it with no sugar  the girl at the window handed me the coffee which was loaded with sugar  i went through again and asked for what i ordered  another employee gave me another coffee made as i originally ordered but she made no apology and seemed annoyed this is at least the second time that i received an incorrect order at this location the other three mcdonalds locations i go to in less prestigious neighborhoods have much better customer servicefood was excellent server was good had purchased a groupon 35 off bill earlier that day as we were leaving town the next day when we went to pay the bill the server told us that she couldnt find our groupon and we had to write down the voucher number for her a few minutes later the manager came to the table and said your groupon isnt in our system so you cant use it and walked away we had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it again the manager was very rude and just said what does your groupon say it says you have to have a reservation and walked away again so yes the fine print said reservations required but this is not the type of place i can see anyone making a reservation and they never mentioned that until they couldnt find it in the system also i would have been fine with this if the manager had handled it politely his immediate aggressive attitude was very insulting and made it ver uncomfortable to the other guests who werent paying for the billordered online through yelp and got roast beef hoagie with extra swiss cheese i got the sandwich and it had american on it and only a few slices so i call them up and describe the mix up the guy on the phone says we dont have swiss despite it being an option on the online order form and when i asked why he didnt call to let me know he said oh someone probably tried to call you i had no missed calls on my phone so that obviously was a lie then i asked about the extra cheese that i ordered and he said all sandwiches get two slices of cheese and extra cheese means you get three slices  i told him that our definition of extra cheese is very different id like to say ill never order from here again but they have good food just shitty customer servicepoor at best had the odd mixtos taco plate a few pieces of meat set in and inch deep of bubbling cheese in a small square super hot skillet i picked out the meat which was there small portion disappointed at the price also  20 bucks for bad tacos   i did not say it out loud but the word came to mind as i pushed the plate awaygarbage not trying to be rude but being honest  if you are looking for authentic mexican food you will most likely want to skip by this one  very disneyesque it its mexican appearance all style no substancethis place has been featured on the food network which for me is a red flag  oftentimes these places are way over hyped and arent really that good  unfortunately this was the case for the pancake pantry  i am a pancake connoisseur and i can usually tell a good pancake by  looking at it yes im that good  one look at these pancakes and i had their number they were fluffy and doughy much like the ones at mcdonalds or any number of short order diners in the country  i personally like my pancakes with a light crisp edge which usually means they have been cooked in butter and they should be tasty before any butter or syrup is added not true of the pancake pantry just ok milquetoast even  good bacon thoughafter reading the reviews we decided to try it out  waited about 12  hour and was seated at a dirty table with remnants of left over breakfast and on one of the chairs too  told the waiter and she hurriedly wiped it down but the table was still sticky ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with no cheese and hubby ordered the big easy   sandwich came out with cheese on it and had to send it back hubbys eggs were under down  asked the waitress if the egg whites are suppose to be raw and really runny and she huffily said yesmmmm okayhad eggs at our restaurant establishments and when they make it over easy the egg whites are not raw and runny after that waitress didnt check up on us during our entire meal wouldnt go backthe food is over rated its good but not as to die for as everyone has told me this italian market  deli combo is jam packed with stuff everywhere making it nearly impossible to wait in line to order on an average day without touching anyone around you or anyone trying to press through to the patio i am very uncomfortable with strangers pushing me around while i try to figure out what food should be ordered at which counter struggling to glimpse the options behind the glass and understand what the ordering process is and which convoluted line is the one i need to be in the people taking the orders are not helpful in making the process clear assuming everyone has been here before and knows the deal they dont say for here or to go so they can heat up the food for you they dont have a clear spot at any of the counters for customers to go up to without having to push their way through a series of people who might have already ordered could be waiting to order or are trying to figure out what to order theres no way to tell one crowd from the other when you eventually figure it out the first time around and get your food you might have ordered multiple items but theres no trays to make sure you can carry all of the food out to the pay station and then to the patio or bags for to go ordersim pretty sure if you asked for one they could get one but i should not have to ask especially with my hand in a cast so you guard yourself against bumps as best you can to hope the food you waited so uncomfortably for doesnt get knocked out of your hands forget trying to make a single trip for food and drinks you wont make it speaking of their coffee bar theyre always super busy scrambling around and i got skipped over while waiting to order my drinks then it proceeded to take about 810 minutes to get my drinks and pay for them all whilst growing ever more hungry with each passing minute the pizza looked really good especially the chicken and vodka pizza but it wasnt very flavorful and its all extremely messy to eat the patio space is very limited so you might have to wait to get a seat or have a seat taken while you go inside for the necessary second trip the mist fans are a good concept but it does nothing but agitate me further as i try to keep napkins on the table the parchment paper from under certain foodssuch as pizza and pastries from flying away or up in the way as we ate and keeping my hair out of my face and food as the water droplets blow directly on everything being in a group with a friend in a wheelchair was difficult we had to somehow clear a space through the mass of indifferent people packed into the store from the front door to the back with too few handicap spaces having to park in the rear of the parking lot as a disabled veteran myself the overwhelming environment made me uneasy and the invasion of my personal space made me anxious and extremely uncomfortable add this to the inaccessibility of the entrance and exit due to the sheer volume of people going in and out of the limited doors and the maze of a parking lot through which my handicapped friend had to go through as cars pulled in and out without regard for their surroundings and it is a logistical nightmare i will not be returning despite my groups general enjoyment of the food and their continuing patronage the systems in place to get the food they enjoymostly the pastries are frustrating to them but they can overlook it i cannoti wanted to like izumi but didnt the hostwaiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue for the price i found the portion size to be very small  when paying 13 for a roll i expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree  the sea weed salad was nasty  although i felt like the waiter prepared us for the  others must have complained the ginger chicken took a long time to cook but i am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink  the flavor was ok but for 21 i would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken it was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt the saltiness was so overpowering that you couldnt taste anything else  as someone who lived in japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven i was underwhelmed by izumithe chick that works here is seriously retarded spacey as fck dosent pay attention and cant take an order   its iv so cant expect much   the pho was a little funky wanst a huge fan of the broth but it had a lot of veggies and tofu in it so i was fairly satisfied   iced coffee was good   mehill get to you when i can not the best way to greet paying customers if it was actually busy i could understand the servers frustration but it was dead in there at 4 in the afternoon pouring beers cant be that stressful thankfully the young lady at the counter was helpfulasked my husband on his way home this evening from work to stop by taco bell to grab me an order of nachos bell grande with chicken and guacamole so he brought it home and i was excited to eat it as i started digging through all this goodness i realized there were only but 67 whole chips in this entire plate the rest were a bunch of bits and pieces of chips sort of the last bits at the bottom of the bagcontainer i would hope whoever assembled this plate of nachos would realize that the bits and pieces of chips defeats the entire purpose of this meal disappointed hopefully they can do betteri really am not sure how subway maintains restaurants in the philadelphia area when there are so many good hoagie places out there  everyone knows what a subway sandwich tastes like  mehthe pizza is completely tasteless we ordered 4 different pizzas to try and all were bad the dough and sauce actually have no flavor its too bad i was so excited to have a good fast pizza place but this is not thatthis is the second time we tried turning point at this location the first time we had a long wait for food after ordering this time we had an even longer wait of over 40 minutes i had the omelette skillet and there was hardly any egg in it i felt like i was eating chopped onions and chopped tomatoes my wife had a blt and had a hard time finding the tomato and the avocado that was supposed be on it overallthe experience was stressful mainly because of the long waiti visited this location on several occasions this last week and was thoroughly disappointed on every visit from employees too busy joking with each other to help customers to waiting for my drink because they made the drinks and food for their regulars first to having an employee offer to help then walked away from the counter to go do something else which resulted in my having to bet back into line and wait again my vanilla latte is what you would expect from a starbucks consistent and good but the customer service will keep me from coming backchecker was very rude asking us two of us bagging to pack our 250 bags more quickly  i spoke with management about this as it was not our fault that we have to bag our own groceries to save a few bucks  as ive recommended several people there as being a bright and happy service agents just as much as ill complain about bad servicei was so excited when this place opened a few years back  for some reason it took me forever to get there to try their stuff  all and all its ok  the bagels are not great  do yourself a favor and go the bagel factory about a mile down the road  they have authentic ny style bagels this place does not  the doughnuts are good  not great  somewhere between dunkin donuts and a true bakery type of taste  if you are going to partake go with the maple bacon barits the best on the menu  bottom line from me no on bagelsmeh on doughnuts  ill probably be back but would not seek it outsimilar to below reviews i was not impressed at all after getting super excited about a new local bbq spot you just simply cant call something pulled pork and then throw tough chewy cubes of tasteless meat onto a roll i had to throw it away it was that bad the redeeming quality the sides really nicely done fresh cut fries and mac but come on dukes  step up your game man as i want to see a local spot do wellthis place is sub par at best ive had better pancakes at my local diner i ordered the blueberry pancakes thinking they would be these fluffy pancakes oozing of warm delicious blueberries well they were about silver dollar size and had like 3 blueberries per pancake i kid you not dont get duped like we did go somewhere else not even close to worth the waitso billingsgate used to be a sit down meal experience  it was a place where i could take out of town visitors for some really good fresh fish    i was a little disappointed to find out that you go up to the till place your order and pay for your meal before you sit at your table  so here is another situation where if you dont have cash on you you are expected to tip before you have even had your meal    the one server that they had on staff that night was very rushed and i felt rather bad for her  we patiently awaited our turn to order    you have a full view of the kitchen so that you can watch your food being prepared if you wish  it looked like the cook took pride in what he was doing    there were two of us  we ordered a batch of steamed mussels the deep fried oysters and the seafood platter  the oysters and the sampler are deep fried    your meals are at least brought out to your table  the steamed mussels were served in a red sauce which i am going to guess had a tomato paste base to it  the mussels were tender and the sauce was okay but it was nothing spectacular  as you can see from the photo i posted you are given a tiny sliver of bread and a single butter pat  dadeos are much tastier    the deep fried oysters were really dark they looked burnt  they were juicy though and served with french fries and an inhouse made seafood sauce   the seafood platter was again deep fried  it contained 2 shrimp 2 scallops 1 oyster 1 cod  fries  this was also served with an inhouse made seafood sauce and no tartar sauce in sight  white and malt vinegar is supplied on the tables  the cod was overcooked to the point of being mushy and falling apart  the rest of it was edible but really plain    billingsgate you really need to bring the menu ordering back again  it would have been nice to have more that one beer with my meal and it also would have been nice to have a server to ask for water and tartar sauce    i do need to note that the retail side of billingsgate is quite nice  the fish and seafood is all on ice in the coolers or you have several frozen choices as well  there is live lobster and crab in the tanks ready to take home  they have a wonderful selection of purity products from the east coast and everything that you would need to make a great newfie jiggs dinner on a sundayi want to know what happened to this place a year ago i would have given it 5 stars but now i cant the biggest difference is their chicken breasts i bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them its almost as if they cut the center out and theres only a little meat on both edges and a whole lot of breaded bone it was ridiculous of course like an idiot i thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week same thing the other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty i dont know whats going on but i would advise you not to buy the breasts even if youre a fan of white meat theyre the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all otherwise the service is ok and when you call ahead its ready for pickup about 75 of the timepretty decent ice cream but lackluster food  got a tuna sandwich here online for pickup and when i get there they told me that they forgot to tell me that they dont have tuna in the restaurant tonight and can cook me something else  so i was forced to choose another item on the menu of comparable price for them to cook  i ended up with a grilled cheese which is teeny tiny and dry    come here for ice cream but this place is definitely not more than just ice cream  all it really offers is ice creamnot pet friendly which is quite odd since its a farm although no signs state such a thing everyone was friendly except for one old bat cashier i assume she was some type of manager making sure nobody was going to leave with a smile on their facefood was nothing special i think this place gets a lot of hype because they push alcohol really hard to make it have a fun vibe i mean its not bad but its not worth the price eitherfood is okay but service is too bad cold face arrogant tone dont like it at all never visit back probablysince i dont live in reno i live in las vegas i didnt know anything about the concert venues up there i heard a radio commercial  picked up tickets to the halestorm preceeded by eve to adam  in this moment show a couple weeks ago while i was up there so for the good  bad venue floorplan is horrible its long and narrow which means the majority of attendees cannot even get a glimpse of the stage i know i dont go to concerts to watch it on a tiny little tv screen the first floor is so crowded that once in the door it was a bear trying to get to the bar the bartenders were so rude too the over21 lounge upstairs looked nice but again good luck trying to see anything  i was lucky though there was a small group that went together  a couple of them let me wiggle up to the rail so i could see the bands play a few songs the bar and bartenders up there were great not knowing the area it took me forever to find a place to park i ended up at a casino parking garage a few blocks away i wasnt impressed that the entrance was in an alley but the will call lady was really nice i really enjoy the more intimate venues but this place was not for mehave been about 6 times and felt a decline in the service and food each time the beer will always be quirky and tasty but the foodnot worth it for the price server seemed to be on their first day and didnt know much about the beer  never the case if you sit at the bar so head there if just looking for some innovative beersthe food was good but service was ridiculous a friend and i had bought a coupon book in support of the local high schools baseball team one coupon being burger up the coupon gave us a free milkshake with a purchase of a burger each of us being on separate checks and had our own separate coupons the red headed server approached us with attitude and poor service not even asking us what milkshake we wanted when she had done it to the table next to ours this was extremely frustrating and i will not be returning to burger upthe regular pizza wasnt hotnready we wouldve needed to wait 1520min for 1 pizza thats crazy for a place that offers hotnready pizzaa group of us recently stopped n for dinner while we were seated right away it took 15 minutes to place a drink order they were not real busy either the beers were great as usual the food quality was another story i order the pork steak it was as thick as in the past it was way over cooked to beijing like the old saying dry as a bone a friend ordered a medium burger the cow was killed twice it was well done my girlfriend the pretzel chicken it had no seasoning and dry  a totally unexpected disappointing experiencegot there and ladys was not welcoming but neutral asking if we were ready took a while then finally i ordered a special chicken sandwhich  9 almost 10 dollars for that lemonade and friesmedium sat down and my order was ready in less then a minute  excited because i was starving then upon opening it looked so dryyyy tasted dry outside was crunchy friends burger was greasy like dripping grease fries and drink was bomb didnt bother complaining just ate and left had to go to pole vault summit decided to leave a review insteadi really wanted bagel and lox but they were out of bagels so i opted for the lox eggs benedict it came out with the lox fried yuck since i wont send anything back unless it is inedible i lived with it i just dont understand frying lox who does that  otherwise this is a good diner with attentive wait staff but i just cant get past the fried lox  lox by definition are not cooked but smoked only if it is going to be fried then its just salmonhonestly this place is hit or miss i always get the same thing jr bacon cheeseburgers and fries sometimes the fries are hot but alot of the times they arnt ill either get a good burger or like the other night a burger w green tomatos but then again you get what you pay for at a fast food restaurantthe customer service at cafe deluxe is poor my party waited a long time to be seated and then to get our drinks and then our food and then at the counter to pay our check our server was curt and not polite   as for the food my partner ordered the scramble and said it lacked flavor however the cinnamon swirl french toast i ordered was deliciousfood was nothing special  sides were cafeteria style nothing seemed home made  fried chicken was the best thingi ordered a turkey burger twice from here and twice it was raw in the inside and the messed up my order of fries every time im therevery attractive space and kind staff but it did not make up for poor food i ordered a breakfast salad that was supposed to have some roasted potatoes on it they were cold and rock hard felt like theyd been frozen and taken straight from the freezer it was supposed to have 2 poached eggs on the salad but ended up with only 1 yolk and some extra bits of white my boyfriends meal was forgotten and then when he asked about it and they eventually prepared it what i think was supposed to be a warm sandwich contained cold buffalo chicken that seemed it shouldve been heated sadly wont be returningthere are some days when you are so desperate for a cup of coffee that you will pay a fortune so imagine my surprise on one of these days when the total for a cup of large coffee landed me less than three bucks in of all places clayton i had heard some mixed reviews about this small chain and i decided to give it a go since i was in the area i honestly have tasted better and the buzz i got didnt last very long for a large and on top of that i didnt get the best service during the 2 or 3 minutes i was in the shop hmmid rate this below average mexican food  my fajitas tasted like they were made with ketchup   its worth the short drive to red mesa or the longer drive to carmelitas though the reviews on yelp arent positive i liked carmelitas alotsome of the food was cold they didnt have any of the sides i wanted there were flies everywhere while eating i wouldnt recommend dining maybe just take out  wouldnt dine here againnice set up decent atmosphere and friendly staff immaculate clean bathroom but was truly served the foulest cup of iced tea ive ever had in my lifetime  i swear im not being hyperbolic when i say my drink tasted like a vanillaflavored 1970s era cough drop    i can do better next time i willsuper slow service salads are not very good and really over priced wont be returningfood was good but overpriced  sandwiches came with stale chips  although we didnt try any the beers may be good but a glass of the house chardonnay which was sweet and simple was 8  likewise mixed drinks were 9 for a small drink  our tab for 2 was 85 with tip and included 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks apiece  nice atmosphere but wont be a place we visit often if we do indeed returnthe food was greathowever the wait staff was so bad it was incredible  he not only insulted us as we complained about our 2 hour wait for our entrees but insisted we werent there that long and that we were just hangry  he said its okay youre mad i understand youre hangry  never did a manager come to talk to us even after a guest in our party went to talk to the chefsthey were dumbfoundedbecause we realized the kitchen never had our order one bad server shouldnt describe a restaurant however the manager should have come and the server should accept his ignorance  really poor experience i have to agree with john n  this was probably the least friendly and least efficient subway i have ever experienced  im not sure if the employees dogs had all just died or what the deal was but they barely said hi and barely made eye contact    i have been to many great subways in my day  this is certainly not one of them  they get two stars only because my sandwich was good  but when there is a subway on nearly every street around vandy you better believe i wont be coming back to this onewholes food have a good variety of organic food they always seem to be up to date as well i love that their seafood is always fresh and i love making fresh roasted peanut butter for my children the only thing i can say is if your black beware of the security guard that will follow you around the whole store the entire timethis was my first time at cheddars and it was not a very good impression decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess who looked to be all of 14 our waitress arrived and thats when it went downhill maybe she was new idk but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order i asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem i was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra so i went with catfish instead wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well what next extra for silverware there were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either anyways the food came quick and was tasty portion size was very good as well the waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad which was supposed to be on the side was nonexistent about 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar we were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check during that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door when he left the girls continued the hug fest in between customers coming in such love amongst the staff 8 minutes later the check arrived but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server too going over the bill at least i didnt get charged for the beer that is still in their tap overall i feel this place is overrated and itll probably be quite awhile before i go there again by the way if youve happened to live a long life or have served our county they dont care neither senior not military discounts are offered bottom line food was a hit service was hits okay if you do not have a car and need some photos after a crazy night i guess this would be the best spot available in isla vista  the broth needs depth there is some flavor but you need to add tons of spices and other sauces to make it worth whilewaitresses are great but kitchen staff needs to pay better attention to orders  my food allergy could have caused me issues and i know waitress noted my order down correctly  plus they didnt get orders correct at neighboring tables as welljust personal preference i guess but there was too much sauce so it was all goopy and too overpowering of a flavour and for my third visit i ordered a dirty chai latte which took almost 10 minutes to create despite being the only customer in there and it was topped with fresh grated nutmeg which gave it an astringent flavor which was so hard to choke down that i threw the cup away barely a third of the way down big waste of money   note ive had a dirty chai here once before without the nutmeg and with a different barista creating it and it was truly one of the best id had  the short of it make sure they dont put nutmeg on it because it does not taste as goodthis location has always had good food and service in the past but my last 3 purchases have been awful  i used the drivethru about once a week but no more  food has been cold the beef was colder than the lettuce  they have left out napkins and also no sauces which were asked for  i was used to good service here and never needed to check my order when handed to me  just tired of the sloppiness and rude service  hate to see this location fall apart  i wont be backsmells like something burnt in here full montegu sandwich was good but i am used to bigger sandwich at this price  nothing to really impress me here  i wont want to come back any time soon voluntarily however ive been told the thanksgiving sandwich is memorablefood was ok seemed to lack flavor potato salad was blah they forgot to use our free appetizer yelp coupon but since husband checked us out i shouldnt complain but it was a slow sunday so not sure why  lots of other options on the river front to try  so in general not great but not horriblei was in the neighborhood so i thought id stop buy to pick up some pork butt and some pork fat for making some sausage  they actually argued with me and wouldnt go to the back to grab me the fat  they had no idea that i was not making pork sausage but just using it as a filler meat to get up to the correct weight for the recipe i should have known the quality of the business when i walked in and all of the refrigerated displays were empty and the only other customer in there was only picking up jugs of water lolprices are higher than other close by stores  we decided to stop in and purchase an advertised street sign advertisement beer on a whim  this would have been a good purchase but they didnt have it in stock  call it false advertising bait and switch or poor inventory planning as i stopped in a couple of days later and still no sale item  this is not my first choice rarely stop in due to the repeated nature of my concerns  i assume they are less competitive due to their small footprint so while i can accept higher prices as a result the store should yank its advertising if it cant fill ordersthe food i ordered was decent but the wait time for my familys order was ridiculous we waited almost 1 hour after placing the order for 2 orders of fish tacos a childs fried fish and a burger it was 200 in the afternoonthouroughly disappointed by this one i litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night i stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices   my stops included samosa deb 10 for curry chicken with rice and samosa  horrible rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable it was mush there was no curry it taste more like a bland indian dish which i have never had the spices were there but there was no salt the dosa was mushy it was disgusting   next stop ktown korean fried chicken 8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked korean style save your time and your money and go straight to cafe soho the wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken what a let down   then on to the cow and the curd 14 for glorifried cheese and a frozen lemonade it was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick sadly enough this is what i enjoyed the most what left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck i was with friends from atlanta who came to philly for the night market so i wanted to share i asked the owner for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply no we have no extra dishes try using a napkin as i looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers wow way to loose a customer buddy   now on to relish 8 for chicken in waffles yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles add a pat of maple syrup butter on top yum yum sounds amazing right yeah thats what i was thinking until i bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the disgusting taste of dark meat chicken my entire body quivered as i spit the waffle in to a napkin  come on relish you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meatin the trash it went  i will not be returning to this night market i saw the reviews but i really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt we were so disappointed we ended up driving to jims steaks in west philly to satisfy our food cravings i will give the one in chinatown a try in the fall my suggestions to my foodies avoid this onejust finshed lunch buffet at this restaurant most of the trays are empty  and no one bothers to fill thempathetic servicepathetic food nothing is fresh everything is re heated and that is so clearly understood the food definitely did not live up to my expectations the service was good despite the long wait and huge crowd but the food itself was subpar i ate the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a crab sandwich the bisque was too tomatoey and i didnt even see and lobster chunks in it and the bread bowl was not fresh the crab sandwich was decent but flavorless you could hardly tell that it was crab my mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious though ridiculously overpriced at 20 the clam chowder was thick and buttery and the bread bowl was once again stale overall a very disappointing meal that was insanely overpriced such a bummerbecause of this panera breads proximity to king of prussia costco and the movie theater ive been here at least 4 times each time some different person manages to get my order wrong   dont get me wrong i love panera bread but the service that this location provides is horrible the first time i ordered a panini and i stood there for at least 15 minutes before i went up and asked about my order it turns out it never went through although the charge on my credit card certainly did the mistakes made in the secondthird orders were also relatively small but irritating to fix how hard is it to take an order for a salad or a sandwich usually the place is pretty empty too   i think the 4th time is the last straw they messed up the salad that i ordered i asked them to omit some ingredients because of allergy restrictions and when i checked the receipt saw they charged me for extra  so i got back in line holding my salad like a huge idiot and after a 20minute wait even though there were only 2 customers ahead of me it took 5 different people another 20minutes to solve the issue in total i probably spent about 45minutes just waiting to get the right food they refunded me the extras charge but not the cost of the total bill about 8 im trying not to gripe about 8 bucks but a 45minute wait is kind of ridiculous  passing on this panera forever  hopefully other paneras in this area will be betterordered the full slab for 26 expecting the meal to feed at least four people  although the meat was plentiful it comes dry with a small container of bbq sauce  you run out of sauce about a quarter of the way through even if you are being stingy with it also comes with beans and toast but only enough for one person  wont be coming back  we have way better bbq here in tucson and much closer tooru sans is interesting to say the least my wife and i are regular sushi eaters and we always somehow end up back at ru sans i am beginning to think its because it is close to where we live  positives the menu is extremely creative and gargantuan i love that they have some cheaper options and plenty of variety  negatives ru sans has the worst service i have ever had on a typical dinner night out with my wife even on odd weekdays it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there the waiters seem to either disappear or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected on many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server  the food is good but seems to take a longer time to come out than usual places they have recently raised their prices a little so be prepared to eat 50 worth of sushiim sad to report that taste of havana left me a little disappointed when i heard that a new cuban place had opened in indianapolis i was so excited that i had my wife take me there straight from the airport funny enough she was picking me up after my trip to miami so cuban food was already on my mind  the fricase de pollo chicken fricassee was just okay it wasnt particularly flavorful and the bed of rice it came on was soggy   we also ordered a beef pastelito but got chicken and while thats obviously not a terrible mistake the pastelito itself was pretty bad much too sweet and not in a good way it was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago and that have just been sitting around since then   the cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch but ultimately this also left us pining for miami the foamy top was exceptional and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out but it just didnt have the richness that we were expecting   it should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable we particularly liked the crocodilethemed wall painting over the front door   underwhelming on a number of levels and nowhere equal to the hype   the cuban place on moller and 38th is far superiorthe food is good sometimes and sometimes subpar i do love the chocolate chip cookies everything is overpriced for the quality also they say they are open until 4 but when i went to grab a late lunch to go was informed that they close the kitchen at 2 i didnt see this info anywhere online so ended up leaving upset with no food also others have mentioned the lack of a bathroom this is a serious issue i was told to go to the library which i found out was closed after i friggin walked there so although ive gotten some good sandwiches and cookies it just isnt worth the hassle or unreliability in quality to come here againits been a long long time since i have eaten  the pancake pantry so with friends driving through we decided to meet them there we arrived  about 1000 am and the line was down 21st avenue about 100 feet we waited for about an hour to get inside if you go to pancake pantry expect it when we got through and left about 1230 pm the line was still about 50  75 feet down 21st avenue  quite frankly im not sure why local people  others crave pancake pantry the food is ok its a decent breakfast but its also over priced for the quality and quantity ive had better  more pancakes eggs and meat etc at cracker barrel and other restaurants dont get me wrong i enjoyed the breakfast but the quality and quantity is definitely not up to the hype the sentiment for the other 3 people was about the same  the service we received was exceptional the waitress was on the ball serving us coffee when we needed it got our orders properly right and kept making sure we were being treated properly  the total bill including tax and tip was 6200 for 4 peopleeverything is great except the ac kicks at 10am to where it makes it too cold to hang out it has been this way for months and im not sure why they dont change it i would rate 5 stars if the ac functioned properly please fix itthis place has wonderful ambiance and is spacious for group dining the food and service however are terrible everyone had something that tasted funky or didnt come right with the kitchen upstairs and our table downstairs every problem took twice as long to work out as well it is way overpriced i dont recommend it and wont go backive been going to this place since it was just the casino as i was not of age for the glory days of seminole bingo the hrc has had good moments and its had bad moments yes it is often very smoky if this bothers you you may not enjoy the odor the drinks are expensive but thats to be understood given that they arent your local podunk dive the casino has always been relatively clean when ive gone for anyone complaining that the machines must be rigged because they arent paying out the reason that they are there is to take money from you and give it to themselves payout is not guaranteed and you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose  as to the service my reactions have taken a steady downward turn since opening my first time there my date and i enjoyed dinner at floyds and were served by a young man named kurt so good i remember his name all these years later and were happy with the food and elated with his service on other occasions i would go either alone or with coworkers as my coworkers and i got out of work late the casino was a place we could go to eat drink and make merry when we would arrive during late hours and eat at the open restaurants we were treated poorly by people that acted as though they did not want to be there and the food served was substandard i am not a particularly picky eater but a slab of bendyourfork frozen pie or green beans that hold a similar temperature to refrigerator from whence they probably came shouldnt be what i expect from a place that charges what the hrc does if the restaurants dont want people to come in late they shouldnt be open and if the employees dont want to work late hours they should find other employment as for the casino employees on the floor i have a generally neutral impression as i dont bug them and they dont bug me but one particular instance stands out on a brief jaunt through the slot machines on my way to dinner at the casino i won a hair over 10 i kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashiers desk asked if i was serious about wanting this paltry sum surely if that is the attitude of the casino they wouldnt mind if i lost 10 and just took my money back because they have far more than i do and shouldnt mind me keeping that i dont care if i won a nickel or thousand dollars the only thing people working the cage should say about your winnings is congratulations  as to the new parking fee im not looking to get the same canned response from their rep that everyone else has been getting hrc can say anything they like about security or bringing themselves in line with other hotels ive never had a security problem there and a business should be going out of the way to make themselves different from others anybody with a lick of sense can see that the reason for implementing the parking charge is as a way to keep the rabble out of the casino as ive said i tend to go at night due to keeping late hours and brother some of the folks that come late at night are skeevy as all get out these folks come in already drunk annoy other patrons and spend nearly no money the casino also makes no money off frugal folks that come in and take up seats while making the smallest bets possible and pinch pennies so hard that abe lincoln filed a restraining order implementing the parking fee is a way to keep the cheap or disruptive people out while not deterring the relatively small percentage of patrons that spend a lot and make up the majority of their profit my main concern with using this tactic to keep out undesirables is that eventually the groups will realize that they can save the money by packing folks in to a minivan and splitting the cost between six or eight of them only to have another pack of drunks or misers do the same and rather than ten individuals taking up ten parking spots and ten places at the casino youre have sixty or more individuals taking up ten parking spots and sixty or more places at the casino  my rating on the facility is not incumbent upon the parking fee and reflects only the quality of goods and services provided a place that prides itself on being different should be different in the right ways and as it is this facility is in dire need of a uturni put off trying p  k because of the 12 price tag on the burger even though its been recommended  yesterday i decided id try it out for drinks  the mark up is almost as bad for drinks  however the real turn off was the service  the hostesses and waitresses were all aloof and unengaged  hypothesis 1 management sought to hire snooty staff  hypothesis 2 they are made to dress them in quite constraining clothes and they can hardly breathe enough to talk to customers  who knowsi got a concrete that was supposed to have reeses and banana when i got it it was melted and disgusting with literally 2 small pieces of reeses and maybe 15 of a banana had a minty taste too which is not what i expected haha disappointing for my first time at this place wont be going backi want to like this place since its right around the corner from me but its just less than mediocre sushi and way overpriced the rolls are undersized and the fish is not very fresh good location bad sushi worse pricesi saw big data when they came to town at the knitting factory some things  the area is really skeazy i am happy reno is trying to change the image of the city but that cannot be accomplished over night and this place is super creepy  the sound quality is horrible if you want to really hear the band you paid to see go somewhere else the building is not shaped right for a concert venue and because of it the sound will sooner bust out your eardrumsi was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if i was sure i wanted to order so ill take my business elsewhere but i hear the food is really goodone might want to skip the coffees made in their machine i had a cappuccino made twice and both times there were grounds in the bottom i returned them  i was told they are getting a new machinevery slow service for a very simple order food quality was average compared to other kfcsi really wanted to like this coffee but obviously i didnt  the location was nice and had a parking lot which is important because parking in the trendiest area of santa barbara is a b  the vibe was typical coffee shop dcor and the service was good  i just couldnt get over the finish or aftertaste of the coffeeit seriously pains me to be writing this update i loved this giant like in an emotional way and i still love that its clean and has a lot of variety and great sale prices so on and so forth and what have you however im sorry to say that i can no longer frequent this store due to its poor customer service i dont know if they got a new manager or what but in the past few months things there have gone seriously downhill   there are rarely people available to bag groceries which in turn slows checkout lines while the cashier and customer both try to do it more than once ive gotten in a line with a bagger only to have that person walk away after finishing up with a customer   in this same time period they have also gotten into the habit of stocking shelves during high traffic times  like sundays at 11 i get that items need to be on shelves but ive seen them rearranging shelves during this time too  not necessary it doesnt appear that theyre just filling up on out of stock items  there are big carts and empty boxes in nearly every aisle at times it causes so much traffic in the aisles and too many times you cant reach what you need   my biggest complaint is about the deli though one of my favorite things about this store is the ability to order your deli items from a kiosk do all of your shopping and then whip around and pick up your items  no need to grab a number and wait this kiosk allows you to specify how you want your items sliced i always choose very thin and i used to get it for several months now however my meat has been cut so thick that even my carnivore husband is grossed out by it yesterday i had enough and just left it there going then to a different store for those items   i wish this store had maintained the high quality experience it had in the beginning but unfortunately it hasnt and as a result its former biggest fan will be shopping elsewhereokay yes i know its a brewery but the smell of hops was so strong and overwhelming the night we ate there we were unable to enjoy our meal my husband spent the whole time notsosubtly with his shirt over his nose and my kids kept begging to leave i thought the tacos were decent but we couldnt get past the smellnashville is challenged when it comes to italian food in my opinion this restaurant is no exception disclaimer i lived near several great italian places in nyc so i am spoiled that said la tavola is still below what i feel should be an average experience   if you have high standards for italian food you will likely be disappointed the recipes arent traditional the marsala so many people rave about is a creamy sauce for example rather than a nice light marsala wine based sauce if you are looking for something a little better than pizza hut you will be happyif you want to have some shake late in night go for it i wont recommend it for other food menu if there are other options around place we ordered meal deal but the server didnt get it complete thinking of saving money by not getting soda two of my friends got cold burger and fries and instead of making fresh new ones they just warmed it up in the small ovenah this is what you get from such places luckily my burger and fries were hot so i  wasnt as mad as them veggie options are ok again go only if there is no other option there are many other places aroundmaybe i ordered wrong but after my first visit i cant say this will be in my rotation when im craving a trendy acai bowl  i stopped in and they werent too busy four people in line ahead of me and it still took me about 20 minutes to order and get my bowl which seemed like a long time the menu was interesting since they offer other kinds of fruit bowls in addition to the traditional acai bows and smoothies i decided to be creative and ordered the kale bowl which was blended with fruit and came with granola and honey on top my bf ordered smarter and got the beach bowl which is one of their best sellers and added peanut butter for an extra charge note that the toppings cost extra here which explains why the bowls are more affordable at 795 each i have to stay my kale bowl was watery and lacked flavor i also didnt love the granola they used i wondered if my error came from ordering kale but i tasted my bfs best seller and it definitely wasnt up to par with juice nashville or franklin juice company both were quite bland and seemed to be more ice than fruit  i was starving and it was a good sized bowl especially for the price but i have to say that it left much to be desired ill probably give them a few months before giving them a second chancethe food was good thats the only reason they got 2 stars the hostess was less then enthusiastic and barley greeted us when we were being seated the waitress only checked on us once after serving our food the hostess came around with water and saw my husbands glass was empty but he had sprite rather than getting one for him or informing the waitress we waited for another 10 minutes and flagged the waitress down for the bill also some attention needed to be given to cleaning all the doors were covered in handprints the floors had swirl marks from mopping with a less than clean mop and the light fixtures and air vents were dusty we arent from the area and had to decide between barbecue and the chinese place in the plaza should have gone with chinesemediocre food decent service  excellent fountain coke  my advice if you have to eat here use the salsa which was way too sweet to add some flavor to the rest of your meal  i was amazed by how many restaurants are in this shopping center the fact that estelas is still in business is bad commentary on the rest of themfood was good i had the buffalo chicken soups kids loved the grilled cheese and the bread it came on  service was not good  never offered refills although glasses were empty a long time  i had to take our glasses over to the bar on the other side for a refill  we asked for ketchup several times i went and asked another table to borrow theirs so the kids could eat their fries  the lady who brought our food did not say a word just dropped the food on the table and turned around  took forever to get the check after asking twice  the one waitress we saw on the way out said have a good night and she was the nicest person we ran into the entire eveningthis is the second time we are been there and i will not be going backmore and more underwhelming with every visit   the first time i came i enjoyed it charming quaint simple glass of wine good salad good times   return grainy bland mac and cheese still a gorgeous day another gorgeous glass of wine   third time and likely last visit french onion soup was poorlyflavored onion water with an abundance of cheese and crouton special chickenprosciutto creamy pasta was underseasoned but thank you for the salt and fresh pepper grinder at the table so i can season my own food its not like i just added a sprinkling of pepper to enhance there was absolutely no taste what i consider an abundance of salt was added  unacceptable for a 1750 plate of pasta chocolate mousse was welltextured chocolatey but could have been richer too sugary sweet    i will likely never experience this place for a fourth trip its just not good enough and who wants to go to a restaurant thats a crap shootcheck your bill  the service was just ok and so was the food  the big issue i had is when the check was delivered there was an aca surcharge     in case you were wondering what this is as i did its a surcharge the restaurant is sneaking onto the check to cover their expenses for the affordable care act ie obamacare  sorry but i pay almost 400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and i dont want to pay for others    i did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes  the manager did come to the table and told us the servers are required to tell us upon seating about the surcharge and that its posted on their menus  we were not warned ahead of time and when i asked to see the menu the manager just said hed take it off the check    we will not be returning  the only reason i am giving two stars is the server seemed like a good person and when the food is done right it can be tasty but there never seems to be any consistency to eitherwife and i tried this joint for the first time on a sat eve take outas its 5 min from our homewe are always trying new places and love that we had a new option for bbq close bystart with the ribs which were unfortunately short ribsdisappointingjust ok i would prefer regular porkbaby backs or beef as they have more flavorno real smoke tastefell right off bonethis should not bei like a little resistancethey added some bbq suace which didnt helpit wasnt that goodi prefer dry rubbed bbq on side  chile was real goodkale slaw was diff and okthe dressing was too thick and just too much of itpulled chicken tacos were very goodmac n cheese was okcorn bread was probably stalei hope it was because it was very drytaste was ok but man it was drymay or may not return to try some of the other options and beerthey should probably define the rib selection and i should have askedowners were very nice as well food was ready in less than 10mindecor was very nice good luck to themjkunmotivated employees  during lunch time they have 23 people operating the line other times usually 1 works the line and 1 sitsstands in the rear  false advertising  at the bottom of the receipt it asks you to take a survey for a free cookie after completing the survey i returned with my receipt only to be told that the manager does not allow free items i can pay full price instead  crowded seating  tables are just off the walkways if you sit against the wall on the left as you enter claustrophobia is inevitable as the line forms next to you   average food at best  they have no shame in pulling lettuce or turkey directly out of the bag under the counter no attempt to place it in the bins on the counter  parking  thats another beast in itself potholes faded linesmy boyfriend and i ate at in riva last night the decor and location is great for that id give it a 4 star  i ordered the hangar steak starter as i wasnt ravenously hungry and my partner ordered the margherita pizza the service was by the way very attentive and food arrived very fast my steak was raw tough and tasteless inedible i dont even think it was hangar steak it looked more like a sirloin tip took me 4 minutes to chew one small piece the salad it came with was tasty so i just ate that and told my waitress that the steak was lousy she offered to bring me something else but i refused the pizza was tasty and enjoyable but hardly memorable   to in rivas credit they did not charge us for the steak dish  we might give it another chance just becos we are local and becos we wont write off a place based on ordering two items the ambiance location service etc will probably convince us to try again in a while  if i could i would give it 25 starsnormally this hardees is quite good and the manager is wonderful he is always friendly and helpful and hard working  he food is usually good and fastthese morons they had working yesterday were awful they must be new or just have no business working infast food they took like twenty minutes to help each customer then got the orders wrongthen didnt even apologize to anyone for their mistakes you could tell they didnt care at allmy sweetheart and i came here for a quick lunch on a weekend day we were both in the mood for something different and wanted something quick and had a craving for something somewhat asian   the place was pretty dead only one other table occupied all other tables were clean and had no lingering bento boxes or empty soda bottles dirty tables is my biggest pet peeve in faster food establishments   we each ordered a bento mine with tempura and dumplings his with tempura and sushi they both came out looking quite appetizing and very generous   the beef teriyaki tasted like roast beef sandwich meat with bottled teriyaki sauce and the rice was cold and mushy likely over cooked my dumplings were bland and i gave them to the bf to finish the bento came with 3 and i only ate one the small salad of carrot and bean sprouts were probably the best thing in the box actually no the tempura yam was it was light and not overly greasy but still nothing to write home about as for the fruit well it was canned and all tasted the same syrupy and canny if thats even a word    service was average and price was not equal to value sadly i will not be back and would rather spend my 15 on edo japan or another fast food jointwatch out the espresso is super expensive the staff is nice enough building left over from big star days also nice but three shots of espresso will run you 345 the same drink at dutch bros will run you 150 at the most starbucks the expensive choice maybe 2 but nowhere in the valley will charge you above 3 for three shots of espresso just for the economy of it all id recommend going anywhere else not sure about the other drinks but my guess is if the pricing is scaled a fancy latte or two would run you a paycheck if you have extra cash around the house and are looking for ways to get rid of it go to brim if not get your caffeine elsewhereif you like really bad beer this is the place for you  i am not trying to be a beer snob but it just was not good  the food i cant comment on much  i did have a flatbread pizza which was very avgi am sorry to complain about such a beautiful place  the food we ordered was just lousy    the mac and cheese had very little cheese no flavor just some flavorless crab on a lot of breaded macaroni  the fish tacos were dry the cole slaw on them tasteless  we did have a very good bartender ryan so that is why there are some stars on this review  the chef needs to get with itwent here today for lunch my husband and i were quoted a 2025 min wait to be seated we were seated at the 20 min mark like your text system for that the wait is not what got the low stars   we were seated and our order taken within a few minutes of being seated our waitress stopped by our table around the 15 mins mark wait for food to tell us that our food was about to be out after waiting another 15 mins our food did not come out we kept waiting another 10 mins went by our waitress came by finally and apologized for how long it was taking i really dont like it when the wait staff says its going to be out soon and its not make sure you are 100 sure before promising that we waited another 10 mins and finally our food was out now getting to the food  overall the food was okay i got the fish tacosmahi mahi and shrimp taco my husband got a soup in a bread bowl the mahi mahi taco was delicious the shrimp taco was a little lacking in flavor what i really disliked about my order was the salsa and guacamolenot sure what it was but it looked like a sad attempt at guac the guac had a weird consistency almost like tooth paste i didnt even want to try it the salsa was okay my husband enjoyed his soup and bread bowl but we both agreed it probably wouldnt be a place we would be back to anytime sooni wanted to like this place  i really did  i understand what previous reviewers said about stake bagels  my opinion is that they may just be different than most are used to  either way i did end up throwing the top half away  everything else was fine but there werent tons of people there either just wad quite disappointed with the bagel itselfthe food is not really authentically mexican i liked the cute idea of the little doll to put under your pillow to scare bad dreams away not sure it is related to the mexican culture though i was hoping for something truly mexican the service was just ok not too knowledgeable about their food itemsservice was slow food was nothing to write home about and our server forgot our drinks several times i would say skip this place and go to another restaurantthe food was good but that was the only thing that was long lines sullen service one of the counter people just seemed to wander off one funny thingthe counter person made a big deal of using her safe serve wrappers to grab a bagel just as the grumpy old guy who calls you for your order showed up with two completely unprotected fists full of bagels well funny but also grossservice was great and egg platter was good but french toast was absolutely terrible  it was so tough you would barely cut it with a knife  i have never seen anything like it there was a small amount of egg on the very surface of bread they called it french toast but it was notcalled for a togo order 72 put on hold for 15min gave up went elsewhere  called for a togo order 717 put on hold for 7min gave up went elsewhere  it sucks because the food is awesome but please step up the customerservicethey are just pancakesnothing more nothing lessfor a truly great breakfast hit up the copper kettles sunday brunchbreakfast food is hard to mess up but somehow everything was pretty blas oh except the ice coffee that was terrible  we got waffles and french toast and other breakfast sides hash browns tasted frozen eggs were just ok waffles were flavorlessi was so disappointed by this place   normally i find places near the water to have fresh albeit simple delicious seafood unfortunately it was not the case at this shanty by the sea  the prices were super inflated and not all of their seafood was fresh which should have been the first major indicator that our group should dine elsewhere  i ordered the crab cakes which arrived lukewarm and greasy overall not very appetizing   i think next time i will skip the pier and go straight for a fresh clambakethis taco bell location is one of those kfctaco bell combined restaurantstwo menus in one restaurant  the taco bell doesnt even show up on the taco bell restaurant locatori checked their website afterward  i wanted a chalupa and a diet coke  and a bean burrito  and a taco  i was desperate yet this is a very iffy neighborhood even in the daytime  my lillywhite ass had a rental car so i looked around as i pulled into the drivethru  seriously just after i placed my order in the call box a tricked out monte carlo with spinners blasting gunit pulled up behind me with four thugs and a shawty laughing and shaking their car  and the hoopty in front of me was bumping lil wayne  aw damn  i figured the bullets wouldnt start flying until we all got fed so i was safe for a few minutes  typical taco bell foodwarm greasy and yummyexcept they forgot my bean burritobitches  would i go back  oh hell noi decided to give amfm a shot today after seeing the rave reviews it has been receiving on yelp to keep things concise i wasnt wowed i had the smoked turkey sandwich and pasta salad while it was a nice break from the pricier less healthy fares of the market i found the food to be bland perhaps it was my selection ill give it a shot again in the future but as of right now im not too impressedthe food  fantastic cant knock their burgers or fries the topping selection the taste or quality everything else ive stopped going here the people who work there are rude indifferent and sullen ive had experienced where ive waited several minutes at the register for the cashiers to stop texting or checking facebook before they ask me for my order it takes forever to make your food the quantity does not match the price i swear every order of fries gets smaller and smaller with the hundreds of other places dozens of them within blocks of here to get an equally or arguably better burger for less faster and with better service the only reason to eat here is if you have no other optionsfriendly service  ice cream was very good but overpriced or way too skimpy in terms of portion sizes  i would not return or recommend it others however if price or portion size isnt important than enjoy what you do getthis place was slow and didnt have any deals but the 599 6in meal deal considering the time of night and lack of customers you would think that they moved a little faster actually ended up leaving so i didnt try their foodmaybe this place is still new i dont know ill give it a few months and go back to see i got a burrito bowl gave me one scoop of rice  and one scoop of everything  i know i can ask more but man im not about to say it for everything i expect a little more when im paying 9   ill  just have to drive over to the one in voorhess cause i love chipotle   they know whats up lolall i wanted was some dessert thats it i mean you try resisting the words cheesecake scoops paired with the beautiful dessert display here especially when youre waiting for several hours for your flight  it unfortunately took me a looooooong time to get that cup of sugary goodness despite the name copelands cheesecake scoops doesnt just offer dessert  and there were some serious problems in their kitchen when i stopped by i distinctly heard the staffers complaining that someone had just walked off before i arrived whether they walked off for a break or left for good i dont know i just know that the people left working were left at a loss and the line of customers came to a standstill  eventually i think it was at least 10 minutes later the line got moving again and we all managed to get our food and hey the bowl of fruityandcakey goodness i got was certainly lovely hence my giving this place two stars instead of one   but if i were traveling through this airport again i doubt id give this particular business another chance the staffers were clearly not communicating amongst themselves let alone with the guests and no effort was made to keep us posted on what was happening or how long it would be before food came out of their kitchen   hopefully for my fellow travelers sakes they can find a better balance between good food and good customer service in the futureusually i have no problems at remedy however when i went with a girlfriend last week i was unimpressed the hummus wasnt the same the pita was hard and my chai latte was more foam than chai there were flys buzzing around while we ate seemed inconsistentgot around to checking this place out last weekend  i agree with one persons comment about its nothing like satco  thank god  im not sure why another person said it was  and another thing the college kidsfrat boys have found it but hopefully they wont make it one of their new hang outs as i didnt see buckets of beer on the menu   so the line issue will hopefully figure itself out because i dont think its a great idea  it takes people forever to order so the line doesnt move very quickly though maybe thats just how it was the night i was there and since its a new place people are unfamiliar with the menu and take longer but if there are open seats at the bar id run over there and grab them and you dont have to wait in line  you can place your order at the bar although then you have to eat indoors   the staff seemed very friendly and eager to serve which was a good thing the menu was small and simple which is also nice sometimes  too many options can make choosing difficult  they have about 8 different soft tacos and i think also about 6 different enchiladas  all the tacos are 250  they also serve up some sides like salsas queso and guac  all for a good price of less than 4  i think they also had some other items but since i was there for tacos i didnt really read them  the southern fried taco wasnt too exciting  just some fried chicken and a sweet sauce in a taco  so id pass on that one  the korean bbq one i thought was really tasty  great flavor to it  my boyfriend had the fish taco  he said it was good but not great  and he also had the spicy shrimp taco which he said was excellent and now wants to keep going back just for that taco  apparently its super super spicy so beware i liked the queso i didnt think it resembled gross melted down cheese like someone else mentioned  it was creamy and tasty  served its purpose they also had an interesting drink menu  im gonna try the lojito next time i go  which was basically a mojito that uses a local rum in it   so all in all  i thought it was a great place  its super affordable it can be quick if your timing is right and they had some really interesting fun flavors instead of your standard boring tacos  i mean kelly p if you want boring standard tacos  then go to satco or las palmas or whatever mexican restaurant youre used to going to  this place is for interesting flavors proper portion sizes good prices and quality food    oh and they valet park  which i hate using but its convenient when theres no parking spaces   update   so i went back to local taco last weekend and decided to remove a star from my review  first of all  the music they were playing was very loud  now  loud music doesnt necessarily upset me but i had to yell across the table to speak to my boyfriend during the meal  yell  not only that   but the music they wanted to blast was maroon 5  what and not just a song  but the whole album  i hate that band  so it totally ruined my whole experience in there  why on earth would you play an entire album at a restaurant  there is a reason for the radio or mixes so your music can appeal to the masses not single them out  jesus  it was terrible ok so on top of the awful loud music  there were flies buzzing around us the whole time and we were eating inside due to the intense heat outside  they were swarming our table  very unpleasant experience to top it off  about 2 hours later both of us were experiencing sour stomachs    this really upsets me because i really really wanted to like this place but after this last visit i dont think i want to returnthis place is conveniently located adjacent to genos steaks when the weather is subzero go here get a coffee and eat your steak in warmthusually packed line moves slow i notice the employees dont really care about what they are doing they rush making the food trying to just get the line to move without caring small portions for what they charge have been to many chipotle restaurants and this one gives the least amount of food not good for returning customers will not be backthis place is dirty and old if you go to the drive thru youll get better service than if you go inside lunch time is the worst its like the found the slowest people to ring during the busiest timei dont understand why people go to moes ive been to two different locations and the food is just disappointingvery bland the pico at this particular location looked like it was a few days old luckily the salsa bar made up for it queso was good but i just think there are better optionsi wont be back burger patties lacked in flavor cajun fries were under cooked  staff was real nicei dont drink so my review is really only for the restaurant portion of the brewery  sadly this place turned out to be another chapter in the long tale of ordering a burger to be cooked medium and getting something back that is well done and decidedly not medium  this one was a bison burger which i was excited about but fairly disappointed with due to the chernobyl grilling  i didnt feel like sending it back but come on people medium  pink in the center  look it up  seriously  oh and they have no fries or chips  really am i being too traditional in expecting this  they brought me out mashed potatoes in lieu of the coleslaw i avoid mayo based dishes in principle and the mashed were pretty good but not what i wanted with a burger  finally to cap it off we had their sticky toffee bread pudding dessert  it was good but whoa two bites of that and you should really call it quits  way too rich for my bloodwow the bread was awesome but the service and food was less desirable the bartenders were a bit more concerned about doing shots with each other than taking care of the paying the salad i ordered was full of store bought croutons  actually contained the root of the romaine interestingthis was my first time at panda express i found the workers there to be very pushy trying to hurry me through the line   lets get down to brass tax nuts and bolts this is a buffet without the benefits of a buffet some jabroni scoops out your portions and you cant go back up to feed your fat gob   the orange chicken and kung pow chicken left me unsatisfied it was cold and served on a paper plate ew   also they charge 1 dollar for an extra fortune cookie thats right 1 dollar for a fortune cookie greedyweaselsill start by saying i cannot speak on the food because we did not stay to eat my cocktail was very good as was the bartender i was rather appalled by the fact that after we took a seat and ordered our drinks the hostessmanager came and told us we would be charged 500 each bc they had a jazz band that night which is odd bc it was more of a restaurant than a venue i couldnt imagine them doing that i mean a house band should be an incentive to eat there not a hinderance seemed like a desperate attempt to make money the decor was lackluster and minimal a huge black wall seemed unfinished the bar looked under stocked ikea bought and like it belonged in a basement hopefully they can turn these things around if not i dont see them making itfood c beer b atmosphere c service b  went to urban village per request from a member of my group of friends to check it out after a month of their opening it is pretty clear that they are still getting over a learning curve we were seated outside and our waiter while very polite was overall not attentive and not knowledgeable of the menu he was helpful with the beer selection though so a plus there in addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset you cant see anyone aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night great bathrooms though very clean  we all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out out of 7 pies that we ordered i really only liked 1 maybe two of them and even so they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them for the price tag of around 1214 a pie that was really disappointing maybe the other food is better but i cannot comment on that and only through my experience  the beer itself was good but ive had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well most of the beers are pretty entrylevel if you are a craft beer lover so nothing exciting  overall it was nice to try out the place i dont go to nolibs often so it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood but i dont think i will be returning for the food maybe for 12 beers if i am getting ready to go out somewhere however if it is too crowded i will be looking elsewhere as it is not worth any waithad dinner here on a recent friday evening  glad we had reservations for 5 as they were packed tight have learned this is to be expected in a new tampa restaurant excellent and very attentive service could not make up for the soso food    we ordered several appetizers to share  queso fundito and flautas de pollo  queso was tasty but nearly impossible to tackle and remove to a chip once the skillet dish cooled off  2 flautas for 8 served on a large plate fancy dressed but not impressive for taste  i had carne asada iron skillet tacos served with mini corn tortillas which were so soft they fell apart when i tried to load them  finally went to the beef  with a knife and fork as it was quite tough and lacked any real flavor  the accompanying sauces were quite good  for me the best by far was the delightful passion fruit tea  served in a tequila bottle  besito is high on atmosphere gimmick and price  maybe tampa will support this location past the newrestaurantfrenzy phase  for the price there are too many other local options for me to hurry back herethe food is pretty low quality its almost always dead and the only reason we go there is for byoing   definitely a place to steer clear of if you are looking for real indian foodthe venue is fantastic a beautiful remodeling of a classic building in an easily accessible part of town  pork tacos were acceptable but the small portions and over priced nature lost them points  stuffed poblano peppers were undercooked and had meager stuffing  the beer leaves a lot to be desired and is exceedingly overpriced especially if you want to fill a growler   good effort in architecture but we wont be backdont like being a hater but 1st knock on it  was that it took an hour to get my food then it wasnt that good either kind of bland  the people are nice and the restaurant looks nice too but doubtful if im coming back the curry was blehme hi which of your smoothies are made with fresh fruit woman behind counter oh the pineapple and peach me great i love fresh pineapple woman well its canned fresh fruit me      thinking what are your other fruit flavors made from if not canned fruit   our bubble tea i ordered almond milk tea with boba comes out and the almond flavor is waaaay too strong  i end up throwing it away  fox news is playing loudly on the tv in the corner  i was really excited about this place because im a bubble tea addict and the new location is close to my house visions of nightly mango milk teas danced in my headonly to be dashed    bings id love it if you could have real fruit in your smoothies and lets try some music instead of fox news  make some changes and id love to try again  response to the comment below its great to know there is real even if canned fruit in other smoothiesid love to know which ones because all i had to go off of was what the woman behind the counter told me and those were the only two she mentioned  its too bad the owner asked me not to try again instead of clarifying because i love to give places another try and update reviewsguess ill just keep dreaming of joy yees coming to tucsona clean little place w average food friendly service but this place does not deserve all the hype and 45 star ratings clean and simple but nothing more dont walk more than a block for thismediocre at best the decor is very nice and i like what the restaurant is trying to do with healthy food options but the service is poor my mother and i waited over an hour to get our entrees and our server never apologized for the wait or came to check to see if we needed anything i ordered the big easy benedict which was supposed to have chorizo sausage and i literally had maybe 5 small slices of chorizo and the rest of my dish were the eggs and vegetables definitely not worth the money i will give one star for the decor and one star for the manager who did stop by our table to take our drink and food orders when our waitress disappeared and did try to keep an eye on us from time to time their servers definitely need some training as well two of the people who brought food to our table did not know what dishes they were serving us and said the wrong names when they served our fooddrinks i dont see any reason to go back herehad lunch there staff were a delight food over priced hate the bag thing i like plates eating in just go to wendys or dennys dennys has a double cheeseburger thats really good and its served on a platei took my wife and two boys to phat bites for an early dinner on a tuesday  weve been to ellendales and the old phat bites location numerous times but this was our first trip to the new location  the space is cool and the bar is a nice addition  food was good as usual but our experience ordering our meal was absolutely miserable  not sure i can capture how bad the exchange was in this review but it ended with my wife feeling confused and uncomfortable and myself literally asking the employee how difficult can this be  that employee took what should have been a 4 star experience and made it a 2 star experience  the employee was quizzing us on the menu not providing any answers and not being helpful in the least  so i checked yelp and it appears others have had similar experiences  phat bites should be a 4 to 5 star restaurant on yelp  it is 35 largely because of bad service  tighten it up pbthey are kind of skimpy on their ingredients for the price youre paying the chicken in my jerk chicken taco was undercooked as welli was excited when this chipotle was first open since its our favorite fast food ever but were greatly disappointed my pet peeve with chipotle is when they undercook the rice and this chipotle location really never disappoints when it comes to undercooking their rice they dont know how to cook their rice we gave them several chances and kept coming back hoping it was just a flux but it was not we just ordered 3 bowls and the rice is completely hard and undercooked even my 4yo daughter said its so crunchy its like eating seeds that is what broke the camels back we are not going back to this chipotle unless you enjoy eating raw hard rice i suggest you dont come here either i am asian and i eat rice 3 meals a day so i know my ricethe selection here is not great and neither are the prices the number of groceries and markets in the neighborhood is limited so this place unfortunately the only place to get certain items in the immediate area   the maxxs is the best market overall in the area and food  friends has an okay selection despite their high prices rittenhouse market is the only place in the area where you can get some items  for example unless you want to walk to trader joes or rely only upon deli meats and sausage rittenhouse is the only place in the area to get meat and fish the meat isnt great the fish is okaygood and at least its not badly priced  considering that there are other places are easily within walking distance only of the only advantages of rittenhouse is its size its the largest supermarket in the area and so can provide a one stop shop for food and house hold items   that said theres a hardware store just around the corner maxxs and trader joes within walking distance and a smattering of other shops slightly further away not to mention reading terminal market which is a 12 minute walk from herevegetarian hoagie was not impressive but was a bit soggy with an ungenerous amount if wilted lettuce and tomatoes the person taking my order did not listen to me and wrote down the wrong address and rudely hung up on me because of the incorrect address it took the delivery person though nice took awhile to get my food delivered since they went to the wrong locationi was not impressed  too me it was more like a preppy local market for the wannabe italians  my family lives an hour or so north from there so they figured it would be a treat nah  the prices on a lot of the items were an arm and a leg i told my folks listen you want the stuff ill ship it to you  oh and by the way i was checking out some items in one the of the isles as i walked passed this women i had said mi scusi to be polite it means excuse me in italian what the hell i figured i was in a supposedly in an italian market wanted to bring some italia to the place  she mutters under her breath asshole    i just wanted to add one thing to this review  the women in question was what you call an arrogant snob and i politely said to her and i quote its a shame that we as americans treat one another in such a way she blushed and turned away  this ones for you georgia peach spent time there while keeping aholes like you free i fly down there on a charter not like regular bozos like you  my brother picks me up on the tarmac in tampa airport he has a limo business in fla nice to have   i will be sure to review a local place maybe we can catch up  ciaowhat happens when you you put a faux country gift shoprestaurant near a busy highway and  you add rocking chairs on the front porch  you get mediocre comfort food and service in a large noisy room with a less than clean floor  surprising thing is i have never been to one that wasnt crowded  go figure  this one in white house was no exception  so why did i go  it was conveniently located and i was hungrynot a fan service was decent but the food was not hot and did not taste good my husband and i have not been back sinceso we ended up here because not your average joes had an hour wait on a wednesday night i am not a big fan of mexican food but my husband loves it we were immediately seated and the restaurant has a nice decor albeit very loud half the space was emptymy husband ordered a cabernet sauvignon and i had white sangria the cabernet was a cheap brand and my husband said it was too sweet nothing interesting about the sangria i started noticing an abundance of flies as we sat there not just the common houseflies but a lot of gnats or fruit flies and it was really annoyingi ordered the southwest chicken wings they were supposed to be in a mild sauce but i found it quite spicy my entree was the kale salad and my husband had the fish tacos tacos were bad the fish was tough and dry as were the accompanying black beans and rice the kale salad was a huge plate of mostly kale with barely any tomato or guacamole it was a bit overbearing even though i enjoy kale some manager came over to ask if we mind if they opened the huge open air window on the side of the restaurant where we were sitting and i mentioned to him about the fly problem in fact some had gotten in my husbands wine glass the manager said it was because they had the window open earlier and comped the drinks which we appreciated the service was fine but the food leaves a lot to be desired do not recommendthis is a little bagel and sandwich shop tucked away in a small plaza that is in the middle of a residential neighbor  we only stopped by for breakfast not lunch  the service was finefriendly and the place appeared to be clean  there is parking in the plazas private lot and when we stopped by at 830 am there wasnt a crowd or wait  we both ordered the same thing which was a bagel with lox cream cheese capers and onions  no drinks as we both had water in the car  we did decide to eat there since bagels and lox can get messy    the bagel and lox i found to be average definitely nothing special and seemed to be heavy on the cream cheese and light on the lox  my husband said he found the bagel and lox not to be rememberable  the bagel itself was touted as being a new york style bagel as per the sign on the window other store info  i really think that they meant york city pa style bagel    what really got me though was each not both bagel and lox was 1075 and our total bill for just two bagels and lox with tax just shy of 23  and that did not include any drinks etc   based on the price along i would not return but the listless bagel was pretty bad toovery nice lady took my order i stuck to my go to meal which is crispy cashew chicken which was a decent size but super expensive  the cashew chicken was just ok at best they did not make this as a combo order so i also ordered a side of egg roll these were horrible my husband had the pork fried rice which was decent  he also ate their crab rangoon that was extremely sweet my husband also got a small order of egg drop soup which was fine i dont think this is too much food yet it cost 25 way too expensive for so so foodevery single time that ive gone here it always tastes like they have a little bit of cleaning supplies on the food the bread always taste like its laid on the surface that has just been cleaned too clean it always grosses me out and i usually just end up throwing my food away or just getting my money back i definitely just wont be coming here anymore its not worth it its a waste of moneyafter all the great reviews i looked forward to trying smileys the staff was friendly and polite i had the falafel pita the sandwich was hot but the seasoning was not as good as many others i have had in the philadelphia area i was dissapointedwe went to baileys range for the first time this last wednesday  the restaurant has a decent atmosphere the ceiling has old stuff hanging from it with a modern architectural flare going upstairs i noticed the steps were caked in old compact dirt and grime it reminded me of a set of dorm stairs its a pretty old building but they could have refinished it better  the bathroom upstairs was in decent condition but they hadnt dusted in some time and there was quite a bit of dust caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc  we sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street decent view  we started off the meal with a pitcher of their boozy lemonade for 30 something dollars i can guarantee there wasnt much boozy in it tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it  on to the food  it took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full  the burger meat had flavor but was dry for 11 for the burger alone i would expect better  the chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions  overall a meh experience i wont go back and wont recommend the place to anyone else   in my opinion they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesnt live up to the expectationim from new york city so im used to omelets and oatmeal for breakfast and thats not an easy thing to find in new orleans i cant even fathom eating fish for breakfast i found cafe fleur de lis and saw that it had a normal menu so i figured id try it out  i called to find out if the oatmeal was made with milk or water and the person who answered the phone had no idea and was completely thrown for a loop when i got there i asked if i could get the farmers omelet with egg whites and my waitress had no idea it turns out you can my omelet wasnt bad but wasnt amazing  the person i was dining with ordered the pancakes and you have a choice of a few things that you can get with them so he chose bananas again the server had no idea what he was talking about when he ordered the pancakes with bananas then when they came to the table she held them up and examined the plate because she thought that they had made them and forgotten the bananas they didnt also the pancakes were alright not great  i wouldnt go back here if youre in the area go to the camellia grill down the street its so much betterso im curious how hard it is to work at a taco shop ive worked in a pizza joint been a sandwich artist and have sling many a beer in my day but never have i encountered the snail like pace of the taco shop employees i walk in and wait the first five minutes for the counter person to finish his personal phone call i know it to be personal when he says oh i gotta go there are like people here then begins to take our order he finds out were trying to dine in and refers us to a table  sitting at said table for 10 min or so and we wonder where the people we saw behind the counter ran off to surely someone will bring menus or something soon  wait more ok now im really hungry and we go back to the counter to just get food to go and eat in the car  tasty tacos but not worth the wait or confusion that they requirelet me say that i dont live in missouri and my state banned indoor smoking a long time ago  i went to hot shots with friends the menu had a variety of options  mostly it was basic sports bar food  i forgot missouri allows indoor smoking the place smelled like an ash tray and you left smelling like one too  service was ok you could almost predict when the waitress would return about every 5 minutes  plenty of tv screens to watch sports over all not stellar nor goodvery slow if you on your lunch brake you might have to consider to go someplace elsei think i was expecting something a little more upscale at dinardos but it didnt really hold up  the place was too bright for a good date night spot and the decorations including the placemats were hokey  the food was all right the wait staff was fantastic the sole reason to go is the staff honestly their platters come with insanely salty fries and a few strings of green  clams casino were all right but each clam was small so you dont get a nice flavor  i was disappointed  in short this place is not terrible but i wont be going back any time soonoh my goodness you are a coffee and donut shop why am i waiting ten minutes in the drivethru  horrible service we need more dd franchises so this one is not the only optionmy husband and i frequented ndulge cupcake boutique at there state college location the year we graduated ndulge closed its doors and relocated to the philadelphia area upon moving to the area we were excited to come across the business and decided to take a visit we were completely disappointed the two female staff that were present were unfriendly and had awkward attitudes which created an extremely uncomfortable environment one of the female staff did not even address me in conversation and was only speaking to and making eye contact with my husband  the case had a very small selection of cupcakes that didnt look appealing in terms of display or design they were sparsely frosted with no special garnishes we bought four different kinds and they all lacked some sort of quality component the only thing pistachio about the chocolate moussetachio was the pistachio on top of the cupcake the other cupcakes were extremely dry and dense and either had sparse filling or were over filled to the point where we had to scoop dollops of filling out the term boutique implies sophistication and specialty the cupcakes here are far from being boutique quality and arent anything specialsave your time and your money and seek out another cupcake shopservice is ok cooler and dining on your beignets inside isnt the same but on a hot and humid night you can appreciate the blasting ac in morning call  cash parking lot little wait time  prices have gone up but who is gonna complain when its still pretty cheap beignets here are lighter and come plain so that you can toss your own confectioner sugar on it  overall if you want the tourist experience head down the french quarters and put your elbows on the sticky tables down therei dont understand why this place has a line out the door wrapped around the block every day  the food is ok but its not worth the wait  i make better pancakes at home just saying  lolomg  the prices on this utterly mediocre and im being generous on that food are ridiculous  17 for a kale salad with 5 over cooked shrimp  seriously  16 dollar burger no fries and a 3 up charge for a side salad  if the food was amazing id gladly pay these prices but no way for what we got pizza had virtually no sauce and was tasteless  skip this place and go to salt rock insteadyummy fried rice thats what i thought when going to panda my favorite thing there is the rice i forgot panda has changed there rice recipe it is not the same any more in my opinion its worst the the other way they make it   this facility is located in a great area theres tons of shopping around and lots to do as for the inside of the facility it was the same as most other chains when walking in the tables were messy and the line was very long we waited for about 20 to 25 minutes now i think this has something to do with the food place next to it the reason why i said that is because we went there first and they ran out of a main ingredient  which means better business for panda   as for the staff they seemed to be dreading the day they stuck with the bare minimum of talking with customers what can i get for you  but then shortly after the staff started talking about personal stuff i front of customers now if that was me i would prefer my personal life be private especially infringe of strangers   as for going back i may go back when thinking of the fried rice and forget they changed the recipewhere should i start the menu is very condense the atmosphere is very loud and noisy they have a great system but they need to turn it down a notch service was not that friendly food was ok nothing special typical bar food  definitively would not go backi honestly loved my fajita platters both times ive come here but the rest of the food was meh and the service is the absolute worst like it literally makes me want to tear my hair out its so bad the first time we waited over an hour for our food never mind that the restaurant was just about empty the second time i came with my parents and they were miserable because despite the fact that the restaurant was againempty we waited 20 minutes for a table then once seated my mom had to literally stand up to flag someone down that someone happened to be a manager who had to take our order because our waitress didnt decide to show up until we had been sitting there for 30 minutes then once the manager took our drinks order it took 20 minutes for it to come finally an hour and 10 minutes later our food showed up my brothers burrito was scarfed down in about 4 minutes and he was left hungry and unsatisfied at the quality of it i loved my fajita platter but felt bad for everybody else seriously mad mex needs to figure their service issues out or close down bc coming here isnt worth your sanity or frustrationdecent food nice atmosphere lots of brightly colored fake parrots come willing too wait because youre gonnapizza was really bland didnt taste like much at all also the order was delivered 30 min latehubby and i ate here before years ago and was really impressed by the large portions and good food unfortunately we recently visited because of our prior visit and it wasnt the same first off the bloody mary my husband ordered was watered down and not flavorful you tasted the ice and tobassco more than anything the clam chowder was great that was only saving grace the lobster roll was nit what we expected becuae it was mostly filler than lobster not the big chunks of lobster and buttered roll youd expect especially for 18 my meal was consisted of fried oysters shrimp calamari and scallops but it was super scarce and not bountiful as before where i had leftovers we definitely should have ordered a whole lobster or crab special to share than what we ordered its always full and people love the view as we did but this time we were sorely disappointedyikes what a disappointment     went to this restaurant knowing in the past that they took great care of us on special occaisions it was my hiusbands 60 th bday     i called the manager ahead of time  days and let him know the situation  i requested a special room he told me there were other requests for the room  i was fine with that  i made arrangements to come meet with him to make the evening special for my husbands 60 th bday and he was very dismissive and treated me terribly  when we were there he never once came and acknocladged our presence at the restaurant   someone at the table was dissatisfied with their meal and it went on deaf ears no dissappointed in john and his behavior  we will never go to this restaurant againi love bareburger and have dined at many bareburger locations in nyc but this one is by far the worst i have eaten here twice both times i was seated and then had to wait 15 minutes for a server to even approach my table the food takes very long to come out and i had to find somebody to ask for the check since my server never checked in with us strange too since its a relatively small location a very frustrating experiencethe owner is what makes this place shine  she is incredibly nice the shop is well put together cozy the intelligentsia coffee should be a reason to go here  but i digress  after the owner hired more staff as it was impossible to work all the time herself the coffee suffered  its heavily watered down  this speaks of one of two things improperly trained staff to lack of concern for the final product  i thought it was just me at first so i had my parents taste some nope the comment was this is worse than folgers  please fix the brewing method  i was a regular here since they opened but i drink coffee not fancy drinks not sugar infused lattes  ive been with the owners of philadelphias best roasters one village square one reanimator etc im not some dunkin donuts fan complaining about what i think coffee should taste like  ji found spoon me just a few weeks ago and initially i liked it a lot  there were a number of great flavors and they had my favorite topping that none of the other fro yo places havewet walnuts  that and some strawberries  i was in heaven   i went back today alone for a treat it was about noon and the place was empty  i decided to try a waffle lined cup and then added yogurt there were only a few flavors this time but i put in cookies  cream and then i went to toppings  i put a scoop of strawberries in and cos of the waffle cone i needed to push them in a bit  well the guy there gasped grabbed the scoop from me and ran to wash it  i didnt realize what i did  and he obviously didnt learn that you never make a guest feel bad in your place   i will not be back   ill try to convince yogo in westmont to add wet walnutsget your wallet out here grouper and shrimp was pretty good quality   smoked fish was poor at best  wouldnt buy from here  again better quality at the flea market for half the price  wed and sat try the wagon wheel i think the pink shimp and grouper was better and fresher there cleaned while you waitthis place wasnt bad but its not my kind if mexicantex mex they serve the americanized mexican food covered in queso and weird sauces i prefer to add my own salsa so its not drowning in sauce ultimately making my taco soggy its not their fault a lot of people like it that way im still on the hunt for my kind of mexican but i will say the service was outstandingwas there last night and the drinks were very small for the price nice decor but over priced menus for mexican  i think i will stay at miguelswhat happened here i used to love this pizza i thought it was the best in town it was my default   the last 3 pizzas ive purchased have been awful granted i get the personal size but still  gummy crust sparse toppings i used to eat this one pretty regularly and it does seem to be noticeably different   four stars to the antipasta antipasto salad the red wine vinegar dressing is still delicious and the salad is fresh and tastywf has healthy foodsbut it isnt any different most of the time from a hospital cafeteria pink or overcooked chicken breast dirty salad bars i cant figure out why so many people flock to wf for prepared food this location has always had the better food  the new plymouth meeting location isnt badbut they pump out so much food with people that are busy and dont give a shit too much jenkintown wf prepared foods sucks never eat the proteinsif they are not dry they are undercooked pink and i have seen way too many employees eating over counters etc they consistently are inconsistenttons of under cooked vegetable like roasted beets that my gut hated me for being dumb enough to eat and not ask for my money back asparagus grilled and cutwith tons of woody stemsnot thick but completely inedibleout of a 10 salad almost half must have been shit   just get a shake or sushi and youre good to gonot a good stop if youre looking for baked goods or meats everything on the shelves is acceptable but theres nothing here that distinguishes this place at all and with a publix right across the street youre better off heading there  the deli has fried chicken and sides sitting under heat lamps for hours on end and none of it looks appealing the bakery doesnt make anything too distinctive or delicious i got the fresh garlic bread and the bread itself wasnt all that great but having it smothered and covered in what seemed like crisco with some dill and garlic in it didnt help just didnt work at all  the butcher shop has some decent prices but the cuts arent as good as some others ive seen i might have just hit them on bad days but the only decent product ive seen is behind the display window where you have to ask the guy to wrap it fresh for you and a lot of times the bargain prices force you to buy in pretty big quantities which is fine for big families but not necessarily for single people or couples   there are better options out there so id stay away unless there was some awesome bargain availablei will say this the place looks cute and is not a disaster like the previous place  ive been in twice and been disappointed both times  my last visit i ordered ahead for cupcakes for my daughters birthday  went in spoke with the owner and discussed what i wanted and a pick up time  they didnt have my order ready when they said they would  im pretty sure they took the day old cupcakes from the display and took the old frosting off and then frosted them while ill waited  then charged me 20 for 12 regular sized cupcakes  nothing fancy will not be back  plus all the tables were dirty and no one seemed to really be workingim a partner so i know the standards and im usually pretty understanding since i know what its like but the minute i walked into the store the girl on bar had an attitude with another customer the store wasnt busy and i was the only one waiting the barista at the register didnt acknowledge me i probably waited a good couple minutes before being greeted the guy didnt give me my discount after i told him i was a partner luckily i mobile ordered my other drinks even then i didnt even drink my caramel macchiato because it was grossive definitely had betterordered samosas and also the chicken tikka masalaboth were disappointingwont be eating from here againhonestly i dont know what all the hype is about i went with a friend for lunch and ordered the lobster tail special  there was so little meat and it was dry and rubbery i also ordered the lobster bisque which tasted like it came right out of a campbells creme of chicken soup can it was also not the greatest experience because 2 workers were arguing loudly at the front of the store maybe it was just a bad day but all i know is that i wont be going backvery friendly and accommodating staff  the crust has no flavor no crunch and is almost burnt on the bottom  in fact its burnt around the edges which leaves a charcoal taste in your mouth  the toppings are just okay and the spicy sauce is too spicy as its all you can taste on the pizza  this pizza has so little flavor other than the spicy sauce  i wanted to like this new plaze as the price is so affordable but ill just get a pizza at rouses across the streetcame here with my mom all of the employees looked very young it looked like a hang out spot they were just standing around talking to each other they got my moms order wrong and charged her for something she didnt get  the chicken sandwich i ordered looked like someone smashed my bun with their hand i never go to a fast food joint looking for 5 star food but atleast make the food look decent im never eating there again the building is so charming i really wanted to love this place  the food is meh  if you just want a beer in a charming atmosphere and dont care much about the food this is your placefinally dined in for the sushi buffet on tuesdays the first time i went it was ok service the waiter didnt fill up my water until i pointed it out however the second and most recent time i went i was sorely disappointed while the sushi buffet is still a good deal it honestly isnt worth me trekking out again the manager has since my last visit started enforcing a no sharing rule i inquired if we could just swap one sushi out with each other since we were both getting the sushi buffet the waiter resolutely said no  while he and the other waitress were polite enough when bringing our food and taking our orders i could do without the slow service we waited close to 30 minutes for our first set of rolls  and they chalked up the slowness due to needing to fry the tobiko there were maybe at most 4 other tables besides us there i could also overhear the waiter speaking in chinese that i was pushing and rushing for the food to be done i mentioned it once  well past the 25 minute mark sorry but frankly there shouldnt be a 30 minute wait for a single set of rolls i wouldve overlooked it but it happened consistently with each set of rolls that there was a long wait i would postulate that its a technique they use to discourage you from ordering more sushi regardless ive had better sushi buffets in the dc area for cheaper better service and better atmosphere in a city as large as philly im sure there are other sushi buffets to eat at while this was my go to for take out and sushi buffets previously i can safely say i am unlikely to return or order after my last trip other sushi buffets ive gone to dont require me to order off the menu and for me to finish each piece before getting more  and dont stipulate that i cant share among other people who have opted to get the sushi buffet tooif youre going to eat at an izakaya joint you should be a somewhat adventurous eater  that being said i found nothing adventurous about the menu at izayaka ren  i was so excited to hear that st louis was finally getting an izakaya restaurant  but after eating there last weekend im so disappointed  first off there are only about 4 different sakes on the menu  all those 30 bottles on the shelves in the bar  those are for display only we were told    the agedashi tofu was drowning in broth  i ordered agedashi tofu not agedashi tofu soup  the vegetable croquettes would be better as smaller silverdollar size bites  not pancake size  they were out of onigiri  which is just a rice ball grilled  so um why would a izakayasushi place be out of rice  we sat at the sushi bar and saw many rolls off to the side already premade  we imagine many of the cooked items we ordered we premade as well  as was probably the sold out onigiri  i imagine the raw scallops were wrapped in bacon and kept in the fridge days ago instead of being made fresh  the skewered scallops wrapped in bacon were fine  but anything wrapped in bacon is usually fine  with that in mind bacon wrapped mochi is divine and i highly suggest this restaurant start serving that  made fresh to order  the fried squid we ordered was tasty but really greasy  dont bother ordering the skewered quail eggs wrapped in prosciutto  theyre nothing to write home about  also we saw the cooks grilling chicken on a grill that had fishy mackerel grilling on it moments prior  ie that chickens going to taste awfully fishy  waitstaff needs help  first our waitress greeted us with do you want waters or sodas  not hello  not even may i get you something to drink  waitstaff also needs to stop entering for their shift through the front door  it doesnt look professional  they should arrive through the backdoor    my suggestions for the owners  polish up your staff create a more adventurous menu takoyaki would be a nice start have later hours offer a much much larger selection of sake lay off the tired sushi items and make things fresh to order  make it more of an izakaya sake bar with good food not some average west county sushi restaurant  my suggestions for potential patrons  expand your pallette beyond california rolls and tempura  also dont bother coming here until the owners change some things  also stop calling it tapas for christsakeim afraid that this place wont last long if management doesnt get their act together   the show and performers were ok but pretty much everything else was a disappointment  who runs out of jack daniels before the first show  i was surprised upon being told that we could only order food from the left side of the menu because it was the first night of the show that meant that our only choices were 1 pork steak or 2 a hamburger with chili a fried egg and hash browns all piled on the burger and the only side item was french fries the right side of the menu had a plethora of choices but was off limits  the burger was warm and might have simply been a unique gastronomic experience but it was burned on both sides and dry throughout the only part of it that i truly enjoyed was the krispy kreme donut that was used as the bun the fries meh  the pork steak was cold its not that it was barely warm it was cold as though it had sat in the hallway for a while before being brought out  the wait staff was pleasant and since we came for the show we didnt raise hell about the food just tried to have fun with the show  if you want a different entertainment experience it is certainly that but dont get your expectations too highjust tried the newly opened wheel cafe in dunedin let me start with the positives i liked the setup  decor i prefer a small menu which they deliver on better to do a few things well than a lot of things meh or bad it serves both breakfast  lunch  even though they were into their lunch menu they were willing to do breakfast for me the waitress was pleasant but the owner hoovered a bit too much i opted for a burger  a bowl of their soup of the day potato leek what i am about to say is meant for constructive purposes  not to be taken as digs if you are going to offer up trendy food you need to be better at seasoning your dishes  food temps the potato leek soup was bland  had no distinctive potato or leek flavor the burger ordred medium came out more rare than medium and also lacked favor chips on the side also lacked salt if you want to appeal to customers who can appreciate your menu please up your salt  pepper game and your cook tempsthis place is going down hill they serve salads and sandwiches from target and safeway  i can tell by the packaging and the sandwiches say archer farmstargets brand candy is overpriced and i doubt the chocolate is handmade  the froyo bar looks skeevy due to the fruit that looks a little past its prime  i do like the fact that the store is ur toppings bar for froyo and the 5 pound gummie bears are cool to look at but it has started to become kind of grossgreat location for anyone who works in the business district and wants some vietnamese for lunch however i ordered the pho here and really regretted it the broth was horrible all water and no flavor and they really skimped out on the portion of meat   being vietnamese i really should have known better and ordered something else but i just couldnt resist as i heard so much good things about this place from my american friends in short for all my vietnamese brothers and sisters out there do not order the pho as it is nowhere near on the level or standards were used too if you come here i recommend the bim bop curry or something on the vermicelli side as for pricing its a place in downtown so dont expect reasonable pricing were used to  however for all my american friends out therethis place is great di dont know why this place got high reviews  i ordered delivery based on those and i regretted it dearly  i ordered a standard dish chicken pad thai  i unfortunately couldnt even finish it  lacked flavor and was over spiced  there was something wrong with the sprouts they gave me they smelled like they were left in standing water for a long time   they actually made me gag both eating a few and just smelling them  i couldnt believe it    their fried rice and thai iced tea were good my gf said the rice was just ok and shes filipino  i am still just shocked at how inedible the pad thai was    i wont be going back  people get your reviews together  this is not a 5star place when a standard dish makes you gagi was so excited to eat here after seeing some yelp pics but i should have contained myself and went to samurai or virago instead the cucumber wrapped roll was decent bermuda roll was also mediocre the napoleon sashimi was literally off tasting  may get food poisoning later tonight not kidding worried at first the waitress was not apologetic  for the foul fish but eventually she came around with some free sake probably to help kill off deadly bacteria we just ate table also ordered a noodle and fried rice dish and really just found the flavors to be disappointing  thank goodness the bill was inexpensive but i will never step in here ever again worst sushi but probably shouldnt have chose that cuisine for tennessee ill stick to fried chicken and cheese grits for surethe food was ok the burrito bread was hard and wasnt fresh its like a fake chipotle lol but expensive should be cheaper thouprep and pastry is underwhelming if you want a hipster place to eat that offers a limited menu and subpar pastries then this is the place for you if you want enjoyable food and you want to wait less than 30 mins for a table go elsewherethe sandwiches tasted good but when trying to complete the kids meal for my 2 girls it was chaos first when i asked for the apples and milk the girl tried to charge me extra for them then after arguing with her she directed me to the refrigerator unit to help myself there was only one bag of apples and they were moldy it took over 5 minutes to get 2 fresh bags near the end of our meal my girls after drinking almost all of the milk said that it tasted funny i looked at the expiration day and it had expired two weeks prior i told the uninterested worker and we left thankfully my kids didnt get sick i wouldnt go back to that particular restaurant but i still like subwaygood service nice clean place and convenient parking thats it on the good points the food sounds asian looks asian but definitely does not taste like it the thai lime and chili had too much acidity and salt the chicken tasted fine if eaten alone with the rice but when eaten with the veggies it killed my taste buds and i couldnt finish also ordered the pei wei spicy steak with rice bland and too much peanuts doubt ill come here againburger was ok service was crap i will never give theses guys any more of my moneysowe visited gc for the first time on a rainy thursday evening  hubby and i really like beer but not all beer were not easy so we were looking forward to trying this place  it was packed we waited about 30 minutes for our tablenot bad  the place is new  our server was trying really hard a friendly guy he was very enthusiastic  he did forget to put in our food order but he came by and told us of his mistake and offered a free app   i had the northern lights lager  i really like lagers and wheat beers  im not an ale girl at all so i was pleased to see choices other than ales im looking at you boscos and cool springs brewery  my husband ordered the american wheat  they were both ok nothing special  i had the tomatobasil flatbread i wouldnt go back for that but ive had worse  overall we decided that we wouldnt break our necks to get back there but if we were with people who wanted to gowe wouldnt veto the choice either  not worth the a in aok for 3 stars  its a solid 25 ok  but since this is a new semester i cant go around handing out half stars willy nilly  well seewe gave this place a second try at the request of a family member   we went to dinner on a sunday night as  a party of 6 this time the appetizers were all in stock and the only thing they were out of was sweet potato fries  not a big deal   we ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great the only critique i had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses two meats and only five small pieces of bread we immediately asked for more bread but didnt receive it until our group had eaten 95 of the platter  i was again disappointed in the dinner of the 6 entrees on the menu four were seafood one was lamb and one was beef two of us ordered the exact same thing  the 6 ounce beef filet done medium one of us received medium while i received well done this is twice ive received well done when ordering medium   another member of our party ordered the depot burger and didnt receive it until 20 minutes after the rest of our food was brought out despite everyone ordering at the same time we made it known that it was unacceptable for him to have to sit there for twenty minutes while the rest of us had been served we were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived i dont know if this was an issue with the kitchen or with our order not being put in correctly but i will note that our server wrote nothing down   the only saving grace for this place is their bar with their refreshing and delicious cocktails everyone was pleased with their selections and multiple rounds were ordered i wish the dining experience lived up to the bar experience but i dont think we will be giving this place a third chancelong check outs  2 cashiers each with 4 customers got in line at 504 didnt get out tim 526  managers took people from one line to another register but not ours  1 customer had to do 3 separate order for her checks to work crazysub par sushi we ordered 2 rolls and the tuna tower all were pretty bad although the miso was pretty good yet the entire time i didnt even get a refill on my ice water which is pretty rough considering everything has spicy mayo  then we sat there for about fiveten minutes with the credit card sitting on the end of the table as a hint that we are ready for our bill but we still had to flag down someone elses waitress to get our bill we wont be going backlet me start this off by saying that ive been here in the past and had a very pleasant experience not this time though and ill come to why shortly  first of all it was probably slightly busier than normal due to the winter classic  okay i get that but this entire visit was completely fumbled by the staff here and i was ready to leave almost as soon as we sat down  no one came by to take our drink order we sat in the direct path of every server in the place the kitchen entrance was literally one table behind us so they constantly whizzed by us as breakneck speed yet waited over 10 minutes just for a coke and a beer sampler   for the appetizer we ordered the pale ale beer bread which came with a blue cheese cream cheese and bacon jam yum my only complaint is that the bread was totally soaked in grease the cream cheese kinda slid off but whatever i made it work   the beer sampler was great too we tried a variety of stouts ales and ciders my wife loved the double bean ale and their coffee stout is always on point for 5 small beers for 10 thats pretty much a steal  the food though  i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato wedges notice that i said wedges as in plural well i got five five wedges and one was so big i held it in my hand and pretended to be on buffy the vampire slayer  the sandwich was so cold i didnt even eat it and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun i took the sandwich home hoping to heat it up later  my wife got the apple and bacon pizza if you could call it that she asked for blue cheese on the side not knowing that it wouldnt come with cheese otherwise you know like a normal pizza and it didnt have some apple it had like a whole apple like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon it was sad and it made me sad   i got my coke refilled once and thats only because mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it i felt bad because it wasnt her table but our server was nowhere to be seen   my hopes were high but schlaflys dashed them i was planning on taking a dessert home too which makes me angriest of allwhat is the big deal with this place anyway people line up around the block and for what hype as far as i can tell there was absolutely not a damn thing special about my breakfast maybe a step up from ihop but not deserving of a long wait by any standard large portions sure but you can get that most anywhere in the south for breakfast i have nothing special to tell you about my meal or my friends meals which i tasted just standard breakfast fare and my breakfast potatoes are way better i dont know i would skip this place unless youre starving and there happens to not be a line that day id rather eat at noshville eveni took my family to the restaurant about 10 days ago  we arrived about 715 and were seated withing about 5 minutes 6 of us  we had a concert to be at by 930 so i thought we would have plenty of time    the waitress was somewhat attentive and got our appetizer down came in about 15 minutes and we ordered our burgers and waited about 3040 minutes for those to arrive  they were good burgers and unique sauces for the fries we shared    at about 825 we ordered 3 shakes 2 dishes of ice cream and one cone of the anticipated ice cream  at 900 we had not seen the waitress and the ice cream still had not shown  i saw the waitress and told her that it had bee 30 minutes and we needed to go so would she please cancel the ice cream and get my ticket  however she seemed to be trying to wait for our ice cream  at 905 she brought our ticket minus the ice cream  the ice cream arrived at the same time but we said we needed to go  they offered to put the shakes into a togo cup but did not show up  i paid the bill still tipped the slow server 20 because i am not sure whos fault it was  we left about 915    i emailed the manager and heard from him today and he has helped explain the actions taken that night and has generously asked to help get me back to try again  we will and hope to have a better experience  update   the manager said he would send me a gift card to help us come back to try again but he never sent  it i will not go out of my way to go back there are many other choices downtownissa no for me the dining room was cold the food was meh they pile it on here but ill take quality over quantity anyday the ice tea and lemonade were not homemade they tasted like the powdered kind you mix with water from the can  as much as i like to patronize black owned businesses i wouldnt recommend eating here  on the plus side our waitress tamika was oki had a cheeseburger and fries the burger wasnt seasoned and the fries were sooo salty wont be going back definitely have had better burgers elsewhere like axis pizza in uni cityi ordered 5 dozen cupcakes for my wedding two weeks before the big day i called the morning of my wedding and was told they were ready i picked up and only 3 dozen were made not happy considered yourself warnedmy husband and i had been looking forward to trying this place out by was quite underwhelmed with our experience   we got one of each of the fancy donut flavors which are currently chocolate old fashioned smores peanut butter malt key lime pie pineapple brown sugar and blueberry lemonade the first three on top were ok the last three on the bottom were not good at all the icing flavors just didnt mix well together with the actual donut for 2 per donut for donuts i was not impressed with at all i would not get donuts from here again save yourself some money and go to beilers for better donuts that are only 1 per the fact that the store is called federal donuts and only had six fancy donut flavors and three sprinkled sugar flavors was also far from impressive   i hear the fried chicken here is good so maybe one day well come back to check that out but definitely not the donutsi was pretty disappointed with our chinese new year dinner here  while the service was lovely and the dining room cozy the meal was underwhelming the description is pretty misleading this is not a 10 course meal but rather 10 bites if you will dishes were hit or miss the appetizers were the best  the peking duck roll was good as was the foie gras roll but the lobster dumpling was basically a dried husk the entrees were just okay  with the filet mignon and eggplant dish being the best cute dessert  the chocolate mochi cake was interesting i really did not think this meal was worth the priceim in side the hardrock standing at the noodle bar food is wonderful the problem is i am standing  again with the 6 other people waiting for one of the 16 seats they have for a very very popular restaurant although im sure the casino did not expect this place to be so popular it blows my mind that a company like this has not done anything to rectify this issue it is equally perplexing that i am standing on probably over 200 sq of tiled floor waiting for a seat how about putting some tables and chairs in this unutilzed space over the past year i have asked multiple floor managers about this but hear i am writing this review and still standing waiting for a seatthis is why millennials are broke 16 for a smoothie and its always so busy that you have to wait 25 minutes to even get your food id rather save my money and eat healthy at home a fun outing for a special treat but i dont know who in their right mind would be a regular herewow no surprise w all the negative reviews the staff here definitely needs better training we went for simple passport photo there wasnt any line but the girl briana was rude loud and seem piss about something lol when theres other customer inline she ask them what do you want lmao when our photo are ready she ask you guys ready lmao theres no crack of smile no thank you no have a good day hahha hoping for better training people herelast nights dinner was a profound disappointment    clearly they want you to buy fancy water or wine as the iced tea they served was a crappy mix  in a finedining establishment i expect to get my icedtea in a stemmed glass but i expect if im paying 3 for that glass that at least it should be made with a tea bag    i went with my mom and we both ordered salads  both salads had nice portions and fresh and flavorful ingredients    it all goes to heck at the entree  my companion had the duck  i had the striped bass  the menu is somewhat misleading  the duck was supposed to be served with herbed potato and orange braised endive  no potato grazed that plate and the duck was on top of what looked like soggy leeks  the brandycherry sauce was more like a savory jus with some cranberries    the bass was good but greasy  it was on top of what was supposed to be brussels sprout fondue  i wish they would have said that it was full of mushrooms and i would not have ordered it  there were more schrooms then sproutsbummer    we didnt trust them for dessert so we scooted out of there  the whole dinner took less then an hour  the bill was a few cents over 90    on a positive note the building and decor are lovely and romantic  despite the surroundings we wont be backi have to agree with the recent reviewer about the store condition and general customer service im visiting my son for a few weeks from another state and i am decidedly underwhelmed the few employees i encountered were helpful produce meat dairy but its hard to find one when you need one the store stock is minimal compared to what im used to but im told that the springfield store is newer and larger and better stocked  im also used to smiling employees who actually greet the customer first and ask if you are finding everything you need theres always help bagging and carrying bags to your car  had i not received the help i sought my rating would be one stargreat idea poorly executed   i stopped by to try some food unfortunately the lines were extremely long i was under the impression that i could just swing by and grab something quick for dinner i guess that everyone had the same idea  i hope that this happens again with a better system setup id really like to try some of the food that i wasnt able to enjoy over priced  two scallops 11 pizza burned on rim and soft undercooked in center  very small meal portions which are over priced never againas i mentioned the food is very good the service just keeps pissing me off i get pizza takeout quite often one time they told me they could only serve the restaurant customers as one of their ovens was broken i get things happens but their phone manners leave much to be desired they were quick enough to take my money but forgot to bring my pizza when i waited a sufficient amount of time they brought out someone elses before mine when i asked about mine the counter person told me it just came out of the oven when it comes out of the oven the box should be hot no it was barely warm doubt i will be back again even though it is convenient to my workreally sad moons opened a place on fairview service slow food was sad potatoes werent cooked barely any hollandaise on the cali bene eggs were hard to compensate for the partially raw barely warmed potatoes gave the server three chances to apologize or offer something for the returned half touched plate but got nothing will never be going back not how i recall moons downtown every beingi was attending snafu con and i was with one of the performers  this means that im responsible for making food runs  we decided to make a togo order of a chicken sandwich and two orders of fries  the phone ordering was awkward with an employee passing the phone to someone else then being told to ask for so so when i pick up the order umm what   when i pick up the food i had to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me at the togo counter not including so so being called to assist me  i noticed when she was putting the fries together she tried to tell me that the one tray was both fry orders ummm no   when the food was eaten the chicken sandwich was pale the bread was soggy with butterchicken was paleno hint of being grilled slathered with mayo limp lettuce unripe tomato this pathetic sandwich resulted in 10 floating in the toilet    grosscool little spot with a neat eclectic atmosphere sadly the coffee was not good i cant speak to any of the food or other coffee options i only drink regular drip coffeei wish this place was more awesome i love hanging on pardall the food was not the best in fact not very authentic either service was def not with a smile eitheri ate the eggs provencale their signature dish it was ok i dont believe that im a fan of thyme on eggs however the baguette was tasty i may come back to try something elseinconsistent location i find this location has its good days and its horrible days on this trip i didnt get any ice in any of my beverages and special orders  requests are completely ignored   i will say that the employee delivered everything with a smile it was just all wronga great place to stop by if youre about to buy beer next door  more popular with the locals due to its location if you want really nice desserts try isgros pastries if you want inspirational pizza try di bruno bros  the pizza tastes okay and the baked goods are soso  if you like really slowly and carefully made homestyle cookies this is your place but dont get your hopes up  something was very off about their alleged vietnamese ice coffee which actually made me physically ill after my first sip  maybe i am misinformed but i also thought nutella was recently classified as a neurotoxin in any case i wouldnt try their nutella cookies unless youre aware of the sideeffects  the parfaits are stingy on fruits and overpriced and a lot of other items seem to be asking for too much pricewise given the lowquality and small amount served  the mural on the outside is nice to look at and the whimsical nature of the inside makes it seem like its more than it really is  its just an industrial bake shoppe that puts out thoroughly average products  they do a lot inside the shoppe so many workers behind the cashier making things but usually have many things unavailable yet they have a wide selection of other things to get like hot pockets and ice cream sandwiches both of which are very unusual interpretations of the traditional items  thing is everything here tastes like imitation since the store is named after a pet cat i suppose being a copycat is part of the business model  great food to get for your kids in fact this place caters mostly to children      if you want to experience listening to probably the most annoying and redundant pandora stations feel free to stop in and bob your head to the old school jock jams otherwise bring ear plugs            all in all its kinda gross but you might be into that kind of thing  its philly after alli really wanted to like this place like really wanted to but after a few trips ive sadly come to realize that i dont love their donuts the flavors are great and very creative but theyre just too doughy and dense for me to be honest when i read reviews mentioning how light and airy these donuts are im a bit taken aback   maybe im missing the hype and have been heading in on bad days maybe they just make their donuts in a style that doesnt match my tastea mcdonalds seems so out of place here amogst the shishi shops on walnut street  that and it is a haven for local down  outs seeking a 1 mcchicken and a coke or coffee  i rarely ever set foot in here but admittedly i have once or twice  yickthe boneless pork chops with collard greens  were fantastic perfectly cooked pork beautiful sweet sauce paired with it and greens  the music was great  good jazz and blues which is what made the rest so disappointing the jambalaya and etoufe were mediocre the mojito was horrible as it was all sprite and  what little mint it had was brown  my bloody mary was too spicy and tasted of pure hot sauce  though i liked the music the 5 cover for it was off putting and added 20 to our bill that could have gone to food or drinks  the decor is sparse   all in all not thinking of going backfirst this review is for the market not the dining room and my order was to go  my advice is that if you love this place do not place a to go order here  ive been eating here pretty regularly and have never tried to order take out until my most recent visit  one of the people in the group needed to get home quickly but we had been planning on maynards and figured wed stick with it  i never considered that the market didnt do carryout and i certainly wasnt trying to be difficult it was my mistake and im not trying to be a jerk about asking for a service that isnt offered i really didnt know  i guess the market just seemed like a carryout friendly menu    anyway my issue is the way the lady behind the counter handled the situation   i could have handled a polite we dont do carryout   however she was really rude and clearly irritated  there was seriously no need for all of that  she went on about how the menu isnt intended for carryout and they dont have proper take out containers  ok i get that you dont do carryout  really ive brought home leftovers plenty of times in what i would consider to be very proper containers so its not necessary to make up reasons why youre annoyed that i asked for carryout just tell me that its not something you offer and ill come back next time i can dine in    the vibe in this place is usually so fun it was sad to be in there both ordering and listening to other people order she was pretty short with the guy who ordered after us too  he was dining in but had some questions about the menu possibly she was still irritated after my order    not a good experience  we love it here so im guessing well be back  but lesson learned dine in only  and if i see the same person behind the counter im heading across the street to congress which is where we ended up that afternoonpurchased a family size lasagna and it was super expensive it just tastes like regular lasagna wasnt anything fancy about it staff member was really nice thoughive gone here a few times and tried the regular and kobe beef burgers i would say its better than five guys or shake shack in terms of meat quality plus they have some interesting saucesif they actually give them to you  if you customize your own burger make sure you check that you got the toppings and sauce you wanted a couple of times i came home with my burger only to find that i was missing those key ingredients that make the burger at which point i was too lazy to put my pants back on and go outside leaving me no choice but to begrudgingly eat said burger sauceless   ive gotten a different person every time i ordered one thing they did have in common is that they had no idea what any of their own sauces or toppings were if the staff had a little training and cared about getting your order right this place would be great as it is i think ill save myself a dollar or two and go somewhere else for a quick bitethis is my fourth visit   its much improved from our first visit but still not yummy  the brisket while not petrified was still dry and chewy  im not sure whether the bun was stale or just not to my liking  it was kinda dry too but that might be the way its supposed to be  i liked the mashed potato side  fairly garlicky   coleslaw too saucy for me but not bad in general i love brisket on a bunbut here its passable  not something to make a point of coming out forvery disappointed spent 70 on tickets more on drinks and wasnt able to see the main show because i needed to put money in the meter so my car wasnt towed the concert was my birthday present and didnt even get to see them very bummed no where was is posted it was a closed event so had no idea the meter would be an issue just plain bummed about the nightwe went to maynards last night for the keeling schaffer wine tasting  we are actually members of the keeling schaffer wine club  we paid 1000 to taste 5 different wines and decided to sit out on the patio to enjoy the music with our wine  apparently we werent supposed to do that  the hostess came out and told that most tables were reserved and we should have checked in with her  sorry  didnt know that and it was actually surprising as the tables never did fill up  the wait staff proceeded to ignore us as we sat there  we are people that dine out on a regular basis and we know good customer service  maynards needs some help in that area  we finally were given menus but by that time maynards had gotten all of the money they were going to get from me  best part of the night was the keeling schaffer wine and pizza at empirewhen i was shown to my seat of was still wet so i had to use the napkin to finish the job place was full and service was poor i ordered the atlantic tuna melt  not convinced that the tuna was fresh and it was cold i ate half only  no one asked why  not the place if you are in a hurryi purchased eight different kinds of cupcakes for an office birthday party each one was so dry and crumbly i had to throw them away i was told the cupcakes were made the previous night at the same place i bought them i called and asked for the manager to issue me a refund of 30 i was told by the staff that the manager would contact me but i wasnt contacted  i will probably give them another try but i wont rely on them for something special like an office birthday party again i felt very embarrassed to be the one who provided the terrible birthday treatsyou know they say you only write a review when something goes wrong and they are correct in this case today 88  515pm i walked in to pick out several small bundt cakes leslie the person working seemed annoyed she did say try out vanilla cake today and pointed to the samples i knew what i wanted and walked straight to the display case no signs with prices so asked her the cost looking down at a computer she mumbles 499 and continues with typing i wait for her to look up and shes obviously busy and say im ready  she mumbles ohso youre ready now pretty distracted from her typing she stays looking down and points to the other computer to say will help you over there and points with her finger she mumbles the total i have to look at the register because i didnt hear her she seems annoyed and states the price again louder i pay she doesnt say anything she continues to look down and then walks away  she made it quite clear she was too busy for me there was one other customer but she was on the phone  leslie your customer service needs improving make eye contact with your customers and fake it if you hate working the closing shift  i really want to avoid you from here forwardalas another visit to our once most favorite donut shop was again a disappointment  apple fritters had only one or two small apple pieces in them  my chocolate iced donut tasted as if it was a day or two old but only recently frosted  it was the toughest yeast donut i can recall eating  ive had better donuts recently at quiktripeggs benedict had hard boiled eggs for both orders and smoked salmon was cooked on a grill ruining the texture and making for just a bizarre smoked salmon benedicti was very disappointed i called on thursday to inquire about picking up 2 boxes of buntinis on friday i was told that there are no more buntinis  they are only selling cakes or buntletts  i ordered a cake  when i went to pick it up i heard them say they have buntinis when it was my turn i explained what i was told the woman who was explaining it appeared to be in charge i asked her to at least talk to whoever made that error so that they might not disappoint another customer  she said she would but at no time did i feel that she was apologetic for their part of this misunderstanding  to top it off my red velvet cake was very dry not a big fan of this store right now  you all reached out to me on yelp after reading  this post if i could reply i would   in the meantime you have my info  you could reach out to me if you thought of rectifying thistoo expensive for the quality ordered lobster tail which was huge but overpriced drinks were watered down i would go elsewhere for seafoodate at vientiane for ucity restaurant week and was disappointed  the appetizers were good but the entrees pad thai and paneng curry were tasteless and boring the dessert i had cant remember what it was was absolutely disgusting  after reading all the positive yelp reviews we went back last night to give it a second chance thai iced teas were great the crispy pork spring rolls were delicious with a great pork flavor though the crispy spring rolls at vietnam cafe are similar and much better the grilled mixed vegetables with peanut sauce were bland but the peanut sauce was excellent i bet the chicken satay is good    we were really thinking that we were in for a good dinner until the entrees came not only did it take forever for our entrees to come but they were terrible we got the pad thai again to see if it would be better but it was exactly the same bland pad thai is supposed to burst with the flavors of tamarind fish sauce bean sprouts and peanuts this didnt burst at all  after reading great things about the crazy pineapple fried rice i went for it but it was bad too the pineapple was absolutely delicious but didnt go well with the flavor of the fried rice which was bland and vaguely unpleasant  we paid 50 with tip for 2 entrees 2 appetizers and 2 thai iced teas   as we left i suggested we only come here again for appetizers we decided to just not come again  make the trek out to silk cuisine in bryn mawr best thai in the area hands downpeople seem to love this place for its beer selection  the two times ive been in here ive been skeeved out to the max  one time i swear there was the worst dressed pimp of all time and two of his workers    places like this should be closed theyre just fronts for liquor stores their food is inedible  yes it is nice to get a six pack for cheap no i wouldnt want one of these in my neighborhood    gotta agree with aaron avoidthe pizza was mediocre and the service was terrible they forgot one of our orders and didnt bring it to us until we were almost done eating they never refilled our drinks and i just saw them sitting around doing nothing wouldnt recommend itmy parents used to love this place around 15 years ago and they hadnt been back since my dad requested we go here for his birthday we had a reservation for 530 the place was empty my parents remembered it being hard to even get a table at 5 things have obviously changed we started with oysters and clam crab balls and clams casino the appetizers were decent it took two times of asking the waitress for a refill on my soda for it to be brought you also have to ask for oyster crackers i order the fried scallops for dinner and was i disappointed i assumed they would be full sized but instead they seem to be cut in half to decrease the volume the waitress brought me a new order when i addressed the problem and they were exactly the same i ended up with broiled scallops they were alright the rest of my family agreed that the dinner was just alright for the price you would expect something moreour group had intended to sit out in the patio but since it was too hot we decided to sit inside the restaurant  first impression it was noisy and the decor needed some upgrading  our waiter came to our table and immediately wanted us to order appetizers even though the rest of the group was still parking their cars incidentally dont go on a wednesday in the summer the parking lot is full due to people going to the farmers market  the waiter also behaved unprofessionally and kept interrupting and then didnt show up when i ask if there is a charge for a substitution on the side dish he said it would only be 1 extra after we placed our order it took a long time at least 12 hour or more to get our food the dishes were just typical bar food and not particularly warm when they finally arrived at our table  theres a great selection of good quality beer though when we got our check i noticed that i was charged 450 for the substitution of the side order  when i questioned the waiter in the front of our group he said thats what they charge and made no attempt to contact his manager to change it he merely said that you got an extra large order  i didnt want an extra large order so again i ask if he would change it and he just shrugged his shoulders and left   a few days later i phoned the manager to let him know about our experience he appeared to be concerned about the treatment we received i mentioned to him that it had been my turn to pick a venue for our group and frankly no one in our group was particularly pleased with the service  i told him that i was calling because i dont like to put bad reviews on yelp and hoped that he would give extra training to his employee he apologized profusely and said he would send me a gift certificate i told that that it wasnt necessary but that it would be appreciated  he said that hed send one anyway and i gave him my address i never heard back from him  not even a note that was three weeks ago so heres my reviewwas visiting indy and checking out different brewerys  this place was really hard to find its on the back side of mass ave   total hole in the wall place     i believe this place just opened and they were still working on it   the space has character    you can get a pint and some pretzels and chill out a bit   im a fan of brown ale and theirs was just incredible light for me and didnt feel any of the other beers i tried    if  youre in town stop by as im thinking this place will improvestopped in for an early dinner on a friday oct 23 and the joint was empty  while the drill is apparently that you order at the counter and then sit down we noticed that there was a small bar and asked if we could sit there the bartender seemed annoyed but indicated that we could  we sat down and two wornout menus the laminate was peeling off and the menus were creased and wrinkled to the point that they were difficult to read were thrown down in front of us   we decided to start with a cocktail  the drink menu included red and white sangria  i asked the bartender which she thought was better  she responded tersely that they were out of sangria but then added that even if they werent out they both were good and it just depended upon individual taste  okay then   my wife then ordered a margarita and i ordered the lojito cocktail  my wife liked the margarita but the lojito was too sweet for my taste and i suspect they use something other than the hand squeezed lime juice listed on the menu   we ordered queso dip and it was quite good  chips were light and crispy and the dip was the perfect consistency   not enjoying the lojito i handed it off to my wife and selected one of the beers on the menu and tried to order it  bartender then informs me that they dont have that beer and that the menu was really out of date  rather then telling me the handful of beer options that were available she told me i should walk back up to the front and look at the bottles behind the front counter to see what they had  okay then   selected a beer all bottles  no drafts and returned to my seat to order  asked for a glass with the beer and when it was given to me i was told not to break it because they only had 3 for those people that wanted a glass with their beer  okay then   from there we ordered a trio of tacos and a couple of enchiladas  food was served uberquickly by someone from the kitchen  bartender eventually threw down a couple of sets of silverware in front of us and turned her attention back to a couple of regulars that had joined us at the bar   enchiladas were very good but not really unique  the tacos were a bit more creative and feature locally made soft flour tortillas  the tortillas were definitely better than storebought but not as good as madetoorder or a good corn tortilla  southern fried taco was my favorite  local bbq taco was good but the bbq sauce was too strong and overpowered everything else   while finishing up our meal we witnessed multiple interactions between the bartender and customers and it was clear that unless you are a regular that essentially kisses up to her the bartender has no interest in you or your dining experience  maybe the food otherwise could have merited more stars our overall dining experience was meh at besti was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if i was sure i wanted to order so ill take my business elsewhere but i hear the food is really goodunfortunately the other reviews said it all this location is not someplace well likely return to  the soup was cold  they were out of several types of cookies but the cookies were awesome as always especially coconut chocolate chipive heard a lot about five guys for years and i finally had the chance to try it out when i came across this location i picked up a double cheeseburger and a cup of fries now the fries are fresh cut but i suspect they were fried in oil that was too cold because they were very greasy they got me sick to my stomach eating them the burger was okay comparable to burger king and good for fast food but not up to what you would get at a good restaurant or diner which after all the hype was what i was expecting it wasnt really bad but disappointing when i expected good and got adequatemeh a decent place to get your greasy food but theyre pretty disorganized and will likely get your order wrong  theyve almost always miss the peppers on my hot dog  they have chicago memorabilia decorating the place but the place is sparse enough that is isnt cheezy  who knew it would be so hard to find a decent hot dog placei was not impressed with much here ordered the longhorn and fries firstly they two beers that my friend and i wanted to try were out we were served room temperature water and the bottled soda i ordered was also room temp   the burgers are small and didnt really taste better than something i could make at home lacking in flavor and overall taste he ambiance is nice but i was disappointed overall by the burgers   the best thing i ordered was the peanut butter ice creamthis coffee shop is not what nashville is about  unfortunately i could extend that to all of westhaven  no friendly greeting  in fact no greeting at all  the clientele are snobs  the coffee was merely up to par  overall not a great experience wont be coming backmeh typical starbucks with expensive coffee and great pastries   i think the organization and distribution of drinks could be better a bunch of us ended up standing at the end of the counter waiting for drinks that were just being placed in front of us with no names on cups or any idea of what was in said cups   overall though service was friendly interior is cleannot so super of a superwalmart  poor selection in small vegetable section  no deli sectionunfortunately we had a bad experience herewe actually ate outside on the to go portion of this restaurant and i dont know if they put less care into their to go orders or not but it tasted bad we got the coconut shrimp which was okdefinitely over fried we got the lobster tacos which were literally awful tasted like rubber on bitter cabbage with a squeeze of lemonand the worst of it was that it was 1895 to be honest the clam chowder was really good as well as their arnold palmer to drink and thats about it not worth the price or the wait at all for usmeh this pizza was basically a deepdish grease pie not my style at all  the wings were ok but nothing special we got ranch as a dipping sauce instead of blue cheese which i thought was a little weird  we probably wont be going back here it wasnt specialthe pizza is good great gluten free options the staff in charge of answering the phones seem like they are high and dont care about doing anything involving conflict resolution there were two instances where my pizzas were not delivered and no recourse was offered the second instance they literally said o we have your pizzas going to another house would you like a refund or terrible customer service i hope this changes because i like the foodwhy why why do i keep going back to night market isnt the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results i dont know why i keep expecting to have a good experience at a night market   in theory this sounds like a cool event well apparently by the size of the crowd im not the only one that thinks this i mean night market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people   i didnt have much time to dedicate to south street night market my group probably got to south street around 730 and had to leave for another event by 9930 rather than waiting in a beer line we beelined to the state store what a saving grace we were able to buy juice boxes of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street   earlier in the day i had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 2025 places i would like to try i had hoped to hit at least 23 places wishful thinking i know i was being picky about my selections and expectations i wanted to try a vendor that ive never had before and i didnt want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that i can visit any old day we started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th i knew i had to make a quick decision if i wanted to eat before leaving kachi was in the right place at the right time luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors  i spent the majority of my time at night market waiting in that line i was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worseit also could have been better ill review kachi separately but in short the food was good and im glad i waited but it really wasnt worth the wait  philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an off day unfortunately i was only able to eat at one vendor and not make a dent on my ambitious list   i think ill be passing on the next night market in china town unless the allure sucks me back inhad the perogies with sausage just average  the hamburger was a frozen patty no taste for juice sent it back they took it off the bill wont come back hereim leaving a review because the delbert service at this place was terrible i ordered some delivery with my roommate on a sunday night from this place after over an hour went by we still hadnt gotten our food when i called back the guy on the phone said the driver delivered our food to the wrong house but was on the way when he got there about ten minutes later the food obviously wasnt very warm i will admit my falafel wrap and salad were fresh and pretty good but i obviously would have preferred it warmer when the driver dropped the food off i mentioned that i ordered a smoothie that wasnt with my order he said he would go back and get it then come back after 20 mins i had a feeling he wouldnt be coming back i called back the store but they must have been closed lou the man on the phone actually called me back and told me the driver went to his other job he was courteous enough to provide me with two free smoothies the next day so i appreciated that but i wasnt happy the driver decided to just go to his other job overall the food was good and lou was very nice on the phone and professional but i suggest he find another driver so he doesnt alienate other customers who may order delivery in the futureextensive menu and they were pretty busy for a weeknight  they have a nice private roomfor use and lots of sports decor as expected  this new location still has some work to do pretty average sports bar  house wine was fine but the wings came out much hotter than they were supposed to even the second time around  their bbque sauce is spicy service was pretty good  nothing terribly special going on hereno smiles running out of food but not communicating to teammates loud enough what is needed arguing amongst each other giving me a non existent portion instead of waiting for your refills to come i love chipotle but this was the most depressing visit ever ill stick to your other locationsoverrated we brought out of town guests here because it was on their touristy wish list we expected to wait in line typical for nashville about 45 minutes so no big deal   once seated we basically were at the mercy of the slowest waitress alive we had a big day planned but our group of four spent nearly 2 hours of it sitting in a booth waiting on food drink refills that never came and after asking other servers to find our no show waitress the check no wonder there is a line to get when the table turnover is ridiculously slow  as for the food just meh after the hype and the wait i expected large flavorful portions the portions were on the small side and no one was impressed with the taste i think my dish was the most well liked santa fe cornmeal pancakes they were hearty and unusual so they were a good pick   all of us ordered a side of hashbrowns and lucky we did or we would have been very hungry later on but i did have to blot a good amount of oil off the potatoes and the bottom of the dish i know that hashbrowns arent a health food so no biggie just excessive   overall an eclectic tourist stop i cant understand why locals would go there are better cheaper faster and more delicious options all over town go if you have time to kill and a lot of patiencegiving noboru 2 stars is my way of being generous   i went for dinner over the weekend with some friends and we were very disappointed considering the price for dinner we all had expected a lot more  at first glance it appears as though there is a lot of sushi however after a closer look we realized there actually was about 5 different types of sushi all with slight variations for example there was a shrimp roll shrimp tempura spicy shrimp tempura shrimp tempura sandwich and shrimp tempura with a special sauce im sorry but that is not a good selection  after we ate some sushi we decided to try some of their other dishes as well the sesame chicken was pretty good if it was fresh if it sat out for more than 15 minutes it would dry out and become hard to chew also the fried rice was really bland and had a awkward texture   i know people go to noboru for the dinner but not the dessert but since they had dessert we had to try it on noborus website and facebook page they advertise chocolate covered strawberries and even crepes we saw nothing of the sort there were miniature cookies which gave one of my friends and i a laugh because they were advertised as homemade when they clearly came from the nearest acme they also offered 3 small pieces of jello in a bowl some fruit mini cakes mini brownies vanilla soft serve ice cream and tart frozen yogurt which as a major fro yo fan i was very disappointed in  the only dessert item that my table semienjoyed were the brownies   finally i do have to say their cold veggies were delicious i read some reviews prior to going and one reviewer mentioned how great the asparagus was im so glad i read their review and made sure to try the asparagus because it was by far my favorite item there my only suggestion would be that while good cold it should be served warm i had one piece that was under a heat lamp and was so warm and delicious  overall i would say avoid noboru unless you really like shrimp and overpaying for food it may have been the cleanest buffet i have ever been to but no matter how clean a place is if the food is not good then it is not worth iti was expecting the burgers to be delicious but they werent theyre extremely greasy as i was eating mine a pool of grease formed on my plate pretty gross also the waitress was slow so our bottomless fries took a long time quick service but very disappointed by the bagels nothing great at all can probably get better quality bagels in a grocery store certainly not bageliciouspricey food and subpar service the half of any sandwich or melt looks like a crust only three people and they took forever to make the food understaffed on that sundaystaff is great the hot roast beef wasnt hot it was barely luke warm the bread was warmer than the meat took a few bites the flavors are nice but i didnt finish it was coldthis place has the worst service i only have this place 2 stars because they have a waiter there named crystal only ask for crystal if you want to have good service the rest are dumb bimbos last time i ate we wanted some fries never even got a refill and the only reason we had fries in the first place was crystal she gave us some before we even ordered and wasnt even our waiter  management sucks we complained and said well why didnt you say anything to her before yeah so she could spit on our foodnot the greatest fast food place to hit at night  i was driving through one night and had to stop and use the restroom and get some food the employees looked at me with almost disqust that i was in there not that im one of those people but maybe i was the wrong white girl in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time not really sure its pretty much almost downtown past the arch right off 70 so it was convenient it was pretty clean for the most part as well just didnt like the whole vibe going on insidethe bakery item list is very impressive and most items weve sampled have been really good especially for a new business  be careful however as they may change their hours with no notice for example this evening we tried to go just after 10pm and they are closed when the hours are until 11pm there was no change to the website and no change on yelpso i generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review my husband and i arrived and were placed on the wait list no big deal some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order the pizza was no better than pizza hut we were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza the artichoke dip came out most of the chips were small pieces hardly suitable for dipping the waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins she seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those the flat bread pizza was something kids could make on grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients  to me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price expected higher quality for the price the appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive probably wont go back because there are local nonchain restaurants that are far betterthis place is always packed i expected the best  when i stepped out of my car it smelled soooo goood  my tummy was ready for some boiled shrimp corn and potatoes but sadly the shrimp was incredibly spongy over cooked maybe old the waitress was nice enough to get me new basket but it was the same the shell was stuck to the shrimp and to top it all there was no flavor my coworkers orderer poboys and they complaint about the bread which was hard they ate the inside of the poboy and said the taste was average i was so disappointed the service was great but  whats going on in the kitchenso much hype with ehh delivery the biscuits and gravy were so hard and lacking flavorthis is one of my favorite places to get coffee so i finally decided to come for breakfast after hearing great reviews and i was not impressed i got the open egg sandwich with avocado and after a long wait it finally came out barely warm the avocado which i paid extra for was unripe and completely inedible the breakfast potatoes were good but overall it was definitely not worth what i paid for it and i definitely would not get it againwe did not get a good experience from the start the moment we walked in the manager greeted us in a lackluster style   the buffet was okay most of the food was lukewarmwhich is never good for a restaurant the only dishes that shined through were the chicken tikka masala delicious and the kheer unusually good with a pinch of cinnamon the rest of the dishes were just okay the rice tasted undercooked and while we were eating the manager started closing down the buffetthat is never good while customers are eating it all felt really rushed   all in all lukewarm food lousy customer service and the manager was in a hurryi came again tonight for margarita madness it has been over a year since my last visit i only went because a friend who was visiting from out of town wanted to go also 1 tacos and 230 margaritas may have pulled me in as well we arrived at 8 and waited 25 minutes and we still had not been asked for our drink order we decided to go inside to the bar to order our margaritas in all fairness they were extremely busy even out on the patio where we sat but still 25 minutes for drinks seemed extreme since we had so much time to sit around i had plenty of time to observe the environment the chairs outside are hard metal chairs with open slats on the bottom that are just not comfortable at all the overhang above the patio was kind of grody looking overall our server was nice probably just overworked after we got our drinks our table of 8 ordered a ton of the beef or refried bean tacos they just had lettuce and cheese on top but not bad for the price the chips and salsa was still just meh nothing impressive ive had better salsa from a jar the server did bring out the tacos much quicker than the drinks but still the whole experience took forever  inside while waiting at the bar for drinks i noticed yet again that the live band was extremely loud far too loud for a monday night restaurant crowd at that point i was glad we sat outside  based on this visit id probably give 25 stars but im still not totally sold on poblanossoive been here a few times for trivia a beer etc its a fine atmosphere to go hang out and have a drink my issue is with the food so a few of my friends got back from a long day and we wanted to order food bc we were too tired to go out we ordered via door step delivery  we all went with some basics boneless wings loaded fries burger and fries considering this is a bar we figured theyd have a lock on pub food we were wrong the food was so awful and can i just say that i rarely think food is too gross to finishwell i didnt want to finish we all shared bites of each and we all agreed the food was gross the fries had a weird downright gross taste the teriyaki wings were so salty and looked unappetizing with this super gross looking breading we ended up throwing all the food in the garbage what a waste i would considering coming back for a drinkill just make sure ive eaten first yuckthe food was great if you ever get seated while i can understand its a small establishment the person running the seating chart was just awful they were not seating by any sort of logical reasoning and lots of people who waited one hour were getting cut by those who waited ten minutes if you go be preparedlike others ive been a fan of bareburger today i am disappointed and questioning that ill go back even with a groupon and a 10 credit   bottom line i invest in you you need to invest in customer service training and scripting   ive been to brooklyn bareburger a bunch of times for dinein and takeout no problems   i dined in once at walnut st and had no complaints worth writing today i ordered takeout and am now doubting that i will ever go back   i ordered the wiki wiki and a full order of sweet fries with curry ginger ketchup to go i drank a mexican mule while i waited no complaints about the drink i live a distance from the restaurant so i wasnt expecting the perfect experience when i got home i just wanted my bareburger   while waiting i sent the groupon to skeptical friends you know the ones who cant see paying over 20 for a burger and fries yeah i was a fan i left happy   when i got home i saw that id been given a side order of regular fries with a single packet of generic ketchup disappointing yes but not fatal what ruined the experience was poor communication   the bartender whom id liked first responded by saying he hadnt bagged my order not helpful since we both knew i was there and already knew this then he added that he would look into the problem if only he had said the second part without the first at one point he commented that he knew i was so looking forward to the sweet fries this sounded condescending particularly since i hadnt shared any sweet fry fetish with him after he offered me a credit for exactly what i was missing i asked to speak with a manager   the managers johns first response was but that was a while ago i offered to send a snapshot of what id received and he declined i then told him just how far away i live i wont write about how inappropriate it is to begin a customer service call with skepticism im not a trainer at bareburger but the implications of this sort of approach can be found in the writing of ta nehisi coates   then john confused my complaint thinking id received sweets when i wanted plain fries i corrected him as did a voice in the background then john suggested that everything was probably gross by the time i got home it sounded and felt as snarkydismissivedisrespectfulunhelpful as it reads i asked him to clarify the point of that statement he dropped that tactic and explained that theyd normally deliver the corrected order but i was too far away i expressed that i understood   i asked john to tell me what he could do since a credit for exactly what i was missing seemed inadequate he asked me how id paid groupon plus a credit card told me he could look into contacting groupon and told me he didnt know how that worked i asked again what can you do john i also explained again that an even credit wasnt enough for the current disappointment   finally he explained that they usually add a little extra to the credit to make up for a past error he used the price of a side order as an example i asked him what the credit would be for exactly what id ordered then we got to 10 and an apology   i still dont know why it was so hard customer service skills are not automatic and my sense is that bareburger is winging it unfortunately winging it has had an alienating effect on me im contacting bareburger corporate and groupon for a more satisfactory customer service experiencelove the food but the customer service is horrible they almost never answer the phone but they answered it tonight and told me i had to be there by 930 but they close at 10i wanted woodfired eggs from sister venue lucky penny and was hoping helena bakery would have them but they dont so i ordered an espresso drink to go i waited 15 minutes for that drink why only one barista on a busy saturday morning the owners should reopen lucky penny for breakfast because helena bakery is busier than they can handle and i want my woodfired eggs they have improved their selection of baked goods since last yearconcept is good but the taste is below average i got a rice bowl with spicy chicken curry and lamb vindaloo its not even close to what it should taste like staff is friendly  ambience is good  concept was great but taste sucks i felt it was a waste of moneyi was somewhat disappointed by the burgers at 500 degrees not the taste but the size the burger was exceptionally small and i would have had to eaten two to be full   i did have a chance to sample the truffle fries which were pretty solid but overall for the price of the food it was not worth the tripi usually like the oysters here but this time i had lunch  mediocre at best and really enjoyed a disgruntled server dropping the fbomb through the bar cause the bartender was busy and they had to pour a glass of winemy wife and i went to cinco de mayo on a busy friday night we waited over 40 minutes to have our orders taken then another 30 minutes for our food when it did come out it was relatively burntdry and unseasoned we also feel like we got a paltry serving portion and very poor service water glasses stayed empty the whole time chips were very dry and stale they also said they dont have drink specials we have been to the cinco de mayo in brentwood many times received excellent service food and drinks and will return there if we wish to frequent a cdm in the futurei went there because i heard they have good ribs well i walked in and the lady said we are not open probably another hour mind you its going on 4pm this place serves breakfast lunch and dinner so i dont know why they would not be open i left and came back the next day me and my cousin ordered two chicken wing platters the chicken had absolutely no flavor or season the greens i have had way better the mac and cheese was ok but i have had better as well cabbage was horrid and the yams was really good lemon and strawberry cake was really good as well icing is very sweet though i would only go back to get a slice of cake if i ever went backcouldve been an off night but as yelp puts it meh ive experienced better the grungy crowd stared me down when i walked in wearing business attire and sat down to wait for a friend once she arrived our frazzled waitress poured glasses of water before flitting off to wait on ten other tables four of which were outside returning very intermittently the front and porch doors were left open breezing 50 degree weather past us for the entirety of our meal it was not a comfortable place to eat  the restaurant welcomed vegetarian menu in an otherwise carnivorous town the hummus was a little dry and my volatoo indian rice bowl too liquid and bland note i like my food spicier than your average american but it still was below standards after asking for extra spice my friend commented her thai peanut sauce was also blander than she had expected i would not reorder these three dishes  the crowd grew as the evening continued leading me to think live music began after dinnertime but i was in no mood to stay after eatingvery underwhelming if you dont mind bland tacos sans sauce and dry chewy meats then this place is for you also the food came out icecold  i never send food back to the kitchen but actually had to send two tacos back here the jerk chicken tacos were like naked dry chicken breasts in search of some flavor and slaw after choking down the first bite i decided to request toppings be added   im giving two stars instead of one because i like their patio unless its for drinks i dont plan to returnmothers day brunch made reservations so all good  friendly greeting and they showed us right to our table  steak and eggs pancakes omelet  all very very good  the food here really is excellent  weekend bloody mary bar smaller than others but still nice for the price and they have different mixes of spiciness  outstanding coffee  as always   the problem is the service  our server was lauren who is absolutely in the wrong job for her skills it i think this may be the height of her capabilities  no silverware on the table  she didnt notice and i had to get up and ask for it  she had no intuitive abilities as to what should normally accompany food items  her demeanor and personality were also very flat almost a forced cordiality because she was being forced to serve us  what would otherwise be a fantastic five star meal was made uncomfortable by her incompetence as a server  i really wish blondies would pay attention to the job their servers are doing  so much about this place i like  but the service is literally there worst on wash ave we may give them another try just so many other options that we can walk toi went in at 915 am for breakfast didnt get my food until 10 and there were numerous employees but no one at the register they have it set up so you order at the sandwich counter and then get back in line at a different counter to pay just seemed dumbone thing to know about this place is that youll definitely get your monies worth portions wise i was impressed with the scrimp scampi portion i received that came with a choice of salad which was also a nice portion  my only major critique is that the shrimp in my scampi were slightly undercookedseasoned since the shrimp make up a big part of the dish that was a slight disappointment  because the portions i got were so big i was able to take them home with me and they were nice leftovers  despite one pitfall with the shrimp i would be willing to try them out again  im giving them a two for now however i do plan to visit again and possibly do a rereviewwent in to eat and the shells were cold and there was little meat to the tacos  my advice  go the one in avonwe went on a saturday night around 830 pm it was a rather small crowd for the weekend the waiting staff was very nice and professional and on time with orders and requests  we ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer though a bit overcooked it was good bread and antipasto were brought to the table they both were very cold like it was just taken out of the fridge for drinks my gf ordered a watermelon lemonade martini which was super strong  and i just ordered a ginger ale for entrees i ordered the linguine ponza which was good but shrimps were a bit overcooked which was disappointing she ordered the crab ravioli which was delicious overall i give this restaurant two stars and think that will be my last time comingman i have to say i was disappointed after reading some of the good reviews on here for pomme cafe  the space is wonderful and the service was nice ok wine selection but my food was pretty awful  i got the duck confit salad  it was a heaping hot literally mess of soggy duck not a true confit thats for sure on some bib and romaine odd lettuce with a few dried cherries and huge hunks of sauteed apples  underdressed  some goat cheese might be a good addition to  it definitely needed something  it looked and was unappetizing  maybe i just ordered the wrong thing  again space staff and wine are ok but thats about ityou moved you changed why this place used to be a secret gym and now with this recent changes lowered its status the service is not with a smile and food is just ok i just dont get it you moved no theres no seats and youre selling tampons and toilet paper and dog food who made these decisionslive five minutes from this place i like the concept and the unique drink options the gingerbeet pink lemonade is awesome big fan but the burgers are average at best and over priced the meat its self i found was dry given theyre going for the whole health conscious scene there probably using 9010 burgers which is why theyre dry as hell the jalapeo ranch here is amazing but for the amount you spend me and my buddy who is half my size walked out of there still hungry so in the end it comes down to average food good drinks but leaving unsatisfiedthis place was once my favorite but this recent experience wasnt the greatest the waiter left us waiting for 15 minutes without ordering we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks its not excuse for being busy there needs to be a better plan on timemanagement customer service training and for proper communication etiquette always takes forever for service yet so impatient for the check also theres not enough vegan options and chocolatecaffeinefree dessertsthree adults and two teens for postbeach dinner great menu with plenty of options we did calamari and onion rings for an app along with some adult cocktails our meals came out a bit later and i instantly thought joes crab shack plenty of white space on the burger and grouper sandwich plates maybe a pickle or at the very least load up the fries wife had mahi tacos with mango salsa i took a bite the mango was not ripe yet and the mahi was dry from over cooking i had the key west sampler platter it was average at best this place is overhyped and primarily a tourist trap i will not returnservice is pretty slow and the employees seem less than happy to be working  they seem like they rather socialize with themselves than the customers or even helping the customers  food is good for jack in the box thoughthe positive  the building is beautiful  came in on sunday around 745 after seeing a movie  there was an hour wait for a table of two but the bar was pretty empty so we decided to eat there    they had four of their own beer on tap we tried the ipa and the saison  decent but not great i preferred the ipa  the menu prices were a little higher than we expected ranging from 14 for a burger to near 30 for other menu items    we ordered the special for the evening lamb gyro and the roasted chicken  the lamb was tender but it had very little tzatziki sauce  it needed some fresh tomatoes and onion  i just used homemade ketchup that was served for my fries    they really must like fries here because that is what was served with the chicken as well no veggies  just fries and chicken with some ketchup and honey mustard sauce  for 18 a plate there had better be some more than meat and a starch the chicken was on the dry side   the bartenders need to engage all of the customers better  at least that is how i felt until some young 20 something ladies came in  they seemed to get all the attention they wanted and more from the staff that night   i am an out going person and tried to make small chit chat with them but they werent having any of it i guess us 30 something couples are left to the side as we dont have date potential for the staff   we did get our chicken comped due to the dryness the bartender said that according to the souschef they are going to be changing the menu up a little in a couple of weeks  i hope that adding veggies are included in the changes  not sure if we will be back to see if they doi wanted to like this place  i really enjoy spice shops  but this leaves much to be desired its very dusty and run down  i felt like i had stepped onto the set of an episode of dr quinn medicine woman and not in a good way   its one thing to provide customers with an old timey experience but you shouldnt be so dusty that they feel wary about purchasing food products from your establishment   there was nothing that they sold that was so well priced or so rare that i had to have it so i left empty handed   sadly the spice shop is becoming extinct because if you really need something rare you can always order it online for a good price from a company like monteray spice co   but if youre in philadelphia and need something quickly or in just the right amount head to the head nut at reading terminal marketthe girl in the drive thru had an attitude with me when i asked about the puppy cup she wasnt friendly at all when i got the puppy cup it had one dollop of whip cream so then i ask if i could have some more and she barely gives me anything and says surelike thats not cool if its such a problem and hassle ill pay thats not the issue i go to this starbucks all the time i dont know what her issue is but she needs to fix itgot a groupon for the lady jane package for me and my mom to go it came with a soup and salad the soup was so watered down and had no flavor and the salad was about 3 pieces of baby spinach and about 2 grape tomatoes and came with an apple vinaigrette they didnt let you pick your own dressing it also came with a tower of sandwiches and 2 scones for each person out of about 6 different sandwiches on the platter there were only about 2 that were edible the rest were absolutely horrible the tea was good and the scones were alright but thats all i could ever see anyone going there for if you are planning on a meal i would eat somewhere before and just go for tea and scones was not pleased with what they had to offer i am very happy i just had a groupon and did not pay the full price for this i would have been very disappointed and tried to ask for money back because it was just very horrible i would not recommend it to anyone unless they just wanted to have tea i would not get anything else from thereafter reading the reviews we had high expectations  we arrived at 5pm on saturday evening to a packed brewery   we were told the wait was an hour  there were tables in the bar and we waited until we were able to snag one unfortunately the bar menu is not the same as the dining menu  we ordered chips and stuff to munch on while we waited   the chips guacamole and pured bean salsa were actually the highlight of our meal   i ordered a beer  beware there are no traditional beers here  they only sell what is made in the brewery   they also do not sell soda  my kids had ice tea which was extremely bitter  too bad the bartender has not mentioned this to me    the real disappointment was the fish tacos  as previous people have stated where is the fish  i felt like i was eating nothing but breading   at 12 for two tacos i expect more then fried batter   i also expect red cabbage cole slaw on a fish taco  our waitress was nice and so was the host not a place i would ever eat at again   i am actually surprised at the high ratings   my daughter and her friend had the hummus appetizer which they said was pretty goodthis is a wonderful pizza place and is true to its roots great restaurant to stop in before a concert or lightning game only complaint is that the service is lacking waited nearly two hours to get our meal after they realized they screwed up a calzonewent for a brunch on a sunday morning and wow didnt realize the wait would be so long for basic food heard from many people how good it was and was disapointed had the chicken and waffles and was a chicken strip with super dry syrup on a waffle expected more for the pricei go here when going to winco is too inconvenient or when i need a small amount of items even with their just 4 u app prices are very high their organic produce selection is pathetic and most of the time they are out of things like jalapeos  or other normal items one might be looking for thats annoying theyre also usually out of whatever happens to be a good deal tonight they were out of the salsa that was on saleso i had to pay the same amount for less than half the size the deli selection is good so thats why i give them 2 stars i would give more stars if their checkers were pleasantever maybe ive just had bad luck at their storebut ive gone to this safeway a lot and tonights annoyances were just too much all at once i wish their was a local grocery store in sparks with good organic produce decent prices and friendly peopleive been very disappointed with nelsons this year i had cherry vanilla ice cream and it only had one cherry in it then i gave them another try and the mint chocolate chip was low on chips also are they cutting back to save moneypizza is great but the staff is awful and the delivery is the worst we have been devoted customers and truly love the pizza so we try so hard to stay loyal and keep our business with foxs but when every single time you order and your told delivery is going to take x amount of time then its delivered 30 mins past and thats being generous that time it gets old im sorry but in order to keep your customers you need to have competent staff and honest delivery times   zionsville pizzeria here we comei wont be returning here the waiter seemed overwhelmed and not as attentive as he could have been the food took roughly 35 minutes to finally come and when it did it was lukewarm by that point our table of 7 was so hungry that no one wanted to bother returning their food and waiting longer i did bring this to the attention of the manager who offered comp drinks and to remove one of my friends items from the check that was little consolation however to the underwhelming experience had here i hope they are able to work on being more efficient because i did not have an enjoyable time here at allwe were a party of 10 with 6 kids it took more than an hour to get our food and the place was only half full in addition once we got the food it wasnt as we ordered and we had a couple of upset and hungry kids we love the willow grove location and were very happy to have one closer we wont visit this location againmurphys prepared smoked items need help  bought the murphys cooked smoked ribs on one visit they were horrible  recently bought murphys smoked baked beans from the taste appearance and smell it seems like they opened a can of prepared baked beans and added artificial smoke flavoring and sugar they were vile and 24 hours lateri still cannot get the smoke smell out of my microwave  discontinue these items or vastly improve themimprovement is slow  food is same but at least they have a few friendlier people  i wish they offered some specialsnot a retail location  came up on a sat morning closed this looks more like a dentist office then a juice shopwell the girl at the counter did not know what a pour over was that should tell anyone looking for a good coffee how much of a coffee house this is so i ordered an iced americano instead extra room for cream she brought me three little creamer pods anyway ive had worse but ive also had much much better not a coffee house with an expertise in coffee thats for sureim not sure what the hype is about for this place ordered two donuts two sliders waffle cheese fries and iced tea the donuts were nothing to write home about didnt taste particularly fresh and there werent many options to chose from most of the ones in the delicious looking yelp pics were not available i went around 12pm so perhaps coming in the morning you may have a better experience    the sliders were good a little pricey at 325 a pop when two definitely arent going to fill you up the waffle fries themselves were pretty good stay away from the cheese sauce though it was waaay too thick and just had an odd consistency overall it tasted like the time i tried to make homemade nacho cheese sauce at home it had a roux consistency but for my personal tastes didnt pair well with the fries or even taste particularly cheesy  not worth the price in my opinion but i did enjoy the atmospherewhile i love supporting local businesses and its nice to have an alternative to whole foods i find this place lacking on quality and freshness i got a premade vegan sandwich from here before and was not impressed considering the steep price  very dry and lackluster a lot of the produce is bruised and slightly wilted they also dont carry staples like baguettes  its okay if you just need to stop in to grab a few items but youll find better quality and prices a few blocks farther down south street at whole foodswe came here on a sunday evening around 730 and had 7 people in our party with chicken tender  club sandwich and grilled chicken orders and it took 50 minutes to get our food and it was missing 2 peoples side items  while it wasnt the waitresss fault she also didnt attempt to recitify the situation and we saw her a total of 3 times during our wait with one of those being when she took our drink and food order the manager did take 2 entrees off the bill but we wont ever be going back used to really like this place but had since gone downhill ate there today food was slow and overall bad the food looked slopped on the plate additionally everything just felt and looked dirty you could even see stacks of unwashed plates in the kitchen to top off our experience my wife and i both got sick shortly thereafter probably our last visit here with plenty of other much better options nearbylove panda this location has serious management issues 2 stars is a stretch but when you do get the food it is good  every time i go they never have adequate staffing and the staff always complain that theyve been shortstaffed all day  one time i went in they had 2 options for entrees orange chicken and something else and everything else had a wait and the line was to the door with about 15 people in line which is what another reviewer mentioned as well as the posted pictures and this has happened on multiple occasions they seem to have 2 people cooking 1 person washing dishes and 1 person serving food maybe 2  one time there was a line to the door and only 1 poor girl to serve food while there was 1 girl and 1 cook sitting down at the table in clear sight i understand they legally have to take their lunch but dont do it in front of a line of customers who are watching you  i asked for one of the premium items one time that costs 1 more and they said its frozen and has to be prepared and would take at least 20 minutesif i wanted to wait that long i would have went to a sitdown restaurant  please review this place if you experience similar as they hopefully will make some changestaste was decent nothing compared to the so philly tony lukes  sandwiches are half the size of the original tony lukes and priced higher love the so philly tony lukes wont return to the maple shade locationi used to love georges wings i ordered from them this weekend and it has gone downhill their boneless wings arent good anymore giant pieces of chicken and the chicken is gross too much breading and drowned in sauce the girl at the counter was extremely rude to us as well im disappointed they were one of my favorite places but i will not order from them againthis review is for service only not the food  i love blakes crushed icei know thats a strange thing to love but its true  i am even willing to wait in the drive through line for just a soda  and thats what i did yesterday but wow i wish i hadnt  there was only one car in front of me so it shouldnt have been that long of a wait  wrong  after placing my order and then finally making it to the window 10 minutes no one came to the window for another 5 and when they did they had to ask me what i had ordered again  when i told them it took another 5 for them to make the soda and get it for me  and another 3 to get my change  pretty ridiculous wait for a soda  get it together blakeswe took home the two meat lasagna the only meat i could taste was ground beef and not any italian sausage which really should dominate flavorless lasagna with sauce that you have to put on after the entree has baked that is mexican foodtype hot and not italian    very clean place with nice staff but we will not be returningi wish i loved this place as much as everyone else seems to  very average falafel served slowly and slightly overpriced  banana bread was dry and overall not good  ok in a pinch but not anything to write home aboutthis location is hit or miss ate here yesterday and it was dried up crusty barely warm drive past this one there are much better locationsservice  atmosphere are great the food is particularly bland portions are large but flavor is lacking11 for 3 count em 3  raviolis  really  small plate portions should not cost that much  it amazes me how people will rave about a place and not notice or care that theyre being price gouged  pizza wasnt that great either and we had a couple rotten tomatoes on the salad  there are many better options for italian food than here  but as long as people are willing to pay overpriced eateries will continue to get away with small portions and big pricesalways wanted to visit this restaurant since the outside made it seem inviting and fancy finally saw the inside and did not expect it to look like a plain old building wasnt impressed came here for lunch on a friday and the service was slow and disorganized it wasnt even busy the food didnt make it any better it was mediocre at best this will be my first and last time ill give two stars since you get free bread but doesnt almost every italian spot do thatthanks i wanted to order but they wont deliver 4 miles from their store i dont understand that one  but perhaps they dont need the business looked great too very disappointed for surefood was good the ac was broken where they sat us it smelled like an elderly persons diaper we got to eat next to a dustpan filled with food trash two different people brought our food and they both forgot my side of ranch food quality was ok like a poor mans innout with the exception of higher pricespathetic service we ordered the food and waited for 20 mins the pager didnt ring for another 10 mins after waiting 25 mins went and checked for the order i was told the pager died for some reason the food was cold and the front desk didnt even offered to say sorry sorry panera curlew rd centre you guys need some training the two star is for the cold food that i have paidthe quality of the food is great but the service is horrible in addition i had an unpleasant experience on my last visit a couple of months ago and vowed not to go back picked up a carry out order after waiting well beyond when they said it would be ready while at a stop light on my way home i decided to vent the sesame chicken container to keep it from getting soggy there was no sesame chicken in the bag i drove back and they admitted they had given me the wrong order there was a person sitting there and it was determined it was her food they tried to get her to accept the food that i had taken from the restaurant and had been in my car i would never want food that someone else had had in their possession and neither did she she finally got them to agree to make her new food cant believe she even had to ask then because they had charged me for the wrong order they made me pay them the difference of 432 before giving me my food im sorry but wasnt i the one inconvenienced by having to drive back i was shocked they tried to collect they lost a regular patron because of poor customer service if it hadnt been so late and had there not been a household of starving people waiting to eat i would have told them to keep their food and would have asked for a refundweve gone here 3 times snow and its an okay place for a night out  the food is generally chain quality and not exceptionally flavorful i feel the same about their beers as well service was good each time and meals were brought out in a reasonable amount of time its one of those places you end up at once or twice a year when you dont feel like driving any distance  with the amount of high quality gastropubs just across the bridge its hard to accept the blandness delivered herewent to this place obviously geared to out of town conventioneers because it was convenient to meeting coworkers all staying at various hotels around the convention center  my low expectations were easily met  as expected the food was incredibly bland boring and fairly bad i felt like i was in an oldschool chain restaurant like a place out of the early 90s  the adventureless palates were predictably satisfied and were at home with the uninspired menu and the servers schtick if you care about food there are far better options in this town  i really want to give it only one star but that feels a bit like piling onzoey at the cashier area is super rude there was almost no one in there and i had my hands full of stuff and she told me very rudely that i could not set down my items at the cashier area for a moment i had four water bottles so it did take up that much space there was a sign there that said not to place items there but i didnt see it as i had dark sunglasses on all i had to do was pick up my chicken salad at the other area which was already ordered and walk right back over there were two other customers in there thats it and plenty of room on the counter i had tried to place my stuff way out of the way too any other customer would have had the entire counter space but for my little corner at the opposite end blocked by some cheese crackers anyway its just that she was so rude about it i was in there awhile ago too and same woman zoey and same rudeness only the last time i was in there there was no sign and no other customers shes an middleaged older woman 50s with blonde hair average build raspy voice there was just no reason she cant be polite i was super nice and asked if i could set my water there quickly i just hasnt seen the sign but still why be so rude i think they should find someone else   the food is good however but i will now find someplace else to go when im in the areaonly ordered there pizza but man is it salty and just plain lack of toppings doesnt help but the crust is cardboard new to area i just want a good pizza but for anyone new to port richey area theres no such thing  not good tasting and not good visuallythis place was okay i think my favorite thing had to be the beef wrapped pancake it had good texture and good flavor other than that i wasnt impressed the crispy tofu was too mushy on the inside the beef and tendon soup was very aromatic which tricked me once i tasted it it was completely lacking in flavor it tasted like generic beef broth with some star anise thrown in  they did have good service and the place was pretty clean they have a tv to watch games and some people were studying there  the boba drinks werent bad they have all the common flavors started at 375 for a small add 50 cents for boba and add 50 cents to make it a large i think 475 is pretty expensive for blended ice and powdered flavoring with a little boba thrown inive been to plenty of paneras and im usually a fan  tasty sandwiches and decent coffee  usually  i went for breakfast and ordered a sandwich and iced coffee  the avocado egg white and spinach sandwich was fine  nothing to comment there  coffee was a different story  first off i was given a paper cup  i did a doubletake and thought maybe she heard me say hot coffee instead  i checked the receipt and it did indeed say iced coffee  thats fine no biggie  i got a little bit of ice and filled up with iced coffee  i took and sip and thought i was drinking water mildly flavored with coffee  i thought maybe i added too much ice though in retrospect not enough time had elapsed for much melting to occur  i poured it out and filled up with just the iced coffee  same thing  okay maybe thats why i was given a paper cup  because i was going to be forced to go with hot coffee instead  most paneras ive been do have a nice spread of coffee  this one had decaf light roast dark roast and hazelnut  not a great selection but it would do  i went with hazelnut  nothing  fine i went with the dark roast  i found a worker to report the two issues  iced coffee that tasted like water and hazelnut coffee being out  five minutes later on my way out i noticed that there was a sign on the hazelnut coffee which i imagine said it was out  i just think for an establishment that sells coffee you need to keep better track of how much coffee is left  especially during breakfast hoursi think this place is over priced and unless you have a coupon its not worth it  most times we call for take out and most often put on hold  we use to try and get delivery but the delivery time they quote is always outrageous so we now opt just for pick up    last time i ordered a salad which they put in the bag with other hot food  i certainly didnt want to pay for an already overpriced side salad that was wilted and warm because it was sitting with the hot food    the hot wings were unimpressive small and not worth the  we paid  the  bright spot is the pizza  they have interesting toppings and i do love the bbt  for the money i think theres better places to goi think im over natural cafe the other day i ordered my usual sb veggie grill and realized it no longer comes with the tahini sauce its just grilled veggies on brown rice when i asked what happened to the sauce the employee said it now costs 2 extra  its already 1150 for the plate grilled veggies and tofu on a bed of brown rice unless theres something about tahini being super expensive that i dont know about i dont get why you would take away a sauce from a menu item and then charge for it i think thats bad businessi have been here twice and was displeased both times if you like cooked sushi swimming in too much mayobased sauce have at it neither time did it taste fresh and more than half the rolls are deep fried or cooked in some way the menu is enormous and yet none of the signature rolls sound appealing dont botheramerican spirits has a good selection but likely the least friendly staff youll ever meet i go here purely out of conveniencethis place somehow is always a miss for me thought i would give it a second chance with the chicken pad thai and the brian special banh mi sandwich but both were a miss the pad thai was spicy as i requested it the taste was not as desireable the banh mi is very sad they are open about getting their bread from the publix down the street and that in itself tells a lot not every authentic or good its always a miss once a year kind of thing  if thatmy girlfriend and i stopped by a week ago to eat  we both got the teriyaki steak sandwich and two drinksthe steak was raw in the middlewe too them back to the window and took the server that they were raw and he said it would be another 12 hour to get our lunch redone that he was backed up with orders  really we should be first in linenot impressedeverything about that place felt rushed no quality control or customer serviceaverage food i saw the reviews on yelp and had high expectations from this place however the food was bland americanized and simply not great tried their chicken hoagie chicken was too dry and they use the same chicken for their shawarmas and gyros tooeveryone should be familiar with friendlys  good sandwiches burgers fries and ice cream  great spot for kids  this location has horrible service  during my visit there were 2 other tables in the whole restaurant with people at them  there were 3 waitresses working  it took 5 minutes before my waitress greeted me and then another minute until she took my order  my food was delivered by a different employee  my server never asked if i wanted a refill never asked if i was ok  really poor serviceim not really sure why this place has such a high rating or maybe i ordered the wrong items but the items that i did order were a huge disappointment cmon yelp   service was good    location ocean view of course    food clam chowder by far one of the worst clam chowder ive had in a while if youre on a pier and offer clam chowder you better make it good to be fair i was at old fishermans wharf the weekend before and then i had pikes place chowder up in seattle within the last year did not like the thick chowder texture it was thick in the wrong way where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating the clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either it was 2 independent flavors from each other the soup was herby flavored more so than clam flavored  crab cakes the worst crab cake ive ever had i usually love crab cakes but this one barely tasted like crab probably because of all the spice they put into it if anything it almost had a slight curry taste for a seafood restaurant on a pier i was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat none of that the crab was really fine almost like canned texture and there was absolutely no sweet crab here just spice flavoring i was better off feeding 14 to a seagull  fresh clams in broth this was the saving grace of the entire meal the clams were sooo fresh super sweet and great texture the broth had a little too much white wine  not enough garlic for my taste it was also on the salty side but the clams omg the clams one of the clams was bad though dead taste but the rest were freshim a pretty laid back guy but i am big on manners and etiquette when i asked the manager hows your day going his response was what can i get you  the young man also proceeded to call me dude multiple times although this is a word i often use it is definitely not appropriate for a customer you do not know i still went back the next day to get some more work done but found it impossible due to the overly loud obnoxious conversation of the employees im all for a fun work environment but please respect your patrons nice enough people they just need a course on social etiquette and treating customers with respectnot the best kfc  i ordered a family dinner but apparently it just comes with loads of wallpaper paste mashed fake potatoes as sides and in the tiniest prunt on menu shows that any other side is an upcharge  ended up paying over 32 instead of 25 because we opted out of fake potatoes clerk was ignorant got home and many pieces of extra crispy chicken had breading cracked off  not agreat value any more for dinnerthe kids who work at roast are friendly  they screw up things once in a blue moon but thats to be expected  the cookies offered there are good  theyre not the best that ive ever had but theyre good all the same  the pain au chocolate is terrible  its some kind of thick chewy abomination  avoid it at all costs  the sandwiches are overpriced by about 40  the drinks are good enough but theyre not particularly memorableso the sound quality here is odd  we watched the same concert at two different locations so its easy to compare  at this location i couldnt understand what one of the acts was saying seriously i understood none of the words  i was wearing hearos rock  roll series earplugs and chalked it up to those at the time as ive never used that type before  at the other venue i wore the same earplugs and understood the vast majority of the words he said  so for the most part it wasnt the earplugs although side note i highly recommend hearos high fidelity over any other type of earplug for concert going  the show was sold out and the venue was much to tight for the amount of tickets they sold  there would be no dancing in fact there would be no moving every person that had to cross the crowd to get to the restroom was an ordeal for both that person and the crowd    the crowd was surprisingly rude in a variety of ways  this is by no means my first such show and ive been to the two coheadliners for this particular show combined probably in the ballpark of 40x so its not a oh gosh occasionally folks push or mosh at a show  take note the exact same 3 bands at another venue in san francisco 2 days later yielded much more polite attendees a much easier time moving through the crowd less sticky less aggressive less so drunk youre worried they are going to puke on you and less drinks tossed and splashing us by mistake  at the sf show maybe one person slightly annoyed me  at the reno show there were plenty  i get that some of these things are outside of the venues control but many i believe are exacerbated by having folks so uncomfortable  20 less tickets sold would have made all the difference in the world    if the person who threw the drink at someone else but nailing us as well hadnt been stepped on and shoved so many times would they have thrown the drink  if there was slightly more space would the dudebro have bothered to actually say to us im going to stand where you are standing now and literally force his way into where we had attempted to stand to stay out of the way of folks who wanted to get somewhere  would my toes have been stepped on so much  would people with long hair have been flpping their locks into your face  would i have had other folks sweat all over me  probably not  they sold more tickets than they functionally have capacity for if anyone was being honest about it    their audio control guys have a little cage around their equipment and the crowd was so large and so tightly packed the barriers ended up getting moved back like 2 or 3 feet on the side that wasnt secured down   this wasnt from anyone intentionally pushing it it was from people pushing through the crowd forcing people into it  this is really oddly placed in the middle of the venue  not middle back middle middle as in half the crowd is standing behind it and not because they dont want to be tightly packed but because there is no other option  there is no place to sit unless you want to go up to the balcony and not see any of the show  the balcony allows just a handful of people to go up and get a view pretty much the top of band members heads  and you know that might have been better than the backs of strangers heads we got to see instead while being sweated on and being hit with drinks and hit in the face with strangers hair  as it stood we watched very little of the actual show because we spent so much time doing problem avoidance  all said and done would i go here again  yes if there was no better venue option within 4 hours of me and this is a band i really wanted to see or if i thought it wouldnt sell out yielding a bit more functional space  i would not however attend this venue for a band i consider a maybemeh the truffle fries were on point  i ordered the 500 burger the sauce i wasnt a big fan of it was overly salty i ordered the burger medium rare and it came out medium well maybe they mixed it up with my friend who ordered the medium and his was kind of pink either way it was dry and the sauce kind of sucked the bread was good the iced tea was good the burger left me meh especially for a 7 burgeri will start by saying that after seeing the menu i did not have high expectations  the sushi is cheap and that is typically not a good thing    my husband and i ordered take out and were given a 25 minute pick up time  the hubby arrived and the sushi chef hadnt started making the order yet  ok fine im all for fresh sushi  it took an additional 25 minutes  hmmm     5 rollsyellowtail spicy tuna shrimp tempura spicy yellowtail and firecracker all were decent nothing great  the spicy sauce is not mixed mayo with a drop of hot sauce on topinteresting  the seaweed was not of top quality  the fish all tasted fine  tuna was very fatty  the shrimp tempura roll was the only one with real problems  it was overly fried and extremely crunchy making it hard to eat  the sushi chef appears to be inexperienced as some of the rolls were not cut properly and the ones that had seaweed on the outside as opposed to rice were falling apart  all in all not a bad place if you have a craving for sushi but dont want to spend much money  just dont expect the greatestof course the prices reflect thatthis is for the fried chicken for anyone like me who read the recent article about the best takeout at the tp website sunday noon i purchased two legs and a breast and ate them within 10 minutes so they didnt sit around this chicken managed to be greasy and dry at the same time along with tough and bland not sure what the tp writer was eating but todays batch was not worth going back to try a second timeboth times we have gone in to this subway we were not greeted or even acknowledged when we came in the door the employees looked like they hated their lives one guy in particular looked miserable and talked so quietly he was hard to understand when i got home that night i found 1 tomato on my 6 inch turkey sandwich which needed at least 2 if not 3 i tried to be nice and polite because i do realize everyone has bad days but i have never had service like that before since the employees looked miserable both times we visited im thinking it probably has something to do with management at the store there food tastes just as good as any other subway so i will probably go backgreat bagels but the egg sandwiches are not good they use a liquid egg solution and cook it in the microwave the eggs taste pretty syntheticvery good reviews and the hope of something different led me to this place i was not impressed not enough drink specials cheapest margarita they have is about 8 oz for s550 and that is their specialcmon tried the mongolian beef the spicy shirmp and the carnitas tacos all were bland dry and very uneventful the cheese dip was good but not great the atmosphere would get an a but that is about it not a bad place to hang out if you had no other optionsbut you dofirst time eating at a checkers two adults 3 kids and we needed a minute to decide what to eat the person on the drive thru was impatient when we went to pay we saw a sign for water or tea for 1 a drink we attempted to purchase more drinks but was told we had to go back through the drive thru in order to buy anything after we have already ordered the fries are awesome but the burgers are mediocre at best i dont think ill ever eat here againi really wanted to enjoy my experience here because ive heard good things about the boy scout blvd location but if i werent so hungry when i came in i probably wouldnt have eaten what i was served  first of all the hostess and front of house staff is kind of like a train wreck the hostess literally didnt say a word to us from the time we walked in to when we were seated terrible first impression   our server was obviously trying to rush us in and out as quickly as possible not only that he talked so fast that we couldnt understand what he was saying at all really ruined the relaxing part of going out to eat   my boyfriend enjoyed his bison burger i however was not satisfied at all with my meal i ordered the new steak bowl steak made to the temperature of my preference with lettuce avocado black bean salsa and rice the steak was average aside from that the food had no flavor the salsa was completely bland and the lettuce came as chunk of iceberg which has no flavor to begin with the rice also wasnt flavorful   the 199 drafts are tempting but i dont think we will returnthe family units and i decided to try hendricks because well you know bbq   we were greeted and seated quickly as they were not busy at the time we arrived   tip check in via yelp and receive a free appetizer    we did so and ordered the fried green tomatoes and the cornbread  the tomatoes were just a hair too thick which made them a bit tougher than im used to  plus they had pretty thick breading on them  taste was just ok  ive certainly had better elsewhere  the accompanying sauce had a decent flavor the cornbread is on the sweeter side and had a good flavor  albeit dry  more of an opportunity to slather on some of the honey butter that accompanied the order along with some honey chipotle sauce let me warn you now the honey chipotle is quite spicy  on to the meat   i ordered the pick three sampler at a price of 24  i chose baby backs pulled pork and brisket  lets break it down baby backs  good flavor moist good dry rub and smoke but the portion was quite skimpy 3 ribs which were no more than 2 12 inches in length  pulled pork was moist larger chunksnot shredded but again maybe a small handful portion at best  brisket was sliced thinner than it shouldve been as it lost its moisture  it had a very slight smoke ring which did not translate into much flavor  portions included 3 small slices about 56 inches in length  sides ordered were sweet potato fries and cole slaw  fries were great but the cole slaw was very bitter and inedible  perhaps some ingredients were missed  another order at the table was the pulled pork sandwich  this came with a better portion size but it was dwarfed by the huge bun and massive pile of cole slaw on top  4 sauces are on the table sweet house stl and hot  sweet  very sweet with a heavy molasses base  good flavor  house  vinegar base with a punch  stl  another vinegar base with a strong cayenne flavor  hot  i didnt even attempt this one  haha  overall id say it was overpriced for the quality and quantity received  i would pay their asking price if it was amazing bbq but i was not all that impressed  would i go back perhaps  would i go out of my way for it nomarble slab is a great concept in a unique location that could use a family friendly ice cream place but go at your own risk the teeny boppers that work there are so wrapped up in their own version of the hills drama you and your family are far down the list of folks they care about  customers are about as welcome as your parents going with you on a date   the workers and i use that term liberally are more than happy to tell you that certain ice creams are just such a pain to scoop  how very sad you know what else is a pain  paying 10 for peoples crappy attitudes  as for their tip jar seriously  heres a tip  act like someone who is paid to serve customersthere were two occasions were i didnt see people working washing their hands  both were when i sat at the bar to sit so i was there for about an hr each time  one time the cook with long greasy hair and a small trimmed beard did not wash his hands once  he continually touched the sliders by the sides i guess to make sure they were warm  but he did it with other sliders my friends thats called crosscontamination  that was one example they dont wear gloves the cooks with long hair have their hair exposed    i wrote to district about it they never responded  then i wrote a review with a picture showing the people working putting their shoes on the counter see instagram  however the review was taken down  this says a lot about the establishment  they keep their griddle clean around the kitchen but im sorry thats not enough plus its unprofessional these people obviously dont care because they have swarms of tourists visiting every weekend    if youre kitchen is exposed you have to own up  theres a number of health violations there  if you dont believe me see jenni cs report from dc  my suggestion for locals is to take your money elsewhere to other better establishments throughout the city tourists ride with cautioni was pretty disappointed got the hot and sour seafood noodle soup that was neither hot or sour the spring roll was not much better the service was good except they asked if i wanted a soda refill and then they charged me another 2 for a soda refill without telling me i guess you stick to cheesesteak in phillyim visiting from out of town and figured why not same as home food is always great but the service here was no where near friendly the first employee was great but the second was not friendly and looked bothered by my request for fresh veggies she rolled her eyes and not once smiled sad for such a great food chainugh what happened this was always my favorite food truck and wed drive an hour just for their amazing cheese curds but i just had my first order of 2018 and they have definitely changed since last fall the batter now has an overly pronounced cornmeal flavor and consistency and it really changes the crunch of the curd crust and overall taste the cheese itself seemed a bit off too there was always a mix of white and yellow cheddar curds in each order this visit all the curds were yellow cheddar and had a velveeta feel and taste to them instead of the normal rich and stringy cheddar cheese as a fan of the original version i hope this was just a temporary change of the recipe or perhaps an offdayi took the wife out last night for dinner we stood up front waiting to be seated once we got seated they took our drink order the wife decided that she would get a malibu bay breeze which was made well we ordered an appetizer combo of chicken fingers mozzarella sticks and potato skins the potato skins were horrible and you could tell were heated in the microwave we never got the bbq sauce that we asked for with the chicken when our entree came out my chicken was terrible the wifes steak was terrible and had a ton of fat on it we did get desert and my wife said that the cheesecake was incredible and the mile high boston cream pie was great all and all the floor was dirty and the food was terrible minus desertthe food was ok we ordered mac n cheese which came with a salad and another salad with steak   the service was terrible the waiter did not come to our table at all except for serving our food and asking if we were done we didnt finish our food and asked to get our food wrapped up for some reason our waiter did not include the side salad and mixed the mac n cheese with the tomato topping it came with which i took off and put on another plate what right does a waiter have to mix someones food why couldnt he just simply transfer the food from the plate to the styrofoam ughoverpriced but the food is not horrible   whats horrible is the fact that none of the food is prepared fresh they often utilize microwaves to heatup preportioned food that may have been cooked many hours or even days earlier  they have a good selection of drinks but dont expect good food theyre incredibly lazy and uncaring with that part of the businesswe arrived in st louis this morning and logged into yelp to find somewhere to eat before heading downtown we didnt have time for classic st louis bbq so when i saw angelos chicago taste i thought this is perfect im a chicago boy fresh from a trip south from home rather than order a gyro or an italian sausagebeef combo i choose a philly steak as do my wife and one of my sons   what a huge disappointment we have an original philly steak restaurant in suburban evanston near the northwestern university campus just north of chicago and i have had several meals there and those guys are from philly and know how to do it right this sandwich just doesnt measure up  the sandwich is about 6 long much less than a typical philly steaks 10 length although its tasty the restaurant tries to cover up the lack of meat and cheese with lettuce and tomato slices all for 9 for a regular size coke and small bag of fries really just because you hang some pictures of chicago landmarks on your walls dont mean you know how to do lunch chicago style guys as much a provide a good value versus the quantity you offer for a mealfood is delicious but our food took forever we waited almost 30 mins before even getting water every course after that took even longer even though we ordered when we sat down they need to staff upwhen asked if they are a stand alone store the gal had no idea  how stupid can you geti absolutely love this place the food is great and they have a great bar selection but my last visit was disappointing which normally wouldnt deter me or even get me on here to write a review i usually just email the restaurant to tell them about my experience which i did here as well the difference is they never even sent a reply email back to acknowledge my experience it will be a long time before i head back for the delicious food i went in at 2 in the afternoon for lunch on a very busy afternoon and sat at the bar by myself even though there were people waiting for tables i was only one of two people actually sitting at the bar there appeared to be only one bartender and the place was hopping the bartender acknowledged me quickly and took my drink order a lemonade this is where it got hazy he was so overwhelmed making drinks for all of the tables that after 15 minutes i still didnt have my drink and all he could do is keep looking down the bar every few minutes to let me know he realized i was still there i only had an hour to eat and at this pace i just got up and left i felt bad for the bartender because he was working hard and needed more help this review could have been avoided if my experience was acknowledged with a replyi went to get a quick carryout of queso and chips at 730pm on a thursday night they had 2 tickets hanging although they did have a full dining room i waited to get to the register only to be ignored by the girl ringing tickets when she finally got to me she said how many in your party i told her i just needed a carryout a frazzled presumably manager interrupted and told me i had to go to the bar so i go to be ignored once again when the bartender finally greets me she doesnt apologize for ignoring me or my wait only what can i get you love  i told her i just needed a chips and queso to go she says of course under her breath what is that supposed to mean anyway i watch the expediter make it and wait and wait and wait the manger asks if i have been helped yet i said just waiting on my chips and queso again i wait the bartender finally goes over and the expediter asks is that all he needs finally i get my order that should have taken less than a minute but took 24 mins  the queso was fine which is why they get 2 stars but the service is awful  update owner craig asked that i email them and they would like to speak with me personally  i emailed them and after 5 days have still received no response the bad taste i had for their service is now worsewe were vacationing in florida and someone recommended that we go to tarpon springs for a great greek dinner  i love greek food especially fresh seafood  we picked hellas based on its ratings  a mistake    the best thing we got was the cold plate appetizer  i was surprised it did not come with fresh pita but it all tasted good  we also got a salad and it was ok  hard to mess up a salad  then came the entrees our son got the squid  the menu said it was lightly coated with flour and pan fried to perfection  nope  the coating was thick and mouth coating  the squid was overcooked like rubber  i got the greek style grouper  again it was heavily battered with little seasoning  the batter like the squid was mouth coating  the fish was over cooked and greasy  greek style i suppose referred to the fact that they dumped some nasty granulated garlic not fresh over the top of the deep fried fillet  my wife got greek style scallops  i did not try them but she pronounced that the dish was like something they would serve in a nursing home  everything came with bland rice and dull overcooked peas  nothing fresh  we salvaged dinner with baklava from the attached bakery and it was goodoverpriced and commercialized are two words that come to mind i was going between 2 or 3 stars and just couldnt go higher  sorry wish i could go 34 stars but they are lacking for the reasons we go to a farm  the bad most of their products are not made on the farm and imported from other areas  that alone makes me want to give it 1 star  the apple cider doughnuts are decent but other farms close by will offer them hot and fresh out of the oven they make them early in the morning and throw them on the shelf  overall prices are pretty expensive     the good they have a fair like atmosphere that is fun for kids  i dont know of many other places that offer this  if you want to go just for this you will have a good time  we have gone picking for various vegetables and that was fun  again it feels a little commercialized but we had a good time  its located in a decent spot and parking is convienentif youve been to sylvias in harlem nyc and youre looking for a similar experience youre going to need to look elsewhere this place doesnt encompass the charm hospitality or flavor of anything southern and comforting  heres a quick breakdown  pros 1 fried chicken  winner no complaints here the batter wasnt overdone and the chicken still moist and flavorful 2 collard greens  very good but can you really ruin these 3 macn cheese  yes this was excellent my only complaint is that the portion was too small  cons 1 cornbread  the first basket was cold the second was warm and tasted better but both batches were fairly dry and the portions were small it wasnt what i was expecting at all 2 ribs  small mostly fatty drenched in bbq sauce i understand that ribs are typically drowning in sauce but these had a strong ketchup flavor and left everyone at our table unimpressed 3 price  you have to pay 1 extra for white meat and for what you pay the portions are pretty small that or id expect the quality and flavor of the meat to be much better 4 service wow the service here is horrible lets see no one ever refilled our drinks or waters we asked for lemons and straws twice only 2 straws were delivered for our table of 3 it was 30 minutes before closing time and the wait staff started clearing our table without even asking if anyone was done reaching across without even saying excuse me or even saying anything at all oh and by the way one of us was still eating when you took our side dish away  because of the service we never tried any of the desserts i really want to like this place but it seems like the inconsistencies are creating so many mixed reviews im debating giving it a second try and if things improve then ill definitely write an update heres for hopingabsolutely awful lunch buffet coordination 1145 and no pizza on the buffet its prime lunch time one server for entire restaurant plus she is the cashier and doing other things in the kitchen when the pizza arrives its delicious one of the pizza makers asked me if everything was okay now that the pizzas were on the buffet i wanted to ask if he had twice as many ready because he had hungry people who were going to scarf up the pies in two minutes this is not a isolated incident its like this all the time this restaurant needs to learn how to manage a pizza buffetnothing but late night food the pizza literally has no sauce but think doughy and i can barely get it down when im hammered can barely eat when i drunk def not coming here when im sober 4 stars my assthis spot was a disappointment went in for a sandwich and the options were quite limited i opted for the healthy bagel and it was terrible the whole thing fell apart the second i lifted it up there was barely anything on it and they served me a broken bagel the cold brew was mediocre bummerfranciscos on the river was an alright experience went on a tuesday night and wasnt very crowded the pasta was good but have tasted better werent aware of the byob policy therefore it was a very sober dinner the atmosphere was good but where we sat we could see cars headlights reflected off of the glass as they pulled in the service was good but could of been better overall it wasnt terrible but wasnt great either might be back another time just for the pasta price range was ok family of three around 100beer excellent the only reason to go here however you can only get one beer at a time even if its a 4 oz pour the waitress gave me some baloney excuse about how they dont want the beer to sit out that long if your beer goes bad that fast youve got a problem they also have a card that tells you that you should only order a pint of beer if youre really serious about drinking and they suggest you use caution if you order a pint of beer with an abv of over 7 woah a whole pint  food mediocre at best everything we had could have been better in some way it wasnt bad but it wasnt good either ceviche was just a scoop of fish sitting in vinegar street corn was overcooked crab tacos were dry burger was decent but small donut was burnt on the outside the burger came with a pint of beer look out  the waitress asked me what kind of beer i wanted how am i supposed to answer that question when you wont bring me multiple small pours  id have to sit there for two hours before i could make a decision   service below average hostess didnt say a word i dont know my servers name and it took too long to get our check she would not budge on the multiple beers thing im sure thats policy but ive never been to a restaurant especially a mediocre one and been told no for any reason whatsoever im a grown up i think i can handle two fourounce beers at once  overall this is a pretty pretentious disappointing restaurant with really good beer if youve got a bunch of tattoos a sick new haircut and like being told how much you can drink at a bar then this is the place for you otherwise get a growler to go and order a pizza or somethingmy boyfriend and i went to dinner there on a thursday night i had looked at the yelp reviews prior to coming but maintained optimistic despite the mixed reviews first and foremost  the service was fantastic our waiter was quick at getting our drinks and was very friendly the owner had made her way around to our table a few times asking how we were which i liked however the food was not close to what i expected and we left extremely disappointed we got the fried crab balls as an appetizer and they were ok at best we got the jumbo lump crab to share and when we got it  it could have easily been an appetizer there was nothing jumbo about the meat and the portion was extremely small for a 25 entree meal overall the service was great but the food was lackingi got the stuffed pepper shrimp pasta  green beans there was no stuffing in the pepper only heavily seasoned ground beef no shrimp in the pasta just 3 on top green beans were too salty ill just stick to the turkey necks been here several times and have only had 1 good plateok for a 45 minute wait at the drive through at least the food was correct and hot there was no apology for the wait time and the girl at the window was unfriendly  it took 25 minutes to get to the box to order with only 4 cars in front of me corporate needs to visit this location because service this poor is a problem within management i know the food is made to order but the max wait time for each car is 8 minutes but needs to be done by at least 3 minutes  ive worked at a steak n shake this is unacceptable what if someone has a health issue like diabetes they could be in a coma by the time they get to them ridiculous  update i went inside this time where there were maybe 3 tables sat and 3 people waiting on orders at the counter it took 25 minutes to get 2 milkshakes and out of all the employees there no one had any hustle or sense of urgency to get food out in a timely manner and i never saw a manager this location needs a lot of help i wont even mention the people ahead of me or their wait times also im surprised the cooks pants were still on since they were past his assyr so nashville if  you wait in line for an hour to eat pancakesgreat deli meats produce packaged foods eg chicken salad and candycan be a bit pricey thoughalso the management tends to be a bit unkind and standoffishthe turnover rate for employees is quite alarming as wellim only giving two stars for the awesome waitress we had  but other than that  thumbs down   my sister and i both found a long piece of black hair in our omlets my other sister had many eggshells in her eggs  my coffee cup still had lipstick stains on it which i could still wipe off  the toppings that i was supposed to have with my omlet didnt come with it  i had to ask  even though the chef offered to pay for the three messed up plates  we couldnt get over the fact that hair was in our food  yuck   the chefs need to wear gloves and the waitresses do not need to go by the food as it is cooking   sorry  but we wont be going back anytime soon the staff is nice and the food is ok for a fast food lunch  my issue there is the lack of cleanliness  the dining area is always dirty even after the line of customers is long gone  this isnt the case with mcds jimmy johns or arbys all very close byflying southwest i know not my first choice either and had one hour plus to kill in the east terminal so i sat down at pasta house as soon as i sat down the woman next to me warned me against ordering anything with grilled chicken in it she motioned towards her uneaten salad and said she couldnt cut it with a knife five minutes after i sat down one of the servers was greeting the table right  behind me just as they were sitting down when she was finished i flagged her down and told her id been sitting here for five minutes and no one waited on me she apologized and said it was toms section but that shed take care of me i ordered the penne roma no peas or mushrooms and a water everything went just fine after that and the pasta was about the same as it would have been at any pasta house restaurant my only comment would be if youre a little short on time this might not be your place thanks for waiting on me latonya 18 with tip for a small bowl of pasta and glass of water oh and no pasta house breadmy wife and i discovered this place in december and i gave it five stars i had the eggs benedict and it was the best i ever had no kidding came back this week a couple of days ago wfamily after raving about it since december discovered they only serve eggs benedict on sunday ordered two eggs over easy both eggs came overcooked but decided to come back on sunday to try eggs benedict again we ordered 3 eggs benedict after a long wait finally got our order all three benedict were way overcooked  we complained to the waitress who was awesome she immediately said shed take them off our check  very good response and great service on her part the hollandaise sauce was great  the place was packed but the chef that was there in december wasnt there a new chef  only one and a case of success being your worst enemy he clearly was and us in over his head the wait staff was awesome but someone needs to help the new cook hope they get it together  2 stars because of our waitress she was awesomechaos i went inside to order there was one man ahead of me after a minute or two the fellow said go ahead and left it was another 10 minutes before i was waited on there were two employees running the drivethru and one employee just filling orders for the walkins one of the drivethru employees was doing double duty between taking the drivethru money and taking walkin orders she was so overwhelmed why the employee just filling walkin orders couldnt take orders too i dont know i ordered a hot ham sandwich and onion rings i waited 20 minutes for my order the ham was very good but the onion rings were just burned scraps and only filled the container halfway up on top of that the employee just tossed my order on the counter and quickly left no thank you or anything like thati mean the food is good as always but the service is absolutely horrible the staff at this location is the worst staff i have ever had to deal with at any anywhere not busy at all and it takes 10 min for them to come to the window then when she does take my order she seemed mad i was there she took my order and card and in the middle of me saying thank you she shuts the window on me i would avoid this location all together only reason they get 2 stars is the food was goodfirst in the baileys family of restraunts we werent head over heels about hostesses not welcomingfriendly and for being a gourmet burger joint the burgers were just ok at best i will say that the chocolate shakes we enjoyed are among the best we have ever had anywherefor a place that only sells doughnuts and chicken i was expecting better doughnuts i did like the chicken though i would go back to try another flavor of chicken i also liked that they give you the whole wing since a lot of places have chicken wings on the menu but only give you wing dings they can keep the free doughnut that comes with the chicken though it could be just me but that doughnut is incredibly nasty and im not particularly eager to pay close the 300 for a specialty doughnut that i may or may not enjoyi guess if youve never eaten mexican food in the southwest youd be ok with this place  unfortunately i grew up in colorado and i can tell you that no respectable mexican restaurant west of the mississippi would serve up such swill  they need to hire a chef who is mexican or at least one who has eaten in the west  on the first visit i had fish tacos which were filling but not good  next visit  i dont eat meat i had shrimp fajitas  not exactly authentic mexican food but i thought theyd be safe  15 for 6 shrimp 3 small flour tortillas guac sour cream blah rice and refried beans  an 10 meal at best  my friend had the calif burrito which i can guarantee would never be tolerated in ca  we needed hot sauce to give everything flavor  if you like gringostyle mexican food this is the place for youmorning crew is pretty good they are quick and make all the drinks the correct way afternoon crew is extremely slow and always mess things up i will not be going back since i work nightsi really want to still like this place  however it has not been the same since they moved locations  i have tried it a number of times thinking it may have been growing pains but i just cant do it anymore  believe it or not i think that pho 54 is much better and cheaperway way too sweet  i am sorry but i know snow balls are all sugar but its not supposed to give you a cavity and diabetes at the same time  yes they do have a variety of flavors and flavor combinations but the sweetness factor and the prices for these premium flavors are far from worth it  plus side they are open year round so if you get a hankering for a snowball in the winter or whenever hansens is not open this may satisfy it just ask for less syrup i suppose  hansens is still the bestthe cement weedriddled fountain on the locust street curb out front this restaurant says it all  we arrived on a saturday it wasnt terribly busy  it was fairly steady with a very large childrens birthday party in the corner we sat smack dab in front of the window with a clear shot of the bar and all the wonderful art decoish paintings it might as well been the dead zone we watched no less than four staff members behind the bar checking their phones ribbing each other staring off into space and we sat and we sat unattended  then a very sweaty  to be honest it was an extremely hot day  and smelly waiter it was pungent we ordered grill veggie sandwich and a chicken salad number a raspberry soda and a coke  the food was bland and ill prepared nothing special  the dessert was indeed incredible  a brownie baked in a cup we just cant understand why people love this place it might serve as an after theatre dessert place but other than that theres little to redeem it  people seem to love the decor and frankly its just not impressive to anyone who has been outside of missouri heck outside of midtown  not recommended  spend your hardearned money elsewhere the sad neglected fountain out front says it all these people dont carei was a little disappointed in tim hortons  this review is for the doughnuts only  they do have breakfast and lunch sandwiches also  it is located in the cortex area so it is pretty dead on the weekend parking is a problem  if you can find a place on the street consider yourself lucky their parking lot is located caddycorner from the shop and is fenced in so you have a bit of a walk ahead of you    we chose the glazed maple glazed cinnamon bun  apple spiced jelly doughnut and a cherry danish  i hate to say it but we were wondering if the doughnuts at schnucks would have been better    would i go back  not for the doughnuts but i would go to try one of their lunch sandwicheswhen i found out that a panera was opening close to my house i was so excited i love panera and have for about 10 years even worked at one when i lived in florida however this location is subpar i go in the morning and id say 910 my order is wrong i dont change anything i see it on the screen i see its on my receipt but when i get handed the item its just not what i ordered i dont make a big fuss of it but there are somethings that i cant eat so i have to turn around and return it i hate looking at my food in the drive thru but now i have to because its never right i know how busy panera can get so i go at non busy times and yet i still have an issue with the service i have tried to give this panera many chances but im not sure i can anymore this last time the cashier interrupted me to talk to a coworker and closed the window of the drive thru on me speaking told me the wrong total gave me the wrong sandwich and when i came back she was adamant that she didnt even though i still had the receipt she said i should just keep the sandwich i said i couldnt because i cant eat whats on it please dont fail me panera work on your customer servicethe food is never consistently the same  i guess they must be one of the busiest locations in st louis so beware of a constant crowed and dont except to get the same quality you might get at your usual location and the internet connection is uselesssuuuuuuper overpriced  the kids love it but they arent paying 2000 to ride on a tractor and pick vegetables  this place has become a complete moneypitseems that all drinks here are made with a gas station style machine ironic for a business called the human bean  iced coffee was bitter and the chai latte was about 3x as sweet as what you would get at starbucks second star for nice friendly serviceon dec 4th went for dinner at earls in sherwood park i have not been there for awhile as it is usually too busy to get  in anyways they  have done renovations sinceso went too see and i was not impressedthey use high end materials from cultural stone to beautiful light fixtures but when u look around it is all booths just like humphrey s no privacy and no classand still noisyto start off this parking lot is a nightmare  i saw multiple near fender benders during my attempt to get served at this wendys  i was craving some chilli on a brisk fall morning and thought id run the through the drive thru and get a cup of wendys famous chilli  i went during a time at which you can usually expect places to be a little slower  the inside didnt seem to be packed but the drive thru was backed up almost nearly to the street  i attempted to patiently wait for service to get the chilli i craved however after 15 minutes of waiting there was still three cars between me and being able to place my order let alone get to the service window to get my food  the chaos in the parking lot was starting to increase as the line to the drive thru was blocking off the exit to the main road so i decided to simply turn off before being committed to the drive thru by the concrete curb that serves as a barricade between the rest of the parking lotthis anecdote well summarizes my experience  a friend and i had lunch here  when the waiter came over to the table midway through our meal and asked perfunctorily hows everything both of us replied frankly everything is very salty  a lot of people have told me that our waiter replied  well i said did you ever manage to go back to the kitchen and tell themmeh i think maybe tampa bay just doesnt have great indian food is that why theres such good reviews ive been here for the lunch buffet a few times and am just not impressed its just ok2 stars because the taste is still amazing if all you care about is how something tastes this place is great  if youre like me and appreciate customer service this place fails horribly from not being greeted having to break up the horseplay and conversations behind the counter just to ask for help in the middle of ordering two more kids come in and the girl getting my order stops to go talk to her friends another guy had to grab my cup and finish my order when i asked what flavor something was the girl tells me she cant see what im pointing at and i should read the label problem was the label was missing i asked for my receipt so i could reference my experience when i wrote them which i did and still havent heard back from frost the kid actually tells me they were out of paper and that the manager went to the store to get more its late at night and that was the excuse they gave me  we have gone here 23 times a month for about 3 years and this was by far the worst weve ever experienced i doubt well be going backwe used to love this place but not so much after tonight everything was cold the ribs were dry the portabella mushroom was tiny and they didnt even bother to include a bun in our take out order im not sure what has happened to this place but we will not be going backcoffee was very weak  might try again but perhaps would not order their coffee  also no customer experience or interaction  not even a hellostopped here for brunch with my family on the last day of our vacation to st louis the service was terrible the hostess was also the busser and the manager so she would disappear for 1015 mins at a time this is something that might work on a slower weekday morning but not on a busy saturday morning once we got a seat it took over 10 mins to get the 2 chocolate milks that i ordered for my 2 toddlers they also brought out my kids food about 15 minutes before they brought me and my husbands orders out my kids were done with their pancakes before we even received our breakfast   as for the food it was okay my omelet was nothing special my daughters blueberry pancake was still a little doughy in the middle but we didnt dare ask for a new one because it took so long to get it to begin with   the best part of the experience was the cute two block area in which this place was situated if we are back in st louis anytime soon we would probably pick another spot to stopthe place is nice and the flavors of the donuts are okay but the donut itself is bad its like eating paper or a po boy bread with sweet icing on it donuts here arent good just eye catchingbruce the guide was amazing and very informative the low rating is because the tour included only a few restaurants and the sample portions were very small for the cost of the tour i would have expected moreit really isnt anything to write home about but the hash browns were good   i think nashville has much better options like biscuit which is across the street and there you have it folks short and sweetshopping at ajs can feel like a trip to a beautiful museum  and yes you will pay for it    but what i did not expect and got was food poisoning from ajs     we have now twice picked up food from ajs fast food areapizza salad soup to take home on the weekends    and both times we have been sick for days afterwards stomach aches diarrhea gas etc   we ate at the outside patio one day a month or so ago and i went to the ladies room in the back   i noticed that an ajs employee in the stall next to me put her apron on the restroom floor while she was going   that alarmed me but i thought oh well    twice since then my husband and i have been sickened after grabbing a slice of pizza from ajs     this place is toxic do not eat fresh food from there   i will never eat their fast food againhow disgusting to be sick for days after eating at such a nice placea very small supercenter that is in what used to be the areas smallest kmart they have nothing that one would come to expect from a walmart supercenter and what they do have is crammed into to small a space this store only exists because the good folks at walmart were not allowed to build their store 210 of a mile down the road next to the river oh well so now ts has a frankenstein store that is not going to make anyone happyive been to bjs once before at cirrus park and it was excellent this exp was the worst we were all out of a family dinner and every single person didnt like their food except for one and she got deep dish rigatoni we had the sante fe salad and it left a lot to be desired the shrimp and quinoa dish was ok and thats being generous the server was semi rude and seemed like she could care less we were there im not sure what happened bc i planned the dinner and was so excited to take the fam there but i certainly wont be back the apps we got were mozz sticks and avocado rolls mozz sticks were cold cold the avocado rolls were cold and all of the avocado was brown and mushy i wouldnt waste my time or money herefood was good service wasnt great bad ventilation i smell like i spent my lunch in a dinerfood was way over priced i liked the food but ill never in my life will pay that much for a taco again that was crazy 50 was just too much for 4 tacos 2 drinks and im not an ass so i left a tip hopefully they change their prices soon good food thoughnearly the worst service at any fast food chain i have ever been to i have been to this particular chipotle three times in 2015 and two times my order was messed up the employee staffing the cash register appeared to be aloof and not interested in providing good customer service at all dont come to this chipotle during the lunch rush hour unless you are willing to wait last week i placed a to go order on the website for my entire family i paid for the order ahead of time when i arrived to pick it up i stood at the cash register for 3 minutes before being acknowledged despite chipotles advertising about being able to show up and get your order right away i was given my order bag without any thanks and then drove the 50 minutes to home this was to be a special treat for my wife who likes chipotle although we do not have one near our home upon arriving home i found that they left out both of my kids drinks and both of my kids sides with their meals i called back three times before the phone was answered and the person who answered took down my name saying she would make it right the next time i was there how does she expect the staff to remember sorry but i dont plan for there to be a next time that i visit this chipotle when there are several other choices on the north side for a good lunch or dinner 2 stars rather than 1 star because the quality of the food is greati used to live around the corner from the foodery and after yesterday i will never go there again  if you want an expensive ass 6 pack very close to what youd spend if you got the same beer at a bar old tastycakes or to spend double what you should because the prices are so high feel free to go waste your money here i walked into the foodery and asked the guy behind the counter to use his phone to call a cab my phone had died and at 11 am on a sunday cabs were not really around because i had three massive bags of groceries and i couldnt carry them all the way home well needless to say the guy said well im using the phone i offered to wait until he was done but he just said theres cabs outside all the time and turned away i had told him that i had already waited outside for 15 minutes and saw none available and he just said no cant help you horrible customer service and considering its a neighborhood spot im shocked at the total lack of class from this store owner especially considering ive been shopping there for yearsugh the only thing keeping this place from a 1star review was the food which was actually pretty darn tasty that and a nice outdoor seating area everything else about the experience was pretty mediocre the place has potential but needs several major improvements service was terrible the waitress seemed irritated with my questions about the wine list ignored our basic requests like salt and pepper water refils etc and seemed to rush us out without even offering dessert which i am pretty sure is what they are known for and what we originally came for but i guess not tonight since she couldnt be bothered i could bore you with all the nitty gritty details but i was unimpressed from start to finish plus their live music was pretty abysmal with so many similar better options in st louis dont waste your time or money at blondieseither they have the smoothest vodka ive ever tasted or the bartender forgot to add any to our drinks pretty sure it was the latter with so many great bars on mass ave we wont be back here anytime soonstandard food poor service i went with my family 5 top and we were one of 3 tables there for dinner it was memorial day our server was not only slow but her was unfriendly ive been a server so i understand a slow kitchen may not be a servers fault but he was very rude he would drop off a drink or bread and not say a word multiple times we tried to ask him for something but he ran away from our table so quickly that he didnt hear or acknowledge us the food is goodnothing so good that i would say the wait and poor service were worth it the waiter didnt even say goodby to us a bit disappointedthe blandest of the fake mexican chain restaurants even the queso was bland man i miss arizona  real mexican foodas i said service sucked ordered my food got to drive thru the girl asked what did i order thats never a good sign then i had to wait for my large sweet ice tea isnt that made first 6 people in the drive thru not sure why i had to wait for my order m i see one of the girls go up front im guessing to get the tea finally got my tea im on my way take a sip and its regular ice tea omg how hard is it to get a simple order righthostess staff was horrible  told us 45 to 1 hour wait for a party of 5 its just bbq i wasnt interested in waiting but my friend had wanted to try it so we did several visible empty tables and a closed patio on a beautiful saturday night i will say it did rain for 15 minutes earlier that day as we waited in the hostess area dodging employees rolling overflowing trash cans and food trolleys thru we noticed a table right next to the hostess stand that could fit 6 to 7 people easily it had a small gap between the 4 top and the 2 top i told the hostess we could be flexible  she didnt seem interested in seating us there as we approached the 40 minute mark she told us she could seat us ill leave it to your imagination as to where she sat us yes the same table that had been vacant the entire time our server denise   was very punctual and efficient you could tell she was very busy  the food arrived quickly it was at best ok  my ribs were dry and luke warm and the sausage was cold but tasty here is the upside the atmosphere was great the bartender that accommodated the little one with us with a very tasty shirley temple    i would go back if nothing else to see if this was the norm wont be a place i recommend or say hey we gotta go therecame here for brunch with some friends and was underwhelmed i got the egg white omelet and my friends got the cheddar and apple omelets they were both pretty bland the jam with the toast was the highlight of the meal if you are getting a bloody go for the wrangler the service was pretty slow and not super friendly i usually love this place but wont be coming back for brunchhorrible coffee experience the coffee is ok ive had better   but what is really annoying about this place is that when you walk in you have no fucking idea where or how to order you have to go searching around for a menu a cashier station etc and figure out where and how to order trust me having to figure all this out at 8 in the morning before you have had your coffee is not fun  then they take forever to give you your coffee i dont know what the guy was doing back there solving mathematical equations developing a cure for cancer masturbating because it took him at least 15 minutes to make 1 ounce of espresso are you freaking kidding me  nice lounge area with cool music playing and the obligatory coffeehouse hipster chick manning the cash register  but if you cant take my order and give me my coffee quickly you lost me  byebyespinach dip was lukewarm obviously sat out for 10 minutes before served waitress couldnt understand that i wanted raw onions on the side burger came with fried onions she got confused i understandtoo many kinds of onions waitress was not kind not enthusiastic didnt care that we were there   burger was just not very good might as well have gone to 5 guys really nothing special about the meal not worth it wont go backdecent food if you can get it in time and you get the correct order the people work hard but they are not able to keep up with the traffic and the details i have visited several times as i live very very close multiple times my order comes out incorrect and dont even bother going at 830 on a sunday morning it will take 20 minutes to get an egg on a bageltraditionally i have no issue here but my last two visits havent been great i ordered sofritas on my lunch break drive back to the office to eat i mixed it up and notice their is beff mixed in it had to drive all the way back being more careful couldve avoided thisthe restaurant is in the casino which is understandable but some more signage outside would help the place looks a bit gaudy and outdated but nice and clean   we had good service with drinks and appetizers however we got there at 7pm and it was 811pm and we still hadnt been served out entrees tables behind and in front of us were served and those people came after us we asked for the manager and told him to charge us for our drinks and apps so we could leave he then told us that or entrees were ready and he would only charge us half price it was another 10 minutes and then a different server brought them out and we just told him to pack them up to go the manager came back with the entrees packed in a bag and said they were on the house he then informed us that because my husband ordered a bonein chicken dish it takes 26 minutes to make the meal that is still the longest 26 minutes i have ever experienced   i dont believe the ambience or the food is worth the priceim kind of glad that im not the only one not singing postos praises  while there wasnt anything horribly wrong with my lunch there it really was a laclkluster experience for the pricetag the service was minimal and i got the impression that i wasnt cool enough or european enough to be there the salad and sandwich was tasty enough but just not great i was so excited reading the sammie descriptions but then the actual product just kind of fell flat  if you want a real sandwich served with a smile go to st jamesif you wish to gamble for free you will need to bring a non gambling traveler to drop you off and they find somewhere else to hang out as there is now a 10 fee to park never have i been to a casino with a parking fee and that includes some that are much nicer than this one  very few good penny slots with low minimum bets  nonsmoking is a joke as there is not enough separation between smoking and non smoking areasi probably would have given them a better score but i ordered a bacon and egg biscuit and didnt get the bacon the biscuits are soso ive had more flavorful my coffee was a little on the weak side  the young lady at the window was very nice and had a lovely smile  not sure of the exact address but they are right off the interstate and i could see the cloverdale tower with the name very busy placeavoid the steak i have eaten their twice and found several pieces of it were mainly fat or grisle one time i complained to the manager and he said it was hard for them to tell the difference when they grilled it the other meat items are more reliable although i am no fan of shredded chicken either my friend had the vegetarian bowl which looked better other ingredients looked good and were tastyburgers were good  not great  fries are ok at best but they give you a very large portion for the price although if im going to pay 7 for a burger i might as well pay 3 more at another restaurant for a burger thats great and also not a fast food burgerthe customer service we receive is good every time we go but they always seem to run out of the donuts my family wants on more than several occasions we had to drive to another dd to get what we wanted i would have assumed that a donut establishment would try to remain in stock glazed at the very least i hope this location can adjust their product amount to accommodate the demand of the communityits an ok place to grab ice cream shave ice or coffee while peoplewatching at the beach pricey ice cream is a product from working cow coffee and shave ice are somewhat generic theres an assortment of jellybelly and other candy   the place is pretty dirty yeah i know its the beach but at least wipe down the countertop tables and maybe once a day they could drag a wet mop across the floor we stopped by two nights in a row and the same sticky spot was on the floor restrooms were pretty nasty tooi honestly walked 20 minutes just to get to this place and was excited to give it a try  first i was set down at the only place they had available the balcony it was mid day and super sunny and it took them 20 minute to just come say hey and ask if id like to drink after they moved me in i ordered the hash were super yummy and my waitress was sweet id give them that i guess if you are willing to wait 60 min in line and than another 60 min inside just to eat an egg sandwich than this is the place for you maybe i just had a bad experiencecome on hoosiers boba tea is supposed to be brewed tea that is mixed with milk it should not come from a bin of powderthe food was okay the order was wrong ordered online and had it delivered there were no napkins utensils etc not happyugly yellow building  very ghetto very outofplace looking especially for this side of town how is the food to be honest we really didnt like itomg coffee machines are broken at starbucks and on mardi gras cold weekend unbelievable at least they could have put a sign at the front door stating so we were told at the register after we waited almost 25 minutes to order and no coffee gave them a 2 cause no signs posted that machine news were down and coffee is not good at all they are making drip coffee and putting a filter over your cup and pouring hot water not a great coffee as it tasted like cigarette weird flavori had very high hopes but was not at all impressed  we went for an early dinner and i was so looking forward to the chicken spedini appetizer  i ordered it right away and could not wait to try it  the presentation was extremely plain but if its delicious i can get over a marginal presentation  the taste was also very bland  the chicken was dry and just not at all what i expected    for dinner we split a st louis style pizza and it was good    the service was slow and the place was almost empty  i cannot imagine why the service was so slow  the server was polite but very inattentive and we had to ask for more water drinks etc          i doubt that i will be back any time soonwe had the renowned fish because burgers are too greasy  that was an expensive mistakeremember my review on sengyo  i just rather go there or try other sushi places for sushi instead of oh yoko  but before i get into that  first off ive ordered pork katsu as takeout twice here before  once for lunch i think it was 11 and once crazily for dinner 20something  dont get me wrong it was delicious  the pork wasnt oily and it had a nice little crunch to it  the sauce that accompanied it was amazing tasted almost like a1 sauce but better  wish they gave more  for the lunch portion there were a side of soup salad and fruit  for dinner just soup  i dont know about you but i can easily get this type of dish elsewhere for much cheaper  but then again i got it twice here only because the pork and sauce were super super good  so my boyfriend wanted to actually dine in here because of my previous takeouts and we finally did last night  we were so excited but knew it would be expensive considering how my takeout bills were already high up there  we looked at the menu and there surprisingly wasnt any one thing that was particularly eyecatching  as we sipped on our tea 5 we ended up getting tuna flower not on the menu 10ish as an appetizer as we waited some more to decide on what to get  the appetizer was pretty good  although it had a very strong wasabi taste to it and i dont really like wasabi  there were small tuna slices that were lined inside a martini glass and with wasabi  roe  tiny shreds of lettuce toppled in the middle  the tuna seemed slightly fried on the edges and tasted sweet  it was probably the best part of the dinner  i give it a 4 out of 5 stars  then i ordered a spicy chirashi don 26 and boyfriend got volcano roll 1395 and geisha roll wrapped with pink soy paper 13951495  ive never had a chirashi don but have seen plenty at other sushi restaurants  i thought perhaps it would have been similar but to my surprise a big plate not really came my way with small small portions of diced tuna salmon white fish and a spoonful of salmon roe topped on some leafy greens and less than a bowl of rice  isnt chirashi don popular for the huge slices of sashimi  the dish came with some spicy sauce but it tasted like the sauce that comes with the popular korean dish bi bim bap perhaps because the owner here is indeed korean  im not hating but i thought chirashi don would be served with something like spicy mayo or spicy wasabi type sauce  minus points  i took my chopsticks and put streaks of sauce onto the salad like the server suggested and it was okay  i can manage i thought  then i tried the volcano roll  euh how about there were only five tiny pieces  honestly it tasted like a spicy tuna roll  it didnt even have the usual baked salmon  spicy volcano sauce on top but i guess every japanese restaurant does it differently    at that point i was disappointed but still tried the geisha roll  despite the prettiness it was very plain  seriously  we had to dip it into the leftover sauce we still had from the tuna flower to make it more edible oh and sauces by the way are 1 extra    after having ordered so much we ordered two more rolls because of how small the other portions were  tigers tail roll with shrimp topped with spicy tuna 13951495 and spicy tuna roll 7  as you can see sushi rolls here are pretty damn expensive  the spicy tuna roll seemed to match the prices of normal sushi though  anyway the tigers tail roll was alright  it had more pieces than the others so that was good  the spicy tuna roll was just five small pieces but was also edible    overall dinner was disappointing and were not even picky sushi eaters  the prices were too high for small portions of almost nothing  prices are comparable to a fine dining restaurant  we wouldnt mind paying for good food but this wasnt worth it  if anything if im really craving some pork katsu ill get togo during lunch hours here but thats probably it    ps  the reason for the extra star  because the chef is incredibly nice  the server and chef checked in with us every now and then to make sure everything was okay  too bad the food wasnt up to par to usthe beer is mediocre every time i have come here the staff has been rude and inconsiderate i wish the staff would just be a bit friendlier that way i could appreciate the over priced alessaw employees eating as they served food french fries without gloves the bathroom was in disarray with the trash can dumped all over the floor a child had urinated in the play area which was cleaned after about 10 minutes of waiting and trying to keep children away all the tables were dirty they really need to step up their cleanliness and teach their employees not to put their foods or their mouths near the food while theyre workinghad looked forward to going there for something yummy unfortunately got the sticky bun which was very mediocre  and at 299 overpriced i guess anything is overpriced when it doesnt taste goodbeen to cosi a few thousand times and the signature salad is a favorite   went to this one and they tried to tell me a white dressing was the one that goes with that salad   when i told them i didnt think that was right they argued with me   seems odd that every other cosi in the world uses a different dressing   maybe they were out and just didnt feel like making another batch  it didnt taste good  and i didnt go backnice place for breakfast or lunch any time of the day  however  there was no soup in the mens or womens restroom today there was a roll of paper towels on the zinc instead of the dispenserwent out with another family and since our other option was chillis which i frequent and love i decided to go ahead and try this place out servicee was very fast which was great im assuming since it was pretty empty food was ehhhhh very mediocre ive had better guac chips and fajitas in other places dont think ill go back to any of these chainsnot terrible but not worth going backtwo stars only because the server did his best ordered the mushroom swiss burger asked for it medium and it came out well done server was great he took it back and brought me a new burger the meat tasted over processedground half the burger was cooked medium and the other half well done they must be having a problem with their grill because my friends bison burger was the samefood came out cold cappuccino was ok server was able to add smoked boudin to my farmers omelette for 4 given the other reviews i expected more service was slow im sorry i fell for a tourist trapthe bakery went downhill lately while most pastries remained of the same quality some things changed drastically and not for the best the prices doubled or tripled since  about 4 years ago the size of the pastries has gone down   i used to buy their cream horns filled with the egg white cream as the prices steadily rose the size of the cream horn shrunk what is worse the cream got so disgustingly sweet that you can see the malice behind it they are trying to make up for the tiny size with the inordinate amount of sugar in the tiny amount of cream i am never going back there againi never send food back it happened tonight with the pizza not ne on the regular menu and a friend sent back the beer cheese soup tried it before she did  after taste was like plastic im not usually picky about any of these menu items still left with a 13 tab after 2 beers and no foodstick to the basics when ordering from this location donuts coffee and baskinrobbins ice cream  i ordered a veggie egg white flatbread sandwich  half of the cheese was crusty and the other half was melted see pic so i returned to have a new one made and received one that had a different type of cheese on it a white cheese and was stone cold almost frozen absolutely unacceptable i just asked for my money back at this point   i received no apologies just a few eye rolls which i dont take personally im sure they were just irritated at the situation but a little customer service does go a long way for future referenceour waitress was great the issue was my veggie burger was not cooked they did take it off the bill but i dont plan on going backoverpriced fast food joint   skip the pretension and just go to mcdonalds down the street  i was not impressed with the service the selections or the food   only good point was the actual ice cream for dessert   so skip the more and just get some ice cream to gohad the fish tacos and mojo chicken both were mediocre not our top choice for the area did not meet my expectations  two of my daughters and i treated my mother to lunch on the patio at upland yesterday my mother is hearing impaired so we try to choose locations on the quieter side to enhance her dining experiences we also checked the menu online first to ensure a variety of salad choices as that is my mothers goto menu item my middle daughter and i visited upland for a beverage just a couple of weeks prior it was a sunday afternoon and the patio was delightful and quiet unfortunately this visit was anything but quiet or delightful  upon arrival were seated on the patio  there were other tables occupied with ladies having lunch looked close to my age young parents with a baby and others that said i was confused by the rock music blaring from the patio speakers i tried to let it go but after 10 minutes had gone by and were still challenged trying to have conversations at our table i went inside and asked the bartender only staff member i could find to please turn down the patio music as it was difficult for us to hear our own conversations he seemed agreeable but i seriously doubt the music was modified if it was it was marginal at best its not like im not a fan of def leppard but i dont want to hear it blaring at a group lunch as we perused the menu before ordering we noticed it was very different than the menu upland has posted online for lunch far fewer salad choices fewer dressing choices and fewer vegan options all of my daughters are vegans mother and i both chose the bibb salad apparently its a new salad offering with large leafy greens strawberries candied pecans and blue cheese crumbles for approximately 1100 when my salad arrived it was a shallow salad bowl with lots of large salad leaves and a meager amount of the other ingredients fortunately my mothers salad had a few more ingredients in hers and she seemed to enjoy it so i was pleased with that we did both enjoy the salad dressings we chose there are only 3 offered so not a lot of options while we were still eating our lunch our server asks if it will all be on one check and then before we were done eating casually dropped off the bill to me i really do not appreciate it when my bill is dropped off before completing a meal and also before having the dishes cleared from our table am i being rushed to pay the bill and if so why as a customer i dont appreciate feeling rushed by servers yes pet peeve of mine  i should also mention that i tried ordering the advertised monday drink special helios pale but was told they were out of it  will i return would likely only do so to pick up a carry out order of the buffalo chili as it is a favorite of my husbands  will my 20something daughters return perhaps for a beer but not for food as upland now has very limited vegan optionsthis is the second time ive come here and it will probably be the last the nachos grande barely had any cheese and it wasnt even hot they gave us the appetizer with no plates and it took almost 10 minutes to get plates from the waiter  then the food barely had any seasoning this is one of the few times i didnt even want to take leftovers homei was pretty excited to try this for the first time last night after seeing the other reviews but i left fairly disappointed though we were greeted immediately and our table for 8 was ready we opted to grab a drink at the bar as we were early and the first to arrive the bf was excited to try one of their ice cream martinis though i dont remember his choice and i ordered the le fleur a champagne cocktail with st germain and hibiscus the girl who took our drinks then proceeded to make some dessert so i assumed she told one of the other 37 people behind the bar to make them well mine was made and left at the server drink station for some server to stare at while she was eating a salad and working at the bar after about 8 minutes we got both drinks my bfs was more like a chocolate martini literally no ice cream and mine was so syrupy if thats a word i could barely fast the champagne or st germain we finally sat down and our server was great she greeted everyone brought waters went over the specials the vegetarian cuban soup was amazing i ordered the chicken salad sandwich with the dressing on the side and my bf got the thursday specialshort rib ravioli mine came out with the dressing and his was cold our server did take it off but she also never checked on any of us so my bf sat there without eating for about 20 minutes i may give it another try but not likelygreat toppings soso donuts i tried 3 cake donuts  tres leches  mango and gooey butter cake the gooey butter cake was the best  captured the desserts flavor however the cake donut foundation was dry same dryness with the other two   i like the novelty but for allaround donut quality i much prefer pharaohs and country inn donutssheesh dont forget to bring your twenties  this little food market doesnt play around  its a nice much cleaner alternative with slightly better food options than the rest of the suburban station trench warfare fried chickenmickey dspizza hut selections  with a second dibrunos la scala mexican post and a termini brothers outposts  along with a jake  max saladsoupsandwich deli sookhees producejuice bar franks phillys sandwichestokyo sushi under the c seafoodprepared foods  youd think youd be able to eat to your hearts content  if youre ready to drop about 15 buckaroos for a hohum lunch that includes a beverage i guess you can  jake and max and the mexican post are the most affordable of the bunch  but their offerings arent very appetizing  the dibrunos is just a replica of the one on 18th with a smaller selection  tokyo and under the c are pretty pricey and they too offer pretty average stuff  la scala seems to be the better of the bunch but only if youre prepared to spend a little more for their gourmet pizza entres and salads  sook hees produce is fresh and the juice bar is pretty good  theyve got a nice orange juicer and i like to treat myself every once in a while to a small one at 299  id still prefer to get my produce at sues definitely cheaper on 18th though  even with the walk  if the weather is shite and youre stranded in suburban with nowhere to go the market is a good option  it gets pretty crowded during midday lunch rush go before noon or after 130 but there are always tables available  despite all the glitz though i dont find it to be any better than what they offer at liberty place only two blocks downcrowded expensive and not well stocked watch yourself there also i have had my pocket picked there i no longer shop theredont do it just dont go sloppy decor sloppy service sloppy food my husband and i decided to try this place we ordered drinks that never appeared and had to flag down the waitress to get any service i ordered a hamburger medium and got one well done no flavor no juice apparently no seasoning the fries were pretty good skip iti do not know what is happened to this place but the service has gone completely down hill i cant tell if the kitchen really sucks or the food sits around too long before it comes to the table or everybody is in the back smoking but something is definitely off and it didnt used to be like this it was better food and servicealways took 20 minutes to get my salads during my lunch break   my store would order pizzas here regularly because it is also in la cumbre plaza it was continually sub par but the employees were always very friendly loved their chocolate chip cookies thoughfrom what i hear the tampa casino is nothing compared to the orlando one cest la vie they charge you for every drink which are overpriced the food there is pretty subpar and the amount of vip crap is annoying for a person who likes to go casually their parking is a nightmare but at least its free people always say while you gamble the casinos take care of you not true they take forever to get you drinks and when they do its 10 for a bloody mary comps only come if you spend half your paycheck and lose of course   save yourself the trip go to the beach or somethingi ordered togo earlier today half sandwich and side baked potato the food was good but the croissant was burned black all around the edges and i had to scrape it off i would order the sandwich again but ask for it not to be heated at all i ordered the potato with butter green onions and sour cream unfortunately all i got was a potato with onions no sour cream and no butter which made for a very dry side dish i ate half then threw the rest away because dry potatoes dont taste that great this place has potential but i dont like having to fix so much myself and throwing away food because basic orders cant be followed for over 11 i expected more from my dinner i wasnt even full at the endmy husband and i are frequent customers of this starbucks location because we live nearby to it we typically drink starbucks anywhere we go due to the fact that they offer the specialty coffee drinks and we run into little to no problems when ordering unfortunately at this location more often than not we have to send the drink back because its missing something we asked for this is alarming because what if someone who was ordering a specialty drink made a certain way due to health issues such as diabetes and their request for sugar free sweetener was ignored ive never ran into this issue so much at any other location that we have ordered from and hopefully the next time a barista repeats the order back they actually make it the way they are saying itthe food was pretty good however the menu is small so if you are picky i wouldnt come here the reason i only gave it two stars was because of the staff we just moved to east nashville so we are trying restaurants around the town the employees here looked at us like outsiders and barely gave us any attention they chit chatted with the tables that had people they knew and left us sitting without acknowledgement for a while they were very short with us and just not welcoming so if you are a new comer or from out of town i dont recommend this placeim not sure what we missed here judging from the other reviews but my boyfriend and i were pretty aligned with the whole weve experienced better thing for starters we were starving when we arrived here its a really small place so if you want to sit outside there are maybe four tables youre waiting we waited for maybe about 30 mins and jumped right into ordering our main course i opted for the lobster tacos and he got one of the crab specials which was pretty overpriced im all about getting a little dirty when i eat but these tacos were more like a burrito  totally overstuffed and whatever was inside so soft and mushy i know there was lobster in there but there was also another type of seafood which i couldnt put my finger on i dont know the combo just didnt sit well with me and i barely ate it was pretty disappointing its a really cute placegahi hate writing bad reviews i wanted to love this placei didnt ill start with the good first the lady working the counter is great and was perfectly polite super clean bathroom soccer on the flat screen nice latin music but not too loud relaxing environment  and now for the food i dont understand the double wrapped taco there is no point to it especially when they dont taste housemade they taste just like the ones you can by at wal mart i had the chicken mole beef and chorizo i didnt get any mole flavor with the chicken maybe it was cooked in the beef was dry the chorizo had good flavor but was too salty for my tastes it was all just too dry and the flavor just was not there i feel bad writing this review i wanted to love it ill probably go back and try other stuff but the tacos are outme and my friends went here for dessert and was very disappointed with the mile high apple pie there were too many apples and not enough crust also the crust was very soggy at the bottom i shared it with two other people and we only finished one third of it and then threw it out atleast the ice cream was good i guessdrive thru  i asked for cheese  why didnt you give me the cheese i asked for  i ordered chili  every time ive ordered chili ive gotten the hot packet of sauce with it  why not this time  i dont know  the side salad and the chili were fine  i know why get all bent out of shape just for a mistake  well i guess its just that i got my order in less than 30 seconds  so maybe they should slow down just a little bit and actually double check the order  not very hard  three line items total on my receiptwas first ones in the place at 11am when they opened ordered an appetizer it took 45 min to come out steamed mussels ordered grilled shrimp salad and shrimp were still raw and even though they were butterflied still had a nasty vein in them how gross lasagna was ice cold in middle ordered a specialty cocktail and they didnt even bother to use any garnish or even give me a straw table mates had to leave there food uneaten because they were on a 15 hour lunch break who would have thought lunch would take 2 hours when we were the first ones in the place there was just no excuse for the poor service and food we received manager did end up comping the meal after we told him how the lunch had gone i have a feeling he does that often as i talked to other people since going and they had bad experiences alsoits probably only good because this is the only asiantaiwanese place but i dont know what the hype of the braised beef noodle is because it wasnt even good the whole soup was really bland the noodles were kind of hard and had absolutely no flavor  they have a little boba section in the restaurant so thats kind of cool a lot of drink options the environment is decenti purchased my parents a groupon for a pizza and unfortunately i must report that they said it was way expensive and not good my older son stopped by their house and tried a piece and wouldnt eat a second one that says enough too badthere was so much hype around this place but it was really just okay not ground breaking but the food and atmosphere were solidfood was great but the service was absolutely unacceptable  waitress was a mess and took 45 min to get our check rightwas not impressed for such a long wait for food that was seasoned way off for breakfast food and for a bread place the muffins where dry might try again but not going out of my way some staff was rude and acted bothered to even fill the coffee others where extremely nice and helpfulmeh   the greek salad was an extreme disappointment considering it was 6  dollars it was small but more importantly really bad it seemed to be a random assortment of pizza toppings thrown together it was 80 spinach 10 feta and the rest very small amounts of onion and literally 3 small pieces of warm iceberg lettuce my advice do not offer something on your menu if youre not going to do it right the small greek pizza was pretty good but the thin crust we ordered was actually quite doughy which we both were surprised by honestly i do not plan on going backi ordered the chicken strips and a couple hours later had the worst pain ive ever felt in my stomach didnt sleep much and the pain was so bad that i was close to going to the er not sure if it was what i ate here but it was the only thing i had eaten recently and the pain started immediately after not going to any jack in the box again i dont trust that the food is sanitarymcdonalds fries are not vegetarian are not free from dairy or wheat   they also contain hydrogenated oils blah   its just odd that french fried potatoes contain wheat dairy and beef  productsi have to disclaim before posting this lame review that i love the entire lineup from river horse and especially tripel horse i buy it all the time that being said we were very disappointed driving an hour from north jersey on fathers day weekend to see that tripel horse was not available there were only 4 beers on tap 3 were ipas  pale ales and i forget the forth   the tour was your standard brewery tour but given their output i was expecting something more i bought a large growler because again i love their products and the ceramic cap chipped and broke the first time i used it i may give it a shot again but there are more breweries to seewhen they first opened it was consistently amazing but now not so much i live 400 feet away and every time we have ordered in the past few months food comes out soggy we show up on time to wait for fries so burgers get cold not sure what is missing in the process because they always have plenty of people working need to refocus on the details to make the burgers worth another trythe building is a repurposed commodities exchange from the late 1800s so if youre going for the history thats pretty cool the gift shops are well gift shops and the food is pretty average its definitely touristy but certainly not trendy   downside student tour groups tend to converge on the bourse during lunch time so it can get pretty loud and overcrowded ah to be young again  upside you can get the sightseeing tour buses and the horse and carriage rides right outside the bourse and you may run into betsy ross i did today or ben franklin   my recommendation for those visiting philly consider the bourse a pitstop but not a destinationthis place has fallen off big time once they changed owners about a year ago everything went down hill for them  the service is not good and food is a big two thumbs down   cuban sandwich well thats what they call it practically a ham  cheese sandwich  there was no pork on the sandwich they need to step their game up if they want to lastwhat can you say about beignets and coffee if you mess that up the place should close two stars for piss poor customer service word to the wise dont take someones order and walk away midway to pack up another order for a customer unbelievablenot that good low quality typical beach joint steam bucket only half full shrimp over cooked service is averagemcdonalds of pizza minus the dollar menu but if you got 5 and want pizza might as well  its a step up from a hot pocketfirst time coming here and the crew was kind of rude they got confused on which one was the pizza bbq chicken and the 2 topper they got upset because they had to remake it the pizza had very light toppings very unhappy with the service herei was already a bit disappointed after the move but now it seems the amazon takeover has had an effect and not for the positive yes they lowered a few prices temporarily who knows but i notice a lot of empty shelves examples no oatmeal in the bulk section no baguettes at all yesterday half empty milk section and a generally understocked appearance perhaps this is amazons way of trying to stock just the minimum but theyre not even doing that also the rewards program is not nearly as good as it once was maybe these are growing pains but so far not impressedthe service was good  the beer was warm  the food was not good  given the other reviews im hopeful that my experience was unusual but i had trouble finding anything i was excited about on their menu so if i return itll be to give their beers another chance  their growler selection is the best ive seen so im hopeful the beer redeems itselfi have only had takeout from here  it wasnt that good and i didnt think it was very authentic  overall it was just mediocre  edible but not outstanding  if youre in king of prussia and you want indian food i suggest you shop around  there are a lot of choices much better than jaipurwhat kind of a mexicanthemed restaurant doesnt have quesadillas answer chipotle i have visited this restaurant three times for tacos and burritos but they dont have a quesadilla on the menu once i asked for it and a couple of employees thought over it asked each other and said they could make it but it will only have meat and cheese and will cost the same as a burrito i wasnt willing to pay 7 for a quesadilla with just a little meat and cheese any other toppings would cost extra not fair if youre looking for warm food like quesadilla or fajitas this is not the right kind of mexican restaurant for you i also feel that the employee at the register should put in some napkins and utensils in the carryout bag i often forget to stop and get some on my way out because at almost every other restaurant not chipotle they always put some napkins and utensils in only once i got bad service at this restaurant it was late evening around 9pm and the employee preparing my tacos kept talking to another employee the entire time that is rude if you are going to talk the entire time over my food with your coworker and it was just some casual chitchaton fat tuesday you have a staff of 5 are you serious  you are on one of the most popular corner poydras and st charles day of mardi gras and you dont properly staff your location come on starbucks they have one person on the register and on guy who looks like he is trying to look busy so he doesnt have to do work this is ridiculous   the staff is moving slow as turtles no smiles no hi how are you heads down they have one door open and the line is out if the door the only good thing was i got bathroom tickets do betterspecifically chose the good cup because we wanted somewhere that was open later where we could sit and work for the evening upon our arrival we stood by the register and were not acknowledged for what seemed like forever when the red headed barista finally took out order she was totally rude the hours online say they close at 8 pm but she acted like she was inconvenienced by our presence though the place was full of people youd think having business would be a good thing but instead we were urged out with a loud and grumpy announcement of closing time every 5 min   our coffee and tea were delicious as always too bad the service was so horrible today well be back but well make sure we call ahead and ask about closing time first in order to avoid the inhospitable baristaweve tried quite a few sushi places in the west and south county areas all of the food we had was very good herenice complex flavors all of their rolls were comparably priced to other places if you want to fill up and not spend way too much get quite a few of their hand rolls and veggie rolls 4  however we were at the restaurant for 130 hours we didnt get our food for well over an hour and ate it pretty quickly after being so hungry there were four total couples in the restaurant and a couple of carryout orders being worked on it looked as though there was only one chef present and everyones meals were coming out very slowly after finishing we were ignored the waitress was all around us doing other things cleaning tables checking on other people etc it  was quite obvious that we were finished for quite some time the manager came by early on and apologized for the long wait  before anyone dismisses this as me being hard to please thats far from the truth i always give people the benefit of the doubt and never complain about meals or ask to see managers and i didnt do that this time either i eat it even if its bad still tip appropriately for less than good service and go on my way  the whole point of this is if the service was bad i could possibly see around it and return if the food was slow same thingbut not both if im looking for a variety of rolls and a decent place to eat them there are other options out therei saw a article in the rgj and decided to go there for lunch  very nice staff odd mix of customers young and old and normal decor for most places now being built exposed hvac not much attention to detail  the counter seemed inviting for a single diner but behind the counter looked completely disorganized lots of stuff no one would normally even leave on their counter at home mostly in disarray  asked a question about the blt bacon being pre cooked but was assured the bacon was great  30 minutes later the sandwich arrived probably the worst blt i have ever eaten hard cold bacon small portion basically a lousy sandwich  i had also ordered soup which was good and a side salad which was marginal  left the business after spending 14 including the tip hungry lunch is my main meal of the day  i think this place has potential but they need to get rid of the blt offering and concentrate on providing satisfying portions for people who are not complete vegans or health addicts  good luckdont expect to get any work done here  despite a lovely remodel of the bicycle store that was here along with a good sized parking lot there is quite literally not a single table in the entire joint with an electrical outlet  no plugging in your phone computer nothing  sat here for tea which was fine for 20 minutes didnt even unpack my stuff i wont be backfirst i would like to say that i went into this with an open mind and decent expectations my first impression of the place was it was dingy for being open less than a year there was not much seating and the back and countertops of their work stations were cluttered and needed a good wipe down   next when it came to ordering it was simple you choose which ice cream flavor you want and get to add toppings i chose the tropical storm vanilla peach mango and pineapple with the same ingredients plus banana as toppings the process was really cool to watch and that is how the hype all started    once we got back to the car to eat i was disappointed when i realized it was canned fruit and not fresh fruit my friends cookie monster also came with only one cookie in it the ice cream flavor wasnt that outstanding either to be honest this place is definitely overhypedhard to rate  sushi good maybe great miso great  pad thai not so much  either this place cant make pad thai or every other thai place i have ever eaten cant make pad thai  the noodles were bright pink  i am pretty sure that they stir fried noodles in the red sauce from the chinese sweet and sour chicken  it made a dish that i am calling chinese sweet and nasty noodles    order the sushii noticed as we entered the restaurant wasnt busy i expected it to be cleaner after we ordered and got our drinks we made our way to a table had to wipe salt and a few frys from the table the food was ready quickly  i  love the frys however these were so over salted and i mean over salted we were unable to finish the fish was way too greasy once again i was let down may have to start going to a different locationthe vegtable cream cheese was good large chunks of real crunchy vegtables but the bagel was everything short of spectacular considering there are not many bagel places in the area i guess this place will have to dojust ate a burger from there about 15 minutes ago had the 500 burger ordered it medium got home and was about to take a bite and i look at the patty and the thing is pretty much raw now i can understand it being a bit undercooked but this thing was no where near medium very disappointing had to cook it up and dirty a pan at home didnt taste any seasonings  had the truffle fries as well while the flavor was great but there was nothing but beat up fries in my bag boooooo ill prob go back and give them one more shot but the first impression is not very goodrestaurant appeared very clean and staff was polite and helpful   i ordered a falafel sandwich and it tasted like the fried shrimp they serve because they fry them in the same oil this was most unfortunate  this is a fast food place and mainly thrives on selling wings and other fried up american fare im a little disappointed at yelp for recommending it to me when i searched for falafelthis place used to be great  i am guessing an owner or two ago their prices were great and their food was fantastic  now they are just another sandwich place in south philly  my wife daughter and i have ordered there for years  we would always get one of their little pizzas and a couple of sandwiches  unfortunately they dont offer the pizzas anymore  my 2 year old daughter loved their pizza but since they dont offer it anymore we just order city pizza all the time if she wants pizzaoh and they dont have pizza rolls anymore either  the sandwiches also seem to have gone down in quality  i always try something new but each sandwich tasted like it was the same dry meat on bread combo  sorry amatos but until you go back to lower prices and higher quality this guy is just going to support the other local jointsif youre looking for a late night snackpizza joint look no further axis is the perfect place to stop by after a night of going out or hanging out being one of the very few restaurants that open late nearby penns campus axis is a solid choice even better they open and deliver 247  however dont expect much from the quality of their food my friends and i ordered a medium pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks the pizza was bland and all the topping fells off after taking the slice the mozzarella sticks were hard and cheese definitely did not melt in your mouth as you would expect them to   despite this axis is such a great option or probably the only option that actually delivers late nights but due to its convenient location within the ucity area ill give it another tryi am completely unimpressed for starters we ordered the smoked onion rings which turned out to be overly breaded grease sponges that both my wife and i found to be inedible next our burgers arrived and i was little surprised at the tiny morsel that was brought to me as big around as a coffee cup and on a soggy bun it was cooked well but come on 11 really  i think the concept of this place is good and the menu of items is interesting enough but the execution is lacking the dining area seemed a little dingy and not very clean with a lack of attention to detail like the big chip out of my salad bowl the wilting flowers on our table and exposed bus tubs at the entrance on a positive note the cucumber boozy lemonade9wow was pretty darn goodi dont get why this place is so popular i have been here three times and will never go back the food is nowhere near as good as some other options in town athens blue fig or even fattoush cafe and the service ive received has always been subpar  when i first went to kalamatas i was surprised at how it worked you go in order at a counter and then get your own plastic silverware and napkins and pick a seat the food is served on styrofoam plates and your drinks are served in styrofoam this seems like laziness on the restaurants part there are no real waiters to speak of so if something is wrong you have to take it back to the counterwhere ive had to wait in line just to get a wrong order fixed  the food itself is okay im not blown away by anything ive had on their menu a couple of times ive ordered the hummus with pita bread which is a big mistake the hummus tastes about as fresh as the athenos stuff in the supermarket and the pita bread is served cold why it takes so little time to heat up pita bread yet another problem that just seems like laziness on the restaurants part  ultimately  my biggest problem with kalamatas is the fact that i can get the same meal on plates with real silverware and receive actual service at a couple other restaurants in nashville for the same price i think that for my dollar here i should have gotten a lot more than i didupdate 62312  so weve been to tortugas twice in the last year  the first time i had a nice big black chest hair fingers crossed lets hope it was a chest hair in my taco  that kept me from wanting to eat there for a looooong time  then we just went back recently and sat down in the restaurant  the food was great hot tasted fresh i cant complain at all about the food  the server was another story  we handed her a coupon and she had an attitude and a tone with us stating that it had to be called in and would take a few minutes  then she walked off leaving us standing at the register until someone else came and took care of us  listen tortugas coupons are incentives that get peoples behinds in your seats we dont want to deal with attitude problems just because we have a coupon that you have to do some extra overhead for  after such a great meal we left the restaurant talking about the rudeness of the server  thats a shame  see you in another year i guess tortugas  update  6511  i cant bring myself to eat here anymore  the place does not seem clean  the last time i was there i found a hair in my tacoa hair  a big greasy hair  its a shame because tortugas has some things going for it in the food department  however with other choices quickly springing up around it tortugas needs to get with the program before ill ever go back there if ever  for now even though its been months since i ate there i think about finding that hair every time i think about tortugas  and seriously tortugas do something about your debit card purchasing system its pathetic  you have to pay money to do debit  original review  ive always liked tortugas they are okay  i really enjoy their chicken tacos and the nacho chips that come with the orders are really very good    they are not a great place to order take out from its better to go there and eat  when i order the chicken tacos to go i find that they are very water logged when i get them home and the once crispy shell falls apart right in my hands  generous amounts of chips and salsa are given and that is always appreciated  i do agree that they are overpriced though    they really need to update their debit card system or something it always takes longer than usual when im paying with a card and i think they even have a surcharge for using a cardnot sure if cafe  or apple store  when you walk by and look inside you see a row of people by the window and almost everyone is using a macbook  wow did i really try to pull off a meme in a yelp review  consistent with previous reviews that have complained about service this caf is hipsterunfortunately the snobby and arrogant type of hipster  coffee is above average but why people rave about storemade french press baffles me  althogh it does taste better because it is made to order french press is the frickin easiest way to make your own coffee at homeill start by saying that im not a coffee buff but i certainly enjoy a nice cup of coffee i have to say that i wasnt wowed by the cafe mocha or the americano that ive had from there but id still go back to grab  go because its in my neighborhood  grab and go is the way to go in my opinion last time i stopped in there were at least two dogs sitting obediently by their owners who were on their laptops and it was pretty full i was never really the type to linger in a coffee shop alone though  i noticed the set of rules posted by the milk and sugar  they really made me feel welcome very inviting set of rules appreciative of their customers they arewhats up with quality here really bad i got a small mac n cheese and it was cold salad box was half full  seriously like 12 cup of salad and 2 tiny wedges of tomato greek not up to quality of other panera s maybe they are a victim of own success they are swamped at lunch  which could explain the poor quality maybe check out sub depot or pie 5  more lunch restaurants are opening in the area time to try themsandwiches are great i had the best damned turkey 6 with a small fry and a pint of ipa  without checking price on the beerthe waitress while efficient and pleasant suggested another beer  sure i said  so 1500 worth of beer later i was presented with a 2400 bill  before tip  2800 and change for lunch  good food but this is not the place you want to come for beersit was hard to give 2 stars  the location is beautiful  very quaint and bright  workers are very pleasant and helpful  i had a large party and the staff were extremely accomodating  my issue is with the food itself  i have to say tasty but   i had ordered the high tea for one  i was expecting the traditional look of high tea with 3 tiers  what i got was a plate with 5 little finger sandwiches a scone with lemon curd and clotted cream and a slice of cake cut in 2  sandwiches were kind of tasty but the fillings were extremely stingy  scone was lovely as well as the lemon curd and clotted cream  the soup was a tomato basil and was very tasty but entirely too chunky for the portion  it was more of a marinara in consistency  i was disturbed to see into the kitchen and see them preparing their vegetable cheese soup and the cheese soup was actually a sauce by ragu  the desserts were a gyp  it was billed to be 2 cakes and chocolates  no chocolates and it was one slice of store bought loaf cake cut into 2 pieces    the meal was tasty dont get me wrong it was just disappointing  final noteif you have allergies to certain foods in the finger sandwiches they have a strict no substitutions policyspent a nice evening there with friends the white sangria was goos and so was the very small portion of pea tortellini pasta the appetizers we had the crispy artichoke and the charcoal octopus were good but way tooooo salty same with the pizzas the margarita was better than the burrata but both we too saltythe service kills me here it is horrible delivery orders take well over an hour and a half every time i am seated with my 6 and 8 year old we are ignored for 30 minutes until someone brings us water typically our last 3 trips have taken us well over an hour to an hour and half just to get our food and that doesnt count all the time to close the bill the only reason we come here is because they have a good salad and the kids love pizza so we meet half way next time not making the same mistake ill eat my salad at home and go to a parlor where we arent ignored granted the kids love the pizza but the service makes me think digorno is a better choicei remember when i first discovered flying cupcake  it was the highlight of my day if i checked facebook and saw that cookie dough was a flavor of the day  that is until the day i met the chocolate ganache cupcake  sadly that was about 6 years ago and things have changed  prices have gone up inflation i get it but quality has gone down  my most recent encounter was with the salted caramel chocolate which sounded like a match made in heaven sadly it was not  the frosting had a weird sticky consistency and the cake was dry until you got to the middle which was filled with caramel  this experience isnt very different from others ive had but the number of locations and their food truck is why i keep trying theyre everywhereevery time i come to this location is a different disappointment sometimes they dont have mocha who runs out of mocha in a coffee place plus their coffee at this location is watery compared to others i may just stop coming here altogetheryou know this is a pretty cool place and they work efficiently  if the line gets long an employee comes out and takes orders from the line via remote tablet like at in and out   ive had drinks here twice now one was a black coffee and the other was an americano my reason for only two stars is that they serve their drinks kinda weak  make them stronger and its a 5star placei eat a lot of fast food and this is not a top choice the automated order machine was broken and it couldnt accept cash for payment so to the long line i go like my previous visit the order was wrong on more than one item including a no tomato burger having a big juicy red slice   the order had taken nearly 15 minutes to be prepared and the two of us came during non peak hours we swear never to returnthird time to fermateria im really trying to like it the only reason im giving them 2 stars is because the beer is very good    this was the first time i was seated at a table that wasnt in the bar area it took over 15 mins for our server to stop by the table she didnt introduce herself but asked if we needed more time really  i dont need more than 15 mins to figure out that there isnt much i would bother ordering from the menu i got the kale and egg salad which was totally bland i waited 10 mins to flag someone for salt and pepper to add some flavor then it took 5 more mins to get it there were plenty of empty tables so  not sure what the problem was other than our server was never around and rarely checked in on us it took over an hour to get a kale salad and for my dining partner to get his burger    the original tired hands has been more attentive in general and at least they have really good bread and cheese   i hope they work the kinks out because it is a really nice space and i really want it to be a successi want to first state that i was extremely happy to have this supermarket in town however lately the overall state of this store has recently let me down the concept of having a kiosk for ordering deli items is perfect but the system does not work the first thing i do is place my order and do my shopping mind you with a 2 year old then go pick it up and check out the past few times i have done this and my order has not been ready i get they are busy obviously that is why i use the kiosk  then when i ask about my order they act like how dare i bother them recently i got a response that they where understaffed and busy but really 30 minutes they would never make a person standing there wait that long i take my time shopping due mostly to the fact i have a freakin toddler anyway they just do not have a sense of urgency or even employees that care to be efficient i truly hope that this store does not continue to let me down because overall there products and prices are goodthere are a lot of places to grab coffee in broad ripple and many of them are warm inviting spaces that make you want to stay this place really isnt that it is cramped and has a lot going on i had a smoothie my first time and a tea my second both were just okay what really gets me are all of the signs that say outlets are for paying customers only theres just something about which i find off putting about that not really a place i want to meet someonenot terrible just not good  steak was pretty skinny cut ordered medium came super welldone roadkill and was overseasoned albeit acceptable  potato baked was standard fare and pretty hard to screw up  salad was not fresh and mostlyall iceberg with a sad little bit of tomato  glad i tried it seen this place for years and curious about it  will not order from againmy mom loves their steak salad here so here is my review after 2 visits  they do make a decent breakfast here  everything seemed fresh but just standard fare with nothing really worth raving about  on my second visit i made a crucial mistake and ordered the meatloaf  obviously frozen it was sadly served with a thick gelatinous brown gravy and instant mashed potatoes  i wasnt able to finish it  a stouffers tv dinner is better  really  so if you are satisfied with just heated frozen entrees you make like this place  if i get talked into coming back ill stick with the breakfast side of the menutourist trap the fudge tastes good and they give you samples the employees were very pushy they asked us 3 times to buy their buy 3 get 1 free combo our cashier visibly changed his attitude the last time we declined we felt like we had done something wrong and got drawn into a conversation over why 2 people didnt need 2lbs of fudge when we looked at the bill he charged us over 20 for one half pound slice of fudge when he had quoted us 1099 for a half poundafter raving about how wonderful acme oyster house on iberville st was to our friends we were very disappointed in the food at the harrahs location  we arrived in nola mid afternoon on monday and were just too hungry to wait in the line  excited to see that they had another location in harrahs so we went there  very very disappointed  my shrimp po boy was one of the worst ive ever had  if a restaurant is going to have multiple branches the owners should make sure the food is up to the primary locations standardsthe dirtiest starbucks ive ever been in they do seem super busy so hoping that they were just understaffed todaywalked in waited for customer service not greeted had questions the clerk were busy to busy for customersit pains me to write this review  1 because i have experienced the original sylvias and really wanted it to be similar 2 because i want this place to work and become amazing for the neighborhood its in 3 because other yelpers seem to have had way better food experiences than we did   a little background  i stopped in for lunch with a friend yesterday    the place looks fantastic is modern bright and airy  i was greeted by the gentleman behind the counter in the catering area  he was very nice   i head around the corner and find my friend who has a table   the server comes over and we order two iced teas and an order of fried green tomatoes to start   they come out pretty quickly and are very tasty  this was the highlight of our meal   our server is unfortunately very frazzled  jazmin was her name  very friendly but literally for an hour and a half all we had was apologies  the place wasnt busy yet so i couldnt understand why she was so flustered the whole time   we were friendly  courteous as we were really there to try it and catch up   she told us a basket of corn bread would be out soon   we each ordered the fried chicken  white pieces  it consisted of a breast and thigh  my sides  greens  mashed potatoes my friends sides  mashed potatoes and lima beans  the plates arrive after awhile  no cornbread we ask for it  she says she will be right back   we dive into the mashed potatoes at the same time  one bite that was it  they werent piping hot and they were very dry  they def needed more butter or cream  neither of us went back to them   i then tried my greens which were decent  not soggy and still a little firm but a good flavor   we then tried the chicken which looked amazing   the batter had zero flavor  no spices no salt  i have never in my life put salt on fried chicken but that is what we had to do  it pained me do so when my friend said publix makes better fried chicken that was actually true and saddened me   we both picked at it a bit  the cornbread the never came   our glasses were never refilled  when we asked she would apologize and we would still wait another 15 minutes  i really cant believe how she ran in 20 directions when she was only working a couple tables   when we were ready we asked for the bill and it was brought to us in like 20 seconds  we both put our credit cards down and another 20 minutes waiting to check out  we had to call her back over to ring them up  another flustered apology   so it seems she was having a bad day  it happens it didnt ruin our day but the food and lack of service really need to change to bring me back in  i would rather cross the bridge to south tampa to loves for fried chicken than have lackluster taste  please sylvia  consider the reviews and vamp it up a bit    i want to come back and i want to love it  we shall seei love the taste of baskin robins ice cream but i cannot get over the rude staff at this location if youre in a bad mood  need ice cream to cheer you up do not go here the employees rudeness will make your mood even worse your money will buy you ice cream here definitely not customer servicefood was ok  couldnt get our appetizer out until after our meal then it was wrong  no manager around and nothing but sorry  wont be returningcute little place nice atmosphere i ordered a grilled pork vermicelli and the noodles were cold no brownie points there the pork and flavor were on point though overall i wasnt impressedbeautiful setting but way overpriced for average mexican food meat was dry and bland miguels taco bus and poblanos are all better the servers were quite friendly however my husbands drink order was incorrect as well as an entree ingredientwe went for first time today at 5pm  1st host sat us down and nobody came for 15min as i asked a waiter to be our waiter we were seen talking to him when he was rushed off and told that shes got this then left to get a waitress who finally came to rush our order out of us then disappered again we were just about to get up when our drinks came so we said lets see how this goes  apps good  salads good cesaer great johnny ok steak good but chicken dry  soup minastrone good but cold and waitress didnt have cheese then disapeared again we also had italian trio good   so lets see food good but not handled correctly we got our check before we were asked if we were finished or wanted desert witch we did so when we said something to her she just said sorry so we just said forget it then she dissapeared for 20 min this time really never got a refill yet so when we asked for teas to go she came and refilled our table glasses really however now we were laughing   wait staff needs to be retrained or fired    that said will i go back   yes but not untill i read better reviews on yelp yepnot quite what i expected especially seeing the long lines to get in every weekend i ordered swedish and potato pancakes and both were as good as a box mix at best food came out to quick maybe they had been sitting for awhile just sayinnote to jordyn its not very welcoming to address someone when they walk up with what do you want a smile and warm welcome will take you far in lifethe french press anacapa location hand craftedbrewed coffee took less than 5 minutes and turned to be a bad one sorry guys but when you offer and ethiopian hand crafted coffee from a fancy pipe at market price i can only expect a great cup instead a got a very weak one even the color was off i dont know if the barista used the wrong proportions or that is their style i will never know because not going back i was just visiting sb and needed coffee that coffee  1 croissant 930  i though that was too much tooisnt it  after this i went to try another relatively new place and that was plain drip coffee but a lot betteryeah its really pretty bad the folks who work there are nice on the whole so im giving it a second star  ive been going here for years since my time in school unless youre willing to walk to 10th street this is one of your few grocery store options in the area spruce mart on 1516th and um spruce is decent enough but thats really a big corner storebodega dibruno brothers is excellent but up on chestnut and 18th and more of a specialty item storenot where you get your cereal and 2 milk theres sues for produce also up 18th but they just sell produce so in the end youre stuck with the shttenhouse as i like to call it  the produce here is poor to bad and they make little effort to make it even look fresh the green leafy veggies are often wilted brown and withered and the fruit either way to early to put out or more often a bit rotted here and there   its been a long time since ive bought meats there i probably wouldnt either  and so not a huge selection very poor produce and an extremely high price point for what you get makes this place a bad choice unless you have no other option which i guess is how they stay in business avoid it if you can get what you want somewhere else and its convenient to youim really disappointed with this franchise krispy kreme ive noticed that if you forget to tell them fresh donuts youll get day old or two day old donuts you know theyre old when the icing is invisible and the donut looks plastic i bought 3 dozen for work and they were happy at the thought and alot of them said well we just pop them in the microwave no absolutely not i paid full price for supposedly fresh donuts and you shouldnt have to pop them in the microwave always request fresh made i hate i didnt look at them before i left but you shouldnt have to this was the second time this has happened and i thought id leave a review this time so disappointed if youre going to sell old donuts at least discount them first not sure if ill go back to this locationdefinitely a nashville institution and everyone who comes to town wants to go there me i just dont get it   there are plenty of pancakes to choose from ive tried several different varieties and never finished a whole platethe coffee is pretty poor considering fido is just down the street bacon last time i was there was a little too crisp ie burnt oh and ive always had a pretty inattentive waitress  the line seriously the food inside is not worth waiting for go once when theres no line just to say youve beenas average as any subpar bbq place nothing worth mention honestly everything drenched in sauce which means your covering up something  fried chicken was decentbut how do you screw that up not a surprise this place always looks empty its the equivalent to a hardees that serves bbq what a wasted locationwell this is certainly one of the better subways in the area  very nice and helpful staff the dining area was glean and well kept  i ordered my  usual roasted chicken sandwich topped with nearly everything under the sun  but like ive written a few times before tucsons restaurant scene is just a little bit too great for any fast food spot to shine  from fine dining to sandwich shops as well as some of the greatest mexican food in the world there are just too many wonderful choices to warrant choosing to spend money on another small bland meal from a billion dollar chain restaurant with nothing special to offer   i dont know that ill ever visit another subway if i can help it  and this was one of my best experiences eating at onethe mamas really good spaghetti and meatballs pasta was not really good hardly any sauce and the sauce was really boringthis place looks like a real bagel place but those hard round things were not real bagels  no complaints about the service or the pricesbelow average 12 cheeseburger small and underseasoned california blt probably decent but kitchen cheaped out and used the butt end of the loaf of bread out of first 3 beer choices i selected will not returnthe other reviews seem to say it all the food just isnt that great  not to mention i came down with a terrible stomachache after eating here  but if you like your indian food good and greasy  youre in the right placethe good the food is delicious and nobody does juices better  the bad you might find yourself waiting awhile for your order and you might find that your order is missing things that you paid a premium for but by then youre so hungry you forgot about it and devoured the whole thing before you realized what was missing  they ugly they dont track their ingredients well so its basically impossible to order gluten free they also must use something else im not aware im allergic to because i have literally never left there without a major gastrointestinal reaction its not a pathogen because my husband can eat the same thing i do and be fine its sad but i think my animo days are over at least until they do a thorough and transparent ingredient audit and start labeling allergens on the menu boardbeing new to the area i dont know about many places so im always excited to try a new venue  i was here during the happy hrs of 57pm i ordered the mango martini which was actually goodthe peach wasnt that great  being broke i opted for the half off appetizer specials coconut shrimp chicken wings catfish tenders cornbread  for some reason all the items tasted not fresh the shrimp was chewytasted like precooked shrimps that were then fried in the coconut batter def did not taste like it was made fresh when i ordered it  cornbreaddef not freshly madetasted like yesterdays cornbread  basically everything i ate was not freshly made  i understand that i was eating on the half off special but geez ive ate at other places with half off menus and the food were freshly made and delicious  anyway i was not impressed i expected something way betteroh well onto my next venue they had a parking lot right next door which i was very excited to see its a large place and i liked the decorhopefully they improve on the quality of the foodi love this place and every time i have friends or family come to visit i always bring them here my last stop in i was disappointed to see that they had taken their turkey options off of the menu if pork and beef are not in your diet your menu options are extremely limited especially if you would like an amazing croquenut slightly bummed about the menu change and disappointed that it changed to appeal to a smaller dietary groupi was not very impressed for starters since when is tzatziki made with sour cream the rice pilaf tasted like it was minute rice and the vegetables were seconds away from being pureed if you dont know what real greek tastes like youll like this placetook the family to get lunch after ordering and waiting for the food through the drivethrough i looked at the receipt found that they had added a bread that i did not order i confronted them about the additional bread and they had no answers it seems as though they added this in hopes that we did not recognize its on the receipt was very concerning that maybe we were not the only ones that were overcharged for something we did not order as i had all the kids in the car and we did not have time to stick around to figure out why they charged 75 more we told them that this was unacceptable and told them that i would report this on yelp so watch your receipts  it seemed like a good scam that most would not catch when we got home i found that i did not even get that chips that were supposed to be my sidegenerally speaking i am a big fan of whole foods but this visit left a sour taste in my mouth  so i wasnt too thrilled with my initial visit to clay terrace but i figured if there would be any saving grace to that place it would be the whole foods right  wrong  the set up of this store is pretty similar to any other whole foods  the selection prices etc all of that was the same  here are the things that bothered me  1 free samples who doesnt love free samples  it would have been nice if they had toothpicksutensils to eat them  and some of that stuff looked like it had been sitting there for hours  2 cashiers generally speaking i think this is where whole foods and trader joes really differentiates themselves from other grocery stores  as we approached the cash registers 3 of them were open but didnt have anyone working them  evidently all of them were having a rousing conversation at the third persons station    when we finally managed to get the attention of one of them we got down to business  after my wife had paid the cashier handed her the receipt but began takling to the bagger who showed up after the fact about an order she needed processed  my wife stood there not sure if she needed to sign or if she was all good  the bagger actually had to ask the cashier if we were good to go to which she replied a hasty oh yeah    overall whole foods you really let me down on this one  i didnt knock you too hard but i dont think ill be coming to this location anytime soon  celebrity rating sheryl crownot impressed  ordered delivery took over an hour to get here ordered a green smoothie they forgot it the restaurant did call me to inform me of this after the order had already left 20 minutes ago and they did refund me which was generousbut still what was the point of ordering it at all ordered the veggie sandwich on multigrain toast came on ciabatta ordered extra avocado definitely didnt have it and on a 9 sandwich i just wish i had gotten what i had ordered long story short dont think ill be ordering from here again oh wellhave done a lot of shoppig there at lunch time cause its near my office   effective yesterday i will no longer patronize this store   i found out that this store does not participate in the redeem points for gas program for use at giant gas stations   i can do same shop at giants in trooper or  or limerick on my way home and redeem some points  also yesterday i stupidly did not pick up the 20 at the self check out that i had requested  a few seconds after i realized i had not i ran back  the person who checked out immediately after me took it   i know its my fault but when i reported it to management they said nothing they could do  so i gave them my contact information in the event that the person who took it might turn it in all they could say was good luck with that one      since the person behind me had also requested cash back i thought maybe they didnt realize they took an extra 20 and might return it  i think based on their credit card information the management would be able to identify and contact them and ask but they would not   since over the years i have spent 1000s of  there and since they basically blew me off plus no redeem points program i am done with themthe food was good not going to lie about that and for a fair price only reason why it got 2 stars as long as i dont catch something from the people handling our food with their bare hands without washing once   not to mention two times ive been here had very rude wait staff that seemed like the last thing they wanted to do at this moment was take my order and bring my food once may be a mistake happening 2 times is a problem there will not be a third time maybe eventually they will stop neglecting us and serve us our food so we can eat go and never come back    my tip is to the people cooking food in the back pretty disgusted that person handling all the raw food and stuff going into my mouth is not wearing any gloves and didnt see her wash her hands once wont come here again dont want to risk getting me and my family sick the health inspector should pay this place a visitim shocked at the good reviews here service was good the staff is very nice i can eat dried out chicken at home very bland overpriced not enough parking wont be backperhaps my friend and i are too much of a traditionalist but the vietnamese  japanese and mexican fusion wasnt happening for us  the seaweed wrap made the sushi burrito chewy and difficult to bite into the tuna was cut into big chunks so it made us feel like we were biting into a hunk of raw fish  we also had a rice bowl that was good but not good enough for me to want to order it again  i was really hoping to love it here and surprise my boyfriend with a sushi burrito at his job nearby but i didnt want to take the chance and order him one and he not like it either   oh well it was a unique experience with good company  all the ingredients were very fresh and the restraurant was cleani wanted to like this place  i live less than a mile away and for months ive watched the construction with anticipation when i heard it was a blakes i researched them on the interwebs and got even more excited i was so excited in fact that on opening day i arrived before they opened and was the third person in drivethru on a side note the trash folks arrived right after me and couldnt get to the dumpster so we all had to move out of their way let them do their job then go back in place  for this getting to know you phase i ordered a bacon breakfast burrito a southwest burrito with red sauce and a lotaburger with no addins despite being the third person in drivethru it took quite a bit to get my food but i figured it was due to just opening i took the food home and cut it in half so my teenager and i could try it all the bacon burrito wasjust okay the hash browns were a big white mush and the green chiles were too hot for me i had to pick them out teenager agreed except the chiles were fine for him i took one bite of the southwest burrito and actually yelped my mouth was instantly on fire they should warn people about the red chile sauce because it was way way too hot my lips and tongue were throbbing and i couldnt eat any more of it teenager liked the burrito except he said it was too small for the price the lotaburger thankfully i didnt put chiles on it was just okay it was like a poor hybrid of a whataburger and an innout burger and neither of us were overly impressed  sooverall my impressions were just okay but the chiles were too hot while teenager thought it was just okay but too many onions used  a week later we gave it another shot we arrived late in the afternoon and were smart enough to park in the adjoining church parking lot right behind the bus stop interestingly there werent any people in line to order but there were many people waiting for food  this time we ordered chicken strips the grilled chicken sandwich regular fries seasoned fries and onion rings to go it took forever to get our food for most of our wait there were several other people waiting for their food and one of the crew members kept telling us to move out of the way heres a tipif too many people are in the waymaybe get the food out faster the kitchen was full of people so i dont know what the deal was with getting food out  anyway our order finally arrived and we took it home like before we divided everything in half so we could sample it all  once again the food was just okay the chicken strips seemed small and were nothing special the bun on the grilled chicken sandwich was a sodden mess because of the mayolike sauce they used it fell apart quickly and both of us wound up just eating the grilled chicken and leaving the rest of the sandwich the fries were  just okaynothing special the seasoned fries werent very seasoned and the onion rings were decent but too greasy  so to recap in our two visits we tried  a lotaburger a bacon breakfast burrito a southwest breakfast burrito a chicken sandwich chicken strips french fries seasoned fries onion rings  the overwhelming result nothing outright sucked except for that wet bun but none of it was really good it was just one big meh add the intolerable wait and this is one place we wont be revisiting anytime soon  im so disappointed  psmy mom texted this morning and said she was the second person in drive thru at 621am and she didnt get her food until 639am she too said the burrito was just okay and shed not planning to go back eitheri recently ordered the pork chops and was very disappointed with the meal  there was more fat on the plate than meat  the flavor was fine but not very appetizing with all the fat left on the meat   my wife ordered a veggie pita and not much flavor   we were there a few weeks earlier and ordered the lamb kebob dinner and thought it was too spicy and just didnt like the flavor im not sure if well go back but running out of greek places in the areaif you are desperate for a casino i guess this place will do  my biggest problem with this place  it reeks of stale smoke throughout the casino  ive been in lots of casinos all around the country and this is one is bad  i couldnt take it after a while  then they spray some kind of deodorant product that makes it even worse  ugh  there are lots of games that they dont have here  craps roulette etc  unless you count the electronic versions i dont  there are lots of slot machines but not enought of the cutting edge new and fresh machines  i dont personally think they pay all that well but that is just my experience and i may have had a bad day  we were there on a wednesday night after dinner and the table miniumums were pretty high  i saw a few 15 min but most were 25  oh  and no free drinks on the gambling floor  after an evening i pretty much had my fill of this place for the foreseeable futurewas in the area and never been so stoped in glad i got this one off my list had nothing i would go back formy husband purchased a breakfast sandwich combo worange juice for me and i was so sorry afterwards the food was very greasy and not even hot it was lukewarm for the most part and not one napkin was in the bag i like the one here in fernley where the food is always hot and delicious and they give you lots of napkins and the drive thru for the most part is pretty quickjust ok describes the food here  not amazing not awful  probably why it doesnt seem to be busy  id rank the food below the other chains like qdoba chipotle etc  brisket is ok  verde chicken special taco was not good  bought 3 donuts and we didnt even get through them because they had no flavor    it serves beer which is nice  nothing special  the food isnt good enough where were dying to go backim always getting menus from chinese restaurants and pizzerias but when you have your standbys its not easy for a new place to catch your eye the menu for queen came this week and i wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection they have the usual veggie and bean curd aka tofu entrees but they also have mock chicken beef and duck we actually ordered carryout the same day i read the menu  i was excited  the food was okay but i have to admit it was disappointing part of me wants to try another few dishes but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable   first up  moo shu vegetables i usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce and this had the bonus of including broccoli baby corn and mushrooms but the pancakes were dry stuck together and inedible the corn tasted like a can not great  next vegetarian beef with mixed vegetables the beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan where the stuff still tastes like flour the sauce was good but the dish was unremarkable   finally we ordered one of the chefs specialties  bean curd with general tsos sauce the silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky sugary sauce and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside very disappointing  no spice no heat and just sugar and fat for appeal   the two star rating means ive had better my absolute favorite is wild ginger in huntingdon valley and i also prefer china garden inn in willow grove i was hoping for a good take out place closer to home but this isnt itwhen our order was called out we couldnt understand the person yelling that had little to do with her heavy accent but very much to do with how fast and mumbled it was then when i didnt understand her she gave me a dirty look thanks i ordered a ham egg and cheese sandwich i received said sandwich minus the cheese you got 33 of that incredibly difficult sandwich recipe wrong how  also not sure if they normally toast the english muffin or if they forgot that too but they are crazy if they think people want an untoasted english muffin on there sandwich their hash browns were also gross and soggy and i ended up throwing them out   the only reason this isnt a one star is because our drinks were made very well and the woman that took our order was very politefood is great but the service stinks  i came to pick up my food and the lady seemed like she didnt want to be bothered and had a nasty a attitude   customer service stinks wont be ordering from there againbathroom out of toilet paper bar tender was rude when i notified her over priced under flavored under portioned tacos one day i hope to find a taco shop in tennessee that at least competes with the places where i grew up in california this is definitely not itif i was only rating on my dish it would be one star for me i am doing a round of whole 30 and wanted to give this place a shot after asking the server what she recommended she said the seared tuna it was 27 way more than i would normally pay for a meal but i was just so thrilled to have someone else cook for me unfortunately i was served a big plate of disappointment the avocado stuffed peppers were bland and my tuna was not edible it has a very thick dry crust on it the flavor profile was very overwhelming i had a half of a piece and stopped there i was so sad to spend so much money on a meal i couldnt enjoy the other food options looked good but ill stick to cooking at home during my whole 30 roundtook my living social to catavinos on saturday and was greeted by the owner telling me i needed a reservation i looked around and no oneno one was in the shoppe it was 345 and she told us that the tastings didnt start until 400 we waited until 400 and one of the employees saw us and asked if wed been helped we told her we were there for a wine tasting she apoligized and sat us and we did the tasting she was very nice but my first impression stunk i bought 3 bottles of wine but most likely wont go back because the owner has terriblecan i repeat terrible customer servicedont even think of using the mens restroom consistently dirty disgusting toilet paper on the floor last time one toilet overflowing with sh spoke to the manager he thought it was ok and he had no budget to fix even the run down toilet seat this was the second time i brought disgusting conditions to the managers attention wrote an email to corporate twice got form letters in return they said the manager would get back to me guess what he didntthey mess up my order every time i call one in they need to focus less on speed of service and more on accuracyi went here a couple years ago and thought it was pretty bad  the waiter was obnoxious and the food was subpar  i came back only because i had a 50 off groupon  the waitress this time was equally as obnoxious talking loudly on the phone and hollering across the restaurant to the other waitress about taking a cigarette break  the menu has a great selection normally my favorite new orleans dishes  however they fail on execution  the shrimp crawfish and tasso pasta had tiny frozen shrimp which is totally unacceptable at 14 and at a place called saltwater grill in new orleans  the fried shrimp poboy was mediocre but doesnt nearly compete with other uptown poboy shops  if youre looking for a similar menu at similar prices but much better food and relatively good service try ignatius on magazinei want to like this place i really really do but i have been disappointed every time i go in i live very close by and its really nice to have a place to go to when youre in a pinch in the middle of a recipe and realize you forgot something however many items are very overpriced also they dont carry things i thought for sure they would have i wanted to get some whole wheat buns they have to have that right i mean they sell veggie burger patties wouldnt they have buns to go with it no they only have loaves of bread perhaps i was missing something but no one there is particularly interested in helping customers every time i go i say im never going back there but of course i find myself going back and giving them another chance and another chance the strength of this place is that it is the only grocery store in the immediate area for that reason im very happy to have this in the neighborhood i would never do an actual shopping trip here i would end up spending 2 to 3 times as much there as i would elsewhere i was behind a man in line who paid 100 for a couple boxes of veggie patties and some produce i couldnt believe it when they told him his total overall i dont think this is a terrible place i just wish the prices were a little reasonable and they carried more things ive often stopped in here to find something and then had to walk to whole foods when they didnt have it so i often wonder whats the pointi was pretty excited that a jimmy johns finally opened in plant city the first time i came here everything happened as normal the sandwich was totally on par   my second visit though was a bit awkward i walked in with my small group and the only three workers in the building were having a very involved conversation and not acknowledging any of the customers we stood there for a few minutes but it eventually became clear that we were waiting in vain so we leftsalad was great the breadsticks were undercooked their counter service was a little wankisome of the young woman working here are awesome great attitudes helpful the young man seemed inconvienanced but he was doing five jobs i think they need a bit better process they got backlogged quickly trying but maybe a little helpthe cake was not pretty when it was deliveredthe chocolate shavings all shifted to one side so it was really ugly on the other sidethe cake also didnt have a cardboardholder thingy at the bottomso my friend had to blow the candle with the cake in the box since we couldnt take out the cake to hold easily the chocolate plate with writing on it costed an extra 4 and broke before i even got to my friends place i did not shake the box overall it just wasnt what i had in mineat first i liked it a lot now i go there and have to wait way too long for just coffee and a muffin early in the morning only one person waiting on you doing everything so you wait why she rings them up and then get their things ready after waiting in line it was 4 minutes after 10 and she said i could not get breakfast even though i was there waiting my turn not very friendly and customer service not goodi went here for the first time today with my 4 year old son and left very disappointed the food was fantastic but the following 3 things left me reeling bad service price and food portion we went on a sunday afternoon with around 10 other patrons in the whole restaurant our waitress was so slow rarely even checked on us and had an attitude i spent 30 on myself and a kids meal and the portions looked like they came out of ice cream scoops including the frickin meat i will not be returning here if you want great bbq for a good price that will fill you up try lil mickeys bbq in st petersfrenchness guaranteed well this could mean anything from expensive food to rude service   what i might forgive sitting in a parisian cafe is not so oohlala in a cafe facing a supermarket parking lot in tucson our cheap sidewalk table tipped we moved someone parked and the windshield glare bored into my eyeballs   the much heralded eggs provencal were tasteless  not at all worth the wait my moms coffee was lukewarmfirst cup and refill   the wild divergence in reviews for ghinis should have been my first clue cest la vie but never againso i may just be the odd man out but each time i have been here something bad happens  first time there they spilled water all over me  they were trying to be fancy and pushed the water glass across the table but it hit something fell and water went in my lap  they did apologize but still  this place is sooo loud inside  im 27 and it was loud as hell  i could not here the people i was with    i got the potato and pickle soup and it was the most disgusting thing i have ever ate in my life  the worker noticed i did not like it as i only ate about 2 to 3 bites out of a bowl   he laughed and said its a specific taste and not for everyone  but he did not offer to do anything about it    the ice cream is over priced and you can get better quality at dairy queen  if your younger than 30 you should not go heregreat location   wouldnt let you sit out on the patio with pups coffee was pretty bad for what i tried maybe theyll come around eventually and i can give it another shot   youre in dunedin like 98 of places here are dog friendlythe quality of the product is good im giving 2 stars because the customer service is so crappy ive been in on several occasions over the past year and 910 times the staff have been rude or too busy talking to each other on their phones etcgot a wonderful burger on a soggy white wonder breadtype bundidnt taste like any brioche ive ever had very disappointingconvenient location cramped and dangerous parking lot comprehensive selectionwith no prices listed arranged haphazardly in cramped aisles with no one in sight to help you find anything drove over an hour on the basis of their websites assertion of in stock on a highly rated seasonal once  a year beerupon arrival was informed itll be in next week and we only get four cases anyway so we sell it by a lotterybut the website saidi just work here im  not the ownerand i just shop here and will never be backi went on a sunday morning with my wife and daughter  place was busy wait was only 10 minutes so not bad  you had better hope you get a booth  we were sat at an undersized table which barely had enough room for the food  it was so crowded i was hit 2 times by the tub the busboy was carrying  i can tell how the crowd is turned over so quick  the bulk of the food is prepared ahead of time  the wife had waffles and bacon  waffles were good but bacon had been sitting for a while  i had eggs benedict  home fries were good  eggs done nicely english muffins hadnt been thoroughly cooked  the sauce was a whole different story  absolutely horrible  looked like someone had melted butter and thrown some spice in it one plus is the wait staff was friendly i left my tip on the table and when paying the check i was asked if i was leaving a tip on the card i said no and got a dirty look and snide remark had read the reviews on here and my wife had been there before  we will not be backwas hoping for a better experience but ill give them another try next time im in the area because i prefer to support local coffee shops i really want to like this place  first off good luck finding the shop i knew exactly where it was supposed to be based on gps but i overlooked the place twice due to poor signage and ended up driving around that same building twice and then wandered further around to a different section of westhaven before finally seeing a sign for it  i feel the drink menu coffee and espresso is a little limited they do have different food options including baked goods biscuits and even ice cream it was after i had ordered and paid for my mocha that i found the muffins wrapped and stored on a centerpiece server on the middle of the big table where patrons were sitting so i went back and grabbed one and paid separately my mocha was on par the muffin was just not very appetizing the service was fine but they didnt go out of their way to smile or make you feel welcomed  oh yeah my lid came off my drink twice but fortunately it did not result in a major spill i had trouble getting the lid to fit on my cup  they also have tea and coffee by the bag for sale as well as gifts  the place is beautiful and rustic on the inside im hoping next time i have a chance to stop in that i can upgrade my reviewnot so impressed nice facilities but staff wasnt super friendly or helpful asked for a wake up call  didnt get one they sent someone up to bang on our door  try to use a key to get in no idea it was a hotel employee thought someone drunk was at wrong room lots  lots of smokers everywhere  no nonsmoking casino areabeen wanting to try this place for a while but waited for it to be open a little bit to work out the kinks of a new restaurant  went right before the lunch rush on a thursday  line was pretty short and moved along pretty fast with plenty of open tables     they have an abundance of meats and sides and i ordered the brisket with an addon of sausage and for sides collards smoked jalapenos and fried pickles and it came with a biscuit  all of it looked good but in the end it was meh since my entire entree was basically luke warm almost cold which was surprising since i watched them take out a fresh brisket and i got the first slices but surprisingly it was not hot not even warm  the brisket albeit room temp was good  the sausage wasnt anything special but still good  as for the sides collards good but nothing to get excited over  they do use ham hock but its missing some more salt and some of the vinegar tang to it  the smoked jalapenos are stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon which sounds amazing but this is the type of side that needs to be fresh  it def had a great taste and probably would be amazing if it had just come out of the oven  the fried pickles had the potential to be amazing they use thick cut round garlic pickles my fav but then they just put way too much breading on them that if you ate them with the breading you lost the taste of the pickle  finally the biscuit  it look good its a heavy dense kind not light and flaky at all and i commented on if it was hot that butter and honey would be amazing on it but alas it was not hot and there was no butter to be found though didnt see honey    so all in all it was just okay  it has the potential to be great but with everything being luke warm and mostly bland it just turned me off  there are other bbq places around that are just as good so im not sure ill be backdefinitely dont come here without the intention of staying for a couple of hours  this place has won awards for their beer but definitely not the service we waited for about 20 minutes without anyone in front of us and had 1 sample we really wanted to buy a couple of growlers for a cookout but i guess well just have to stick with buying cans at other retailersits a combined taco bell  kfc which is a plus  however the staff at this location apparently cant be bothered to clean the lobby despite the fact that the place was almost completely empty at the time i visited there wasnt a clean table in the restaurantfirst the wrap was quite good it was the service and the attitude i did not like  it is total self serve  they yell out when your drink is done so you have to listen until it is ready the come get it  then you have to come get your wrap when it is ready  but when you pay with a credit card it prompts you for a tip  a tip for what  i had to find my own table  i had to go to the counter to order  i have to go back to the counter twice to get my order  they couldnt even combine my chai and my wrap into one trip  arrogant and greedy asking for a tip  wont be backi really wanted to like this place the store is absolutely adorable the store looks like something i dreamed up in kindergarten when i thought the world was still made up of pink frosting and glitter this is a good thing  the staff was wonderful as well they were quick to give me recommendations and very knowledgeable about ingredients   butthe cupcakes were some of the worst i had ever tasted i was very excited about this place so a coworker and i grabbed a sampling of about every cupcake in order to pick favorites for a future larger order every cupcake was extremely dry and lacking flavor except for the overall flavor of sugar sugar sugar my coworkers all agreed and i felt a little embarrassed for pushing fc so hard   i again wanted to like this place so much so i went back for a solo order and expected the same thing   perhaps they can play around with some new recipesflying cupcake you are so cute i just want to like youthe food doesnt match the prices the donuts look delicious but honestly were really just okay i wont be returningmac cheese crab appetizer was unusual we think we liked it burger had stale bread salads were pretty good very open sterile and cold excellent black ice teafood was good  waitress was ok  manager is a pud  after ordering an ipa i was brought a glass that was half foam  waitress said it would settle  ten minutes later asked to get it topped off after it settled to half a pour and still had an inch and a half head   she was afraid to ask the bartender no exaggeration  clearly nervous  asked to see a manager and she said he was the manager  me not afraid went to the bar and asked for a topoff  met with a condescending smirk to which i asked is there a problem if youre a pud to me ill be a pud to you  after a few pleasantries i walked away with a full beer  ordered my next one in a bottle for obvious reasons  all over probably three ounces of beer  just give me a full pour and not make me wait 15 minutes for the suds to go down  any other place would have replaced it immediatelyi ordered the grown up griiled cheese todayroasted pork with provided cheese on italian bread the pork tasted like dirty grill and was very greasy my husband had the chipolte brisket steak he said it was ok the bread fell apart and the brisket was in big chunksi have driven past blakes in deming nm on my way out of hatch so many times and always thought to myself huh i really should try them out but i never do because i just want to get home to tucson and to be honest 9 times out of 10 i just put a sparkys green chile cheeseburger in my belly so i wasnt hungry when blakes came to tucson i was really excited  dont believe the hype the green chile cheeseburger at blakes is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile the green chile is delicious but not very hot at least for my taste but thats not where i find fault with this burger the actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger mine was thrown together so sloppily that i had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it i literally had to put my burger back together before i could eat it and then the grease started dripping off my hands honestly i would compare the burger part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher we also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not the size of the order of onion rings for the price was not a bargain at all  so im glad i finally tried blakes but i really dont think ill be back especially when the green chile double cheeseburger i had at whataburger was actually better but then again my judgement on that one may have been clouded by a hangovermore like 25   i want to like this place  my kiwi pear carrot wheat grass juice drink was goodjust not 12 good i get that its doylestown and healthy but that sort of price point precludes repeat business    ditch the corny lab coatsthis is part of the gold course so it was a very dead atmosphere when we went for dinner the service was terribly slow it was known for burgers and shakes both were so rich and gross i could not eat them sadly i would have preferred regular fast food the shuttle system is extremely slow so make sure you take your rental car or prepare for a long walkthe juices are good i would skip the rest very erratic ive tried everything burritossalads and its never the same as the time before  its almost like they are winging it each time they make something  not cheap by any stretch and anything added is extra  no hot sauce out but they have some they make which is nasty consistently the people who work there are generally rude and seem irritated to be there and there are always a lot of people working i really want to like this place as i am often in the area for business and would love a quick place for something differenti come here for breakfast alot  the egg  scrapple melted with cheese on a croissant is sooo delicious and only 375   however for as many times as ive been in here ive now been triggered to write a review  i actually bought a sandwhich for lunch usually i have salad and its ok but my chicken sandwhich on croissant was quite dissappointing  for 8 i got cold chicken on an untoasted croissant and the cheese wasnt even melted  i was expecting a warm grilled chicken on a toasted warm croissant and that is not the case  if the chicken is going to be served cold then it should say so on the menu  like everyone knows cobb salad has cold chicken  but a oven roasted chicken sandwhich as its quoted on the menu should be warm  soups are ok i sampled a few and they were ok  not bad but not good enough to make me buy some  i tried the veggie potato leek and some kind of lentil curry soup    i will not spend my lunch money here  only breakfast    on another note the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere with new booths tables and upstairs seating is really nicethe salad bar has gone down hill  only 4 salad dressings1 in the bottle from the shelf  dirty salad bar and dining tables  no forks  1 salt shaker no pepper i generally shop here so i can get a great lunch guess not  and i hope the kid cleaning the sneeze guards didnt spray cleaner on the lettucesive been twice few years ago  the food is average to me  i saw the groupon deal so i thought why not give them another chance nothing has changed my boyfriend ate half of our food to save room for the dessert  we had cowboy burger and turkey burger we left half of each burger and a plate of fries food still so so our server was very nice except when we asked for to go box he took the food away and never came back with our left over technically a whole meal a burger and fries    we found out he threw it away  at this point i paid for food that just get throw away luckily i used groupon so i didnt pay that much but still its my food  i walked away with no leftover that i was looking forward to eat next day   ps as you can see below the manager contacted me i contacted him back but never heard from him i thought at least i will get a free dessert or a burger as their apology  nothing no respondmy boyfriend my friend and i went here late last night around midnight we were just looking for a spot to have a nightcap and talk this place was perfect for that there were a lot i people at the bar but no one in the seating areas so we sat off to the side near a window looking out onto 116th street  thats when the trouble began our waitress amanda was rude and seemed to be bothered by our very existence she never really greeted us just put menus down and asked what we wanted we ordered a round of shots which took 10 minutes for her to bring we ordered beers and my friend asked for an orange slice with hers it took at least 15 minutes for her to bring the beers and she tells my friend were out of oranges for the night no apology etc she then comes by about 1245 to tell u the kitchen is closing and to take our menus she doesnt ask if we need anythingher entire attitude was off putting she doesnt come back by until 10 after 1 when she tells us that its last call i asked what time they closed because the website says 3 and thats what had brought us there she stated that theres not a set closing time weird but ok she brought the check out immediately and sort of hovered and stares at us until we paid it she then takes the cash and goes outside to smoke before bringing the change she walked by and just laid the change on the table without saying anything   im not sure if amanda didnt care for us because we didnt sit at the bar or if it was because my friend was black or if she just hates customers in general ive never felt more unwelcome in an establishment  my boyfriend did talk to the bartender who was apologetic and gave him a free shot my suggestion is to sit at the bar and avoid the waitress stick to beer as they have a great tap list reasonably priced but the liquor is a bit pricey the shots of petron silver we had were 950 eachi will start by saying this food would be really goodit clearly is good quality i ordered takeout and it was just so cold that it made the meal unejoyable whenever i order takeout i make sure to get there 5 minutes early in order to prevent taking home cold food because im not eating it right away i want to at least take it home immediately when i arrived it wasnt ready yet which was fine i waited and waited and my pickup time came and went i waited some more and others orders kept getting called out to be pickedup finally i went to the register and asked them to check on my food the bartender reached behind him and grabbed a bag that had been sitting there for at least 15 minutes and said oh it must have just came up now i was taking home food that had already sat around when i had gotten there early to prevent just that   i was very disappointed by this i would suggest if you are going to eat there dont do takeout dine in for surewe have been there twice and will not return the good both times service was great surprising their sides are really good the bad tiny portions very dry meat over salty ribs and all of their sauces are super watery not a good sign for bbq place without great meat and sauces if they guys want to survive they need to change their portions address the super dry meat over salted ribs and come up with better saucesmy thai ice cream was delicious but may i point out how bad of a customer service i received that sunday i went no customers were in there the employee did not greet my husband and i as if we interrupted his time from his phone i had asked a question and he replied with a attitude as if i was annoying him i asked because it was my first time having thai style ice cream then as he handed me my ice cream i said thank you he didnt reply or even looked up at me so rude i def regret tipping him will never return to establishment what sucked was we dont even live in philly but still went since i was craving for thai style ice creamthe most stupid supermarket that takes advantage of its proximity to center city and its monopoly as a fullfledged market in order to sell overpriced and expired foods pretty much every single thing is over priced while still being of terrible quality since its been sitting on the shelf for too long  bought canned peppers and used it once and a week later it was bad   ive been guilty of running in here when in dire need of something but i try to avoid it as much as possiblethis chain is normally one of our favorites last night for our anniversary dinner not so much service benjamin was totally lacking almost awkward to be honest cheese steak egg rolls our favorites were overcooked and extra greasy   waited for drink refills for a long time   chicken was overcooked and it tasted like they needed to change the shortening in the fryers old taste potatoes were cold  they did get me new ones my wife said her food was just ok dessert was lackluster  100 later we left feeling disappointed we love the iron hill hope tonight was just an off nightso being a employee at a burger joint i wanted to try 500 degrees ive been hearing rave reviews about their burgers and food going in for the first time i was amazed by the many options the menu held i went in for a bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos i was greeted by a not so friendly cashier who seemed to also be the manger being my first time i thought he would have helped me understand their system of ordering better but he was sarcastic and rude   other than the lack of hospitality i will say the food was okay the fries banana shake and the cola w cane sugar was amazing the burger on the other hand was very dry and lacked any type of flavor that i would expect from a burger first looking at it i thought it might be a great homemade burger but boy was i wrong   overall dont expect amazing hospitality from them if you do order a burger make sure you add some type of sauce everything else was pretty good and i like that they have plenty of options to choose from   im giving 500 degree 2 stars just for the lack of hospitality and acknowledging the fact that i was a 1st time guest also for the dryness of the burger the main attraction of a burger jointi always liked cracked barrel  but today was the worst  wait time to give your name so they can get a table  ready 15minutes we get seated and wait 20 to 30 just to get our food we ordered took our waitress 15 minutes just to come to our table to apologize for the wait time we finally get our plates and one was warm and the other was coldthey take the plate back to kitchen and replace the pancakes and rest were put in a microwavelets just say the eggssausage and bacon was rubberthursday night at 7pm shouldnt be too bad right nope 25 minutes so far in the drive thur two cars still ahead of me and its not like i can just leave love del taco but you are turning into taco bell with this crapwe had been wanting to stop in since they opened the place was almost empty at 900pm on a saturday night not a good sign we decided to stay to have a beer and an appetizer reuben egg rolls were good beer was good but too pricy for draught in my opinion atmosphere is horrible this restaurant is across the street from the winthrope community which has amazing food and service establishments and can not compete when sub par service is provided i will not be back again i can get better food and service at eats across the streetcompletely over rated small selection of donuts with toppings and they didnt taste that greatthe fried rice is a decent deal if youre really hungry a huge plate for 8 its a really convenient location so people go here typical iv food place 2 stars say meh ive experienced betterwe visited this establishment last sunday and it was very busy  we had a large party 4 adults  4 children and they were able to accommodate our party within a reasonable time  we didnt wait more than 20 minutes for a table  pretty good start  the hostess was friendly and smiled and let us know that the wait wasnt horrible and offered us menus to look at while we waited  the rest of the staff seemed friendly and it appeared managers were table touching to make sure the guest experience was good  its from here that things started to go downhill  first off the seating in the dining room is very cramped at least where we were led  the tables were close together and the place was stuffed with people  it was difficult to move our party to the seats and even more difficult to use the facilities and eventually leave  especially with a car seat and three little ones in tow  if you have small children car seats wheelchairs etc  ask to sit in the area where you enter the most space to move about is there  the food came out slow  almost an hour  the hash browns were cold  the bacon was limp with one nearraw  and we had specifically asked for crisp bacon when we ordered  we were missing a glass of milk  we were short silverware napkins and syrup  we had three orders of pancakes on the table with no syrup  odd for a pancake house  my wife and i each had eggs benedict  very average  one of the poached eggs was overcooked and the other was under cooked  i tried a little of everything on the table  from omelets to biscuits and gravy to pancakes  and it was all very very average  i was excited and happy to see another breakfast spot pop up close to the house but we wont be returning  for our money well go somewhere else or simply eat at homei just want to start by saying that i used to love this pizza place so its not like im crazy   i ordered over the phone for a delivery the lady who i spoke with took 15 minutes to make an order of 1 pizza and a pepsi i felt like she was falling asleep while we were on the phone and i had to repeat myself like 4 times   she gave the wrong address to the delivery guy he told my husband that it was a miracle he was actually in the right place so good job delivery guy    the pizza for some reason it looked and tasted old i have nothing against frozen pizza ive never had one but it looked and tasted like i would imagine a frozen pizza looks and tastes   i dont know what happened really we were looking forward all week to get pizza from this place but ended up being a disappointmentso i love donuts and i love coffeebut dont go here if you have a specific donut in mind they usually have a ton of iced sprinkled donuts in a ridiculous amount of colors but beyond that good luck also the coffee is a hit or miss at this location i am a frequent visitor here because bellevue doesnt have a whole lot going on but dont go with high expectationsive visited this location several times and each time i return i ask myself why this particular location is the most inconsistent in service appearance and quality as a franchised restaurant management hq and employees need to pay attention  customer service greet your customer with friendliness say please and thank you those words go a long way if its an inconvenience to tend to customers youre in the the wrong line of work  the line staff need to work together to make production consistent  efficient and accurate appearance omg wipe down the tables designate an employee to monitor the dining area keep tables clear pick up or sweep crumbs from the floor this visit i witnessed an employee walk past and over 2 napkins that were on the floor if the dining area looks like crap what does the food prep area look like food ive had lukewarm burrito bowls  cold tacospay attention  ive given this location so many chancesmaybe if the franchisee noticed slow sales numbers theyd reconsider who to put in place in management of their investmentwait staff was polite pleasant and efficient  food was ok not great  clam chowder like a can of progresso    ambiance was zero but could still be ok like a crab house on themaryland shore that specializes in their food not the environment  went there to check out a place to take guests after a tour of the historical sights but this is not the place  worst thing was the mismatch of the prices with the overall experience  for those prices i would have expected waiters in tuxes with linen napkins over their armsour first visit and we were disappointed mostly  im italian so i look for good italian markets and got super excited  i admit it is an experience going from room to room section to section selecting goodies  ill go from best to worst cause we bought a lot  the cheese we bought while the selection was not plentiful was very goodenjoyable albeit pricey  the freshmade pizza tasted really good but the crust is just too thick and hard to chew and they dont put cooking instructions on the pizza which they should  bought the marinara sauce i make better so i wont do that again it was too sweet like school cafeteria sauce  bought my fave italian pastries sfogliatella the clam shaped multi layer pastry and cannolis  the sfogliatella was passable but nothing like what it should be  the cannolis were just awful and a huge disappointment  absolutely not even close to authentic the cream was too thick the shell not fresh just didnt taste right at all have never thrown a cannoli out  bought the premade large eggplant parm  we were disappointed maybe because of the sauce i dont know but i cant recommend it  now my sister and brotherinlaw go all the time and purposely for the eggplant parm soyou decide  we have found more authentic italian markets around florida in fort myers marios and miami and cape coral with great authentic sauces etc  if you want the best of the best then get your italian pastry in new york city at veneiros and get your italian goodies at eataly in chelsea  sorry we are spoiled exnew yorkers so hard to please us  mazzaros is ok for the experience and a onetime visit but wont be a staple for usi am a ridiculously huge fan of taco bell in the sense that i could eat it for lunch almost every day and then go back for dinner  this particular taco bell is the worst i have ever ever been to    the wait times are just outragous whether in store or in the drivethrough  i dont know if it is the staff or lack of management or both combined but something definitely needs to be changed at this location  i will say this is the first time in about the 50 times i have been there that my order was completely correct  but hell it should have been considering i was there for 25 minutes or more  i should not be able to go to a sit down restaurant and potentially get my food quicker than i would through this fast food jointmeh thats really all i have to say about this place food was ok service was awful the bartenders were more concerned about texting and laughing with their friends than bringing another drink i will be back to see if maybe it was a fluke but at this point i doubt it1040 am and they are out of dark roast no offer to make more they are out for the day  its almost as though they arent a coffee place typical day you have to request creamer at the counter putting you back in line behind four people one employee glances up at your request and then leaves  apparently customer service is not part of her job descriptioni dont usually review chainsbut i think something needs to be said i went here today to pick up some coffee and general treats on my way to see a friend the staff were so rude i mean they couldnt seem to understand my order in the fist place and then were pretty slack about making my order and the drinks still turned out wrong was pretty disappointed and probably wont be back to this location especially considering there are sooo many starbucks locations in the downtownthis place is entirely too pushy  my bf and i love tea and we usually know what we want andor what we like i didnt like their approach in this store at all which is to talk to you as if they are the experts and you know nothing  lol  the woman in the store tried her damndest to sell us the entire overpriced store  we already knew we wanted african rooibos tea well then she brought us sample after sample of different teas  and then she wanted to sell us the biggest size she could and then a tin versus a bag and then of course tea bags tea makers kettles sweeteners and mugslol lady please  its tea for crying out loud    my advice have a price in mind that you want to spend and stick to it otherwise you could get sucked into their sales pitch and end up spending waaaaay too much moneywanted to like this place but was disappointed  the building and decor are nice the service was good but the food was the let down  i ordered the italian pork sandwich which lacked pork and was mostly just bread for 14 sandwich  i expected more my friends ordered the nco burger wings and the reuben and were all just averagei checked out the menu for taqueria del sol and was excited to try it what a disappointment  the service was friendly although they ran out of tea there was a manthe manager i assumehovering over all the workers making them nervous and not improving the service he happily offered to order some kid to brew more but it wasnt done before i was ready to leave im surprised they didnt realize they were low when nearly everyone was ordering it   the food was the problem though it was bad my enchilada was ice cold but served quickly on a very hot plate they subscribe to the school of excess cheese standing in for flavor i also ordered a veggie taco which was good but not great   im always eager to try a new place close by but taqueria del sol may not earn a second visit if i get a hankering for that veggie taco in a couple of months i may go see if theyve ironed out their kinkswhen they first opened i came here a couple of times for dinner initially they were almost as good as minados another bigname buffet but recently the selection and quality has downgraded a lot dont know whos in management now but it sure looks like theyre trying to cut costs down and have become very americanized with their menu im pretty sure i can get fries at mcdonalds why bother having sushi buffet in their name if the americanized foods outnumbers the sushi they offer was looking forward towards some beef short rib and seafood soup and of course an ample variety of sushi  but those are no longer offered me and my group arrived about 3 hours before closing time on a thursday night while it was still sort of packed we had to park in the back however it appeared that they stopped making sushi around that time leaving only a couple plain pieces on the serving plates im sure the 10 cooks they got behind the island couldve replenished that the price has went down slightly but the selection went down greatly   pros very attentive and sharplooking waiters good ambience interior design nice hostess nice bathroom  cons limited sushi selection no premium rolls a lot of offerings are americanized or fried everything no green tea ice cream or yogurt dishes are not replenished fast enough when empty   my suggestion go to minados to get your moneys worth   until then i would not be returning until i hear that this place has improvedway overpriced fifteen bucks for a little burger used to give you coleslaw but no more the quantity of the food went down within the past year no more going back there fries were cold and food took foreeeeeeever to comeit was busy this time but considering this is like my tenth time here ive come to have very low expectations there is a honda dealership near by and coffee isnt so great worth walking to dunkin for coffee however if you order anything but coffee be aware i often get the wrong items wrong quantity or even dont get things today was particularly bad its mothers day and it seems they have been stockpiling the items because the muffins were sooooo dry as in they crumbled just getting the wrapper off the bottom it was like eating croutons that were muffin flavor very dissatisfied coffee was good as always so whatever good stinks but coffee is close to where i drop of car so most likely ill be back something better than nothingthey must have thought it was my first time salmon smelled horrible and was sweating after losing my appetite i sent the food back paid for my beer and lefti was not a big fan of our concert experience here  its extremely small and there were way too many people allowed in  they are asking for a disaster with so many people cramped into an area with only three exits  the design does not give you an area to get relief from the crowd  the concert goers were extremely rude  i have seen flogging molly in concert almost ten times in different venues and this was the worst experience i have had  i will not be driving two hours to come to this venue againwas pretty excited to check out a new korean place especially one mostly dedicated to fried chicken and some random things   the chicken itself comes in two flavours crispy deep fried with breading and sweet  hot sauce a bonus is that every order is lovingly deep fried into oblivion in seven minutes so youre not getting some old refried leftovers like mcdonalds and their hash browns and your chickens going to be burning hot yeah  unfortunately this is where i felt a bit let down  the crispy version didnt that much taste to it i guess its so you can taste the chicken itself but it was just wasnt particularly exciting you know i loved the texture of the breading thoughmmm   meanwhile the hot  spicy chicken has a very strong hot pepper paste taste i like cooking korean food and love using hot pepper paste but i dont like it when the whole thing tastes like nothing but hot pepper paste the sauce just had too much of it and i couldnt taste anything else   this place could be kinda pricey at 2299 for 10 pieces as you only get one side to go with that daikon or fries nothing special the chicken is supposed to be 100 hormone free and all that niceness though so that could also account for the higher price  lots of people do takeout but if you sit in you can also ask for some tea the restaurants very spacious and clean i also saw a lunch special for 7   overall im still looking for a good korean fried chicken joint in edmonton i can keep going back to but ill probably have to continue satisfying my cravings elsewhere for nowvery disappointed it wasnt too long ago when this was an outstanding subway my husband and i have traveled all around the country and have been to many subways but no one came close to this one now all of a sudden they have become the worst the last couple of times we ordered a tuna sub the girl behind the counter put such a small amount of tuna on that you could actually see the bread in many spots usually they put three scoops of tuna on a foot long but she put one on and then scooped half of that back on the same size sandwich you couldnt even tell there was tuna in it our neighbor told us yesterday that they did the very thing to her with the tuna at the same subway i hope they change back to the way they werethey are starting to lose their best customerstotally overrated   food doesnt taste good beef noodle was overcooked beef not tender sausage bento boxs sausage super greasy   i suspect the good reviews are fake   maybe good for reno but no where close to good in authentic chinesetaiwanese food standardfood is overpriced and the menu online is not the same as the menu in the cafe  the food is the same but the prices are vastly different  false advertising not impressedi ordered a salad for takeout and a grilled cheese for my kiddo the prices were higher than i expected grilled cheese was cold and hard they forgot the pickle they forgot to make the chocolate drink my bread roll was hard a a rock the staff was not very pleasant i wont returnas a 12 year customer of the inn and restaurant and previous raving five star supporterim sad to say the magic seems to be gone once upon a time i raved and bragged about the dk and to be sure i have many fond memories it was my home away from home i thought they cared for me as much as i did them now i see they are a businessi am a revenue source and i understand just how much sam understood about the difference between pleasing a customer for the night versus maintaining a loyal patron for life twelve years was a great run though thanks for the memoriesnot impressive at all i ordered turkey hummus wraps turned out that half of my wraps barely contained any turkey only green and hummus what a surprisecoffee is decent prices are alright for there coffee the food is way overpriced for the quality that you get and they have a huge drive thru issue sometimes  you cant even drive down the road because people have blocked it waiting to ordernot impressed  all the orders were wrong   my grilled chicken sandwich was missing the ranch dressing barrys buffalo chicken salad was missing the blue cheese crumbles and the blue cheese dressing and mak was terrible  the chicken croquet had no chicken and the peas and carrots were seriously over cooked  the waitress was awful   unless it was her first day  dont think we will be back anytime sooni always considered applebees as an average place the food is hohum nothing special at times i wonder how long has that food been sitting there i believe a lot of food is precooked earlier that day then microwaved and served i think the burgers are cooked fresh though just fyi to any of the previous posters or whomever reads this review this applebees on castor is the trainingeval center i havent really had a problem with the actual service here its just the food isnt the best this goes for all applebees although im sure some are better than othersits okay it one likes overpriced ice creamthe gotta have it menu nice its fixed in front of you with a few dollops of the stuff and extras  without coupons not worth itcept for those who supposedly have the  or the credit cards to blow on disposables such as thisthe food was very good service at the bar was just unbelievable rude my boyfriend and i arrived for dinner at 830 and service started out great but then rapidly went downhill my boyfriend is a bartender and i am a chef and understand having bad days not wanting to be there wanting to have all your side work done and wanting to leave as soon as you can at the end of your shift one of the bartenders was already breaking things down when we ordered dinner at 840 then both of them started completely breaking down the bar by 9scrubbing pulling out the grates etc etc we both would have had a few more drinks and we were not the only ones there so this was not the case of we were the last ones in the bar and didnt realize everyone wanted to go home  there is a way to make your customers happy and quietly do your side work and not alienating them we didnt want to make small talk with them we just wanted service and to not smell cleaning products while we ate we typically tip over 20 we did still tip just not as generously  as we usually do though the food was good we will most likely not return because of how horrible the bar staff lacked in professionalismthis place is by my job so i stopped in one evening for lunch food was mediocre at best and its expensive couldve went to bandanas and had better food 19 for a chicken dinnerone thing is true about great scot its not great id say its average first thing is the convenience and that definitely is great but the downside is whoever runs this place knows fools like me will pay more so we dont have to walk too far so they jack up the prices secondly they are always out of stuff white meat ground turkey sells out withing a few hours while dark meat lingers there youd think theyd change the orders around same with cereal the cereal i want is always sold out i asked the manager to order something for me and he wouldnt that sucked but on the other hand the checkout people are really nice if only webvan was still around i wouldnt have to settle for great scotslow apathetic service three people behind the counter and my drink came up before i even got to the counter  i wanted to beg for them to hurry up it was all i could do not to yell please pay attention take care of the customers standing right in front of you  but i didnt  and i stood in line 10 mins while they helped the two people in front of me  this particular location was a bit dirty as well  not my favorite starbucks thats for sureif im going to pay 9 for a burger it better be good  my last venture to 500 was a waste of my money  i got the turbo burger because i love spice and pickled jalapenos the fries were great crispy with the nice earthy tang of truffle but the burger was seriously disappointing  i ordered it medium rare and it came out well done and the cheese wasnt even melted the person who rung me up was sullen and gruff i had to ask twice to get my cup for water really the only good part was the fries i wont be backi really wanted to like this place but after my second visit they did not convince me the first time i went a few months ago the service was spotty and their breakfast was bland to say the least i had the apple oatmeal which needed heaping amounts of brown sugar to make it taste like anything also their coffee seems to have a funny taste and always seems to come out cold when i went more recently i found a hair in my oatmeal gross needless to say i was planning on returning to try their pancakes but after the hair experience i think ill make my own at homeive lived in nashville my entire life and ive noticed that this place seems to be a staple for a lot of newcomers and tourists but im not entirely sure why i couldnt have helped but notice the insanely long lines wrapping around the building so one day i decided to try it myself  i was not impressed with the food here at all its your average breakfast food and honestly the quality is about the same as something youd get at ihop while there is a wide variety of different pancakes to choose from i still wouldnt say that this makes the restaurant worth it if youre looking for a good breakfast restaurant save yourself the time and choose somewhere else  however if youre wanting to try to popular restaurants in nashville but dont care too much in terms of quality for the price then this is the place for youchecked out this place for the first time last week location is cool i love nolibs   you start of with a bowl of rice or salad and add on tip you can pick between 3 and 5 scoops of fish not rice serving of rice stays the same i got a mix of octopus salmon and tuna it was okay way too much sauce and it took away from the entire bowl tip a little goes a long way stick to minimal toppings and ask for less sauce the food itself was overwhelmingly soaked in soy sauce and it kind of ruined my first poke experience  service was fine the glass wall makes it hard to communicate with the employees so make sure to speak a little louder they guy who rang me up kept calling me mamma which made me very uncomfortable i dont think i will be going back ill wait until my honeymoon to hawaii in 2090this pathmark is just bad for produce meats  seafood really bad go elsewhere please  if you need the basic staples for your pantry  you live in the neighborhood  you dont drive work it out as best you canfour stars for product  zero stars for the rudest most arrogant obnoxious customer service  i should have walked out of there  but i didnt and i am still kicking myself  pralines are good  good texture good bite quality i would go slightly less on the sugar and more on the flavour  but good product nonethelesswaited 45 minutes before they even offered to take our order this was after wed told our waiter we were ready to order and he said hed be right back and then disappeared for twenty minutes we spoke to the manager who gave us our two beers for free as well as a 10 credit so  its probably a nice place but theyve gotta work on training their staff a lotwe ordered 2 calzones cajun bread and brownies the food was good delivery was prompt and the employees were polite and nice the 2 star review is based on a service error and missed opportunity to fix it our order was missing sauces for both calzones and the bread i called the store to report the missing items they were kind and said they would send out the missing items with the driver they never delivered the missing sauces you pay a delivery fee here we picked this place because they deliver i wont suggest this place to my friends and will avoid it next time my wife and i want deliveryits a bit too americanized for me i didnt think it was authentic indian its like panda express for indian food the food was pretty mediocre im probably going to continue going to more authentic places like india sizzling and india palace on the plus side the decor and service were goodwhere to start about hendricks horrible service not our servers fault we showed up and the stuck us at a table not easily accessible to said server i could see the server being overworked so im not passing blame to this person at all the fooooodddddd wassssss groooossss there is nothing worse than taking one bite of a pulled pork popover and tasting only the breading and no hint of the smoked ghouda boasted on the menu or the meat for that matter everything else was just ok that all i have to say about this placei came in to sit and have a coffee today and make a business phone call i walked in about 215pm through the side door on north forsyth i wasnt greeted by anyone and everyone seemed busy so i just headed to the register the redhead working the register was very friendly and nice my iced latte was very tasty i sat down to make my call and it lasted till just after 3pm employees had been sweeping while i was on the phone but i had no idea that the cafe closed at 3pm just after i got off the phone a woman wearing a green shirt came around the corner by the counter clasped her hands together and basically shouted at me mam we are closed instead of approaching me and politely informing me oneonone she apparently felt like that was an appropriate way to treat a customer this was the first time ive been in the location and although i loved the service the redhead provided i will not be back i do not like feeling like i am being kicked out of a locallyrun establishment because i honestly did not know about the shops hours if retaining patrons is an objective of companions company that employee needs to be remindedthe place is dark and noisy service is good but at montecito pace ie slow the greek omelette was totally bland due to lack of any seasoning potatoes tasted old but the bacon was goodthe food is okaynot fantastic  just hohum okay the service varies from wonderful to frustrating it is always disappointing and unappealing to have dirty tables seats and floors when you are eating its understandable if the place is crazy busy but not when there are just a few tables occupied  but even if the place is crazy busyclear the tables clean off the seats so you dont leave customers waitingi dont know if it is staffing issues or something else its a shame because this could be a go to hang out spot for friends to have a drink and mealbut grabbing a burger at the place one block down the 21 burger joint was a better experience and i have give this place a dozen chancesso today was a day where my wife wanted to try something different and new cool why not i mean new is always good right but in this case it was wrong in so many ways  we were out and driving down dale mabry and she said lets go into this shopping area we were surrounded by different options and she saw jazz open for breakfast new orleans style food so she was sold when you walk in you can see the potential in it though the decor was to dark especially during the day you could see the vision they had for when it was a jazz night   the hostess petal was 1 of 2 things that were right for our visit here the 2nd was the 2 for 1 mimosas she made omg not shy with the champagne just the way a mimosa should be so we were like okay we might be okay here once the food arrived it was straight downhill and whats so bad about it is you want to root for this place every thing that came out you can tell there is no love being put into these dishes every last one looked like something you can make at home and even better looking as well  my wife had the chicken and waffles lil man had pancake 1 and eggs and i had the tace classic egg benedict which came with  thinly sliced ham two poached eggs topped w louisiana hot sauce hollandaise choice of fresh fruit grits or brabant potato when the plate arrived no ham for it wasnt thawed so they replaced it with bacon i wasnt asked if i wanted grits or fruit they just decided for me and did put what suppose to be a fancier named for home fries brabant potato  the food was something a guy might try to make to impress his girlfriend that spend the night i do believe a real chef is needed and not that average joe they have back there cooking because nothing is new orleans about their food i can see why this place is empty and starbucks is winning goes to show you people would rather have microwave food then this establishment food next time if we decide to come again will be for petals 2 for 1 mimosas she made us cause this was the only thing worth paying fori stopped off here for lunch with a number of colleagues and noticed that the lunch menu had changed i decided to go light  and went for a cup of avgolemono and a grilled calamari salad the soup was ok the squid tasted old ive loved this place in the past and will revisit hoping this was an exception   the new menu is a bit more oriented to lunch with fewer choices also a bit of a disappointmentwhen i specifically ask for extra ranch and you dont give me extra ranch you fail i was also asked to pull around the front and wait for fries i have been going to eegees all my life and that has never happened before and i had to wait a long whilenoisy poor service not a pub experience in any way shape or formthis is probably the blandest pizza in east nashville the crust has less flavor than most frozen pizzas i gave them more than 1 star just because they are in my neighborhood and i want them to be better than they are i order from here about 1 once a year and that reminds me why i go other places their wings are good but if your looking for pizza id suggest going elsewheredriving around downtown looking for food and happened upon maynards the atmosphere inside is very welcoming and eclectic menus are provided when you are waiting in line the food was amazing i highly recommend the jerk chicken and chicken salad  sandwich my main issue is with the service and time in which our food was brought to us as we waited my friend received her food first after 15 minutes we asked a passing waiter for our food 5 minutes later they explained there was a mix up 5 minutes after that we received our food with a quick apology i wont be returningthe owners need to fix the place up the food is good though the employees are nice but not as efficienti gave two stars only because the girl who took our order was very nice  the food however  was awful we both had the fuji apple chicken salad at the same price and my daughters order had barley half as much as mine and they didnt give her any salad dressing  mine came with two containers of salad dressing but  they were each only 14 full if that  my salad looked bigger because it was mostly kale the menu says mixed greens i felt like they dumped in whatever green  they needed to get rid of and so i dumped the nasty bitter saladkale into the garbage after just a few bites i had asked for extra cucumbers which have always come thinly sliced on the top of the salad at every other panera i have been to  these were chopped and there was barely any let alone the extra i ordered  and to just add insult to injury the apple chips were stale chewy and nasty  so much for a crisp fall salad  so much for ever visiting this panera again first and last time  we ordered to go and should have checked our food before we left  spent 2300 on a disaster dinner and will never go back again because the manager on duty was the one overseeing the making of our meal  wish someone from the district or regional office would see this  we didnt stay to eat there because  yes the dining room was too awful to sit in worst panera i have ever been tofor the pricewhich is not cheap for a pizzeria this place falls far below average food was not very good also i went during a time where there were only 3 groups of diners and the staff out numbered us 21 however it took forever for them to take my tables order and to get my food and drink and did not even receive proper utensils to remove the hot pizza from the dish   the whole time the wait staff were chatting behind the barriers by the register no respect for the individuals who are paying their wages idk how the owner isnt more on top of this it makes your establishment look very badthe pho was tasty although considerably less tasty than that of pho nouveau downtown my biggest problem was that they would only sell bottled water after having put my last dollar and change in the tip jar i had to run another transaction to get a bottle of water with my meal for 1 i guess i just felt nickel and dimed   i know they dont have to but i would sure appreciate it if they would provide the common service of water with my meal i like my pho spicystaff was pretty friendly   the food area was a bit of a mess   the pinto bean looked like bean paste not refried bean but bean paste very unappetizing   the portions were once again very small   ordered a burrito and it ultimately looked like a frozen burrito you would get from a truck stop   hopefully after 282016 something will be done to get portions consistent as well as do something with the bean paste   certainly not my favorite chipotle   i miss the days when going to chipotle was satisfyingdecent snowball joint where you can drive through for your chill fix  they are heavy on the syrup pour and the sizes are large and cheap  the ice consistency just wasnt my cup of tea and it seemed more like a snow cone instead of a snowball but that might have been due to the very heavy syrup pourmy favorite dish here is the two way salad with the curry chicken and grape chicken salads  i came here today for lunch and noticed the size of the scoops changed from the medium scoop to a mini scoop  it was barely a nibble of each of the chicken salads  i left hungry and had to order more food to go  quit being cheap and go back to the medium scoop  i feel ripped offi love sweets and cinnamon rolls but i was very disappointed with this place the rolls are large but dry and the icing is overly sweet and you can crunch on the sugar granules i tried a plain and one with various toppings and they were pretty disgustingpicked up some brownies and pecan pie around 530 yesterday  it would be a good idea for the management to taste these items at this time of day  the brownies were blah and stale  and guys you have got to have a better recipe for pecan pie  the pie was below average and we didnt get much bang for our buck  we brought these desserts to our relatives for dinner and now wish we hadnt  love a lot about johnsons corner farm  the desserts do not match upjust ok our group had salads and impossible burgers the meatless burger yeah it was edible but not something worth more than actual meat unless youre veggie salads were also just ok  good draft beer prices thoughi wish this place was better being in my neighborhood and in walking distance but its pretty mediocre i wish theyd address the gummy flour tacos the fillings  when theyre hot  are pretty good but honestly the tacos ruin iti recently visited this diner due to a segment on the local  news in the winter while the service was ok the food was less than pleasing it was tasteless and not appetizing at all the bacon and turkey sausage were like plastic and cardboard could have went to a fast food joint for that the only thing worth ordering was the rye toast even the cranberry juice was not a good brand of juice needless to say i will not be returning i will visit michaels if i need a diner or fairlane grill in flourtown i only gave 2 stars because the service was not badquick shout outs  our server jordan worked really hard to make our meal enjoyable  he was prompt and responsive and my family and i really appreciated his effort  now to the review  the food was pretty good when it came out correctwe are vegetarian and ordered the brussel sprouts without bacon two pizzas margharita and potato and one pasta arrabiata  when the person brought the brussel sprouts to the table she said there was no meatbut in my first bite i had a piece of bacon definitely disappointed from that experience  luckily they paid extra attention to the rest of our order and made sure everything was correct  i think the kitchen at this place is very overwhelmed  this actually leads to the main reason for the 2star review  we made a reservation for 6 at 730p  when we got there at 725p they told us that the had 2 other parties of 6 that needed to be seated before us and the kitchen was running behind  we said that we had a reservation but apparently so did the other parties  why in the world would they book three reservations at the same time when they clearly didnt have the spaceability to accommodate we heard similar comments about why even make a reservation from most of the people waiting in the waiting area  when we finally got seated30 mins after our reservationit was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates   the food was the redeeming quality for my experience  my brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner  eventually the negative experience is going to outweigh the quality of foodand i feel thats going to happen pretty quick they need to figure something out to turn around the service and fastnormally we love this place but i ordered the meatloaf and after a few bites i noticed the it was uncooked in the center  asked the waiter if any pork was in the recipe and he checked and yes there was pork  i asked to have it heated to proper temperature and it came back undercooked again  they took it off my bill but i had to go home and make a sandwich i went here a few months ago with my girlfriend the service seemed decent at first because we were seated within a few minutes our food took 25 minutes to come out which was ok but seemed a little long for just two burgers and some fries to be honest the burgers were on the bland side though and the portion was tiny for the price it tasted like something i could make at home ive got your typical college student cooking skills plus i was a little confused because the menu description for my burger listed bacon jam but i didnt taste any  heres the kicker nearly 30 minutes into our meal the waiter approaches our table with two more burgers he told us our food was here but awkwardly stuttered as he walked away after we told him he was at the wrong table a light bulb flashed in my head and i realized that those burgers were actually the ones we ordered we had been eating the wrong ones the waiter knew this when he saw the food on our table and craftily walked away trying to hide this this place doesnt deserve 1 star because the food although bland and overpriced was edible the service was decent despite the fact that we were served the wrong order the correct order took nearly 50 minutes to reach our table by the way i wont be returningwe liked the food but were completely ignored at the ordering counter by four employees  they would make eye contact with us and continue to not help us  it was extremely rude and unprofessional  i will not ever go back here  then when one employee finally decided to acknowledge us i asked if they were still open at 8pm because of how poorly we were treated  then a second employee decided to help the first employee put a glove on to start handling food items and jokingly slapped the first employee in the back of his head neck with the food glove  then started working with the food i thought i was being pranked this place is a total jokei dont get the fun in slot machines  im not a gambler and i never have been  nothing here was much fun for me  i walked through the whole casino  it was very smoky and had a bad smell i didnt enjoy myself the whole time i was there there are few restaurants they look great but im not sure if its worth the smoke and smelli was looking forward to this place  after eating there i will be in no hurry to return for the food    pros  very good beer selection  many drafts and bottled beers    cool atmosphere   5 minutes from my house  cons  service we found 2 seats at the bar to bypass the wait  it was very busy but the bartender was not very attentive and he was either drunk  high or both  food seriously ive eaten better mexican food at chilis  i couldnt agree more with wandas assessment of the salsa  it was awful  rotel is much better than what we ate  the burrito was ok too much rice  my wife liked her quasadilla but i wasnt impressed  the nachos were decent  also the appetizer selection was lacking  only about 5 appetizers on the menu    this place is racking up now because the mexican bargrill concept is novel for the area  its also a good place to drink  but based on the food and service i will not be going backthe food here is delicious however i spent 12 for a sandwich and side and it took over 30 minutes to order and receive my food  they had 4 kids working the entire place while eating my food i overheard several other customers complain about how they are always short staffed one lady never even received her sandwichshe had to go up and ask multiple times about it then finally ask for a refund good food but service is definitely lackingeveryone loves it here i clearly am not everyone which is sad because i had really been wanting to try it so i made a res for brunch on opentable and despite planning ahead it still took 20 min to get us a table once seated our waitress took forever to come over and im pretty sure she never heard the expression service with a smile as she had a dour frown the whole time she negligently served us we got egg dishes that were clearly fresh and could have been outstanding but lacking spice and love when we asked for toast she told us there was no bread like the bread that came with our eggs there was none so i guess the bread we had was a mirage perhaps it was just a bad day but id have to be strongly persuaded to ever go back note this is the worst review ive ever given i generally only yelp if i love something so its not as though i like to pan placesi went here with high hopesbut it disappointed me on all fronts so ill stick to silk city or farmacia for furture brunchesits worse than i thought their chicken is processed stuff fake chewy meat  yechthe food is decent if overpriced the beer acceptable the customer service varies i enjoy the live music more than anything in my humble opinion there needs to be more variety in the beer offered bring back scottish aleusually enjoy this place a lot i asked for burger medium and it was close to burnt burgers are usually spot onthe store and employees are fine in fact a couple of the employees are very fineas in sexy as hell but all these complaints about the pharmacy are 100 accurate they never act with any sense of urgency even though the line of customers is usually at least 5 deep and they display almost zero empathy when you call youre always on hold for at least a couple minutes before you end up talking to someone who sounds too bored to be bothered   my doctor said they sent a prescription to cvs a few days ago i still hadnt received the call from cvs telling me that its ready i just called and a girl who sounded too tired to fully form words managed to tell me that she sees it in the system she said they can fill it today if id like to pick it up i said well yeah her response itll be about an hour to ninety minutes   1 why would it take 90 minutes to put pills in a bottle  2 why did they not fill the rx when it originally came in from my doctor  the answer to both questions is incompetencegross first time at aldi there were fruit flies and moldy veggies out i may try the one in clearwater next time since the produce section is highly recommended by several friends wasnt impressed with this oneive been here more times than i can count as it is a frequent stop when my husband  i go out on the motorcycle the service is hit or miss the food is oknot great not awful drinks are usually strong although you dont get very much in a cocktail they sometimes have live music and thats a fun time parking area is small overall i would never choose to come here on my own but its easy to make the best of the situation when youre hereim giving these guys 2 stars i have been waiting over an hour for food because somebody bought all the fried chicken no excuse we ordered 2 pieces of chicken for my kids i could literally fry 2 pieces of chicken in my house in this time  there is no place to wait and they give you your order complete shape up guys im being a little harsh because this place is owned by another restaurant you should be able to adjust accordingly i will change my review based on another trip but as of now be prepared for an hour wait for foodthe starbucks locations in tampa bay are below average usually they are mobbed and have below average staff in terms of drinkmaking skills this location is no exception if you want a large starbucks to hang out in check out the one on mlk jr blvd in tampa its never mobbed and staff are nice5 drinks is wonderful if they didnt run out of ribs at 730pm on thursday  wings and pazookie are good  one time i got marinara instead of salsa lmaothis is our first visit since the remodel  the atmosphere is much more sterile and loud   we ordered quiche for 8  the slice was tasty yet rather small for the price   the coffee menu has fewer options than pre remodel  this will be our last visit  this change was definitely not an improvementive been here 6 or 7 times  the food is consistently good if overpriced 1214 mexican entrees  however almost every time there has been a service issue regardless of time of day or how busy it is  they really havent figured out the timingsometimes you sit for 10 minutes before a server introduces themselves  other times you order chipssalsa which is now an extra charge and it comes out a minute before the food  this past weekend there was no host at the host stand for a good 5 minutes even when the place was quiet  when we were finally seated we were bounced between two different hosts and in the process our menus and silverware were left in a pile on a different table for us to fetch ourselves  several weeks ago i ordered a beer and the server cleared it when there were several sips remaining  i will say that on two or three occasions ive raised concerns to the manager and have found himher to be competent apologetic and accommodating about the situation  but i really just want a problemfree meal and that seems hard to come by at the wynnewood locationsuper long line and only drip coffee and no gluten free pancakes big disappointment considering that it comes up on gluten free search on yelpfrom the moment we walken in i was conflicted on one hand the staff was attractive and the tvs were nice but the smell was like an aquarium maybe its just the new bar smell our bartender was friendly though she was brushing her hair with her hand while talking to usweird then it gets worse she lets us sample a local craft beer but she sips out of the cup firstafter placing our order she wipes her nose with her hand while pouring the beer and the beer is not the one we ordered just a brush up on bar awareness and techniques and ill come back im gonna wait till they weed out the grossness nice tvsif your going to see a concert and planning on drinking i highly recommend pre gaming it somewhere else their drink prices are absolutely absurd you would think paying 710  for a 2 ingredient drink it would at least be a good one nope you can barely taste the alcohol they dont allow smoking inside so thats nice but the place is a tiny little hole in the wall ive been to two shows so far going to sick puppies tomorrow i got invited as vip by the lead singer of blue october its a cool story  and some chick metal band was not interested in that one two much anyway i was not impressed with any of the staff or the venue why do these artists choose such a dump i went to rise against in the gsr that was freakin awesome why not pick a nicer place if the place got a bigger crowd for more popular artists i would hate to see what a nightmare that would be will post my experience with tomorrows concert in the tip sectionwe had a less than stellar experience tonight we came in for a birthday dinner and i called earlier in the afternoon to see whether they did anything special they dont which is fine but the response i got wasnt the warmest and its hard to imagine that a birthday dessert is an unusual request they told me it was acceptable for us to bring our own cake so i dont think ill keep this place in mind for future celebrations  unfortunately our server spilled an entire drink on one of our party members almost immediately after they arrived it could happen to anyone it wasnt that big of a deal although im sure it wasnt very comfortable for him everyone dealt with it the manager made a point to come over and tell us it was our servers first night we all blew it over no big deal i was disappointed at the end of the night though to see that nothing at all had been comped to make up for the inconvenience and discomfort we were a large enough party that there was a substantial check and not even a single cocktail or cup of coffee was spared from the tabulation   as for the actual meal the food was great but it all came out at exactly the same time we ordered the whipped ricotta vassi which is an amazing opener but within minutes of its arrival the pizza cameand then two saladsand then the antipasti and the pasta all within a span of 5 minutes our table was crowded we felt like they were rushing us out the door and we couldnt savor the different courses of our meals to me that was the worst part of the meal though to our wet friend perhaps that seemed less offensive the remainder of the service was slow and clunky  all in all i was really disappointed by a place that i have really enjoyed in the past we can all appreciate a few mistakes here or there or the bumps in the road that might come with training a new person she was otherwise a friendly server and was doing well for her first night but she could have used more guidance and it might have been nice to give a more seasoned server to a large party that made a reservation and made it clear we were celebrating a birthday   food is good but i was very disappointed by the servicethe wait was very long to sit down get order in and get the food  at the end of the day the food was just okay  we went there out of convenience from the hotel but next time we stay there we will go out and find a restaurantan old girlfriend introduced me to the original crabby bills in indian rocks beach back in the 1980s  it was fun the food was simple and plentiful a place on the rise  like far too many restaurants when they open new locations and time goes by the quality goes downhill rapidly  put simply this is a tourist trap that survives with tiny portions of passable seafood at prices much too high for what you get  even the early bird is overpriced  out of town friends insisted on taking me there 2215 the blackened mahimahi was small tasty but eminently unremarkable the sides of french fries and steamed broccoli were below ordinary  service is disinterested  avoidwhat happened westmont diner made a visit for dinner recently and im sad to say that everything was off waitress coughed in her hands food was lackluster burger underdone and needed to be sent back it wasnt even a busy night im sorry to say that it was such a disappointing experience that we wont be back for some time i hope things turn around as we have enjoyed it in the pasti have never in my life been so physically uncomfortable in a restaurant that the owners of zeppoli serve 5 star food and it is while you are expected to sit in a chair made for a kindergartener is beyond comprehension i walked in looked at those 5 wooden chairs with no cushion no real backs and was so disappointed this is how i was supposed to relax and enjoy my meal then i sat and the featherweight chair slid around the floor every time i breathed also had to put my bag on the hard floor that everything we ordered was wonderful just makes this all the more frustrating why on earth do they not immediately remedy this situation by purchasing any kind of decent chairs for this one tiny room its inexcusable they will never be a really great restaurant so long as they make ignorant careless choices that directly detract from the dining experience id sooner get my meal to go than make a reservation here again please invest in your business this is all so avoidablei have to agree with a yahoo reviewerthe attitude here is really arrogant  even on the phone if you press for customer service the phone is answered with a tone of voice that lets you know the employee is clearly annoyed with you   there is too much competition in the natural products market for this type of  unprofessionalism the management  is completely supportive of  the overall atmosphere of rudeness  shop somewhere else do not support a business that is out of touch with those of us who financially support them  gary world of  whoopie just give me your money  get out does not deserve your consideration strong review but well deserved and very fair change it  i will review againbeer was drinkable but probably doesnt inspire me to want to drink much of it  the biggest challenge here is that the interior warehouse space gets very hot and uncomfortable  so far this is probably my least favorite brewery experience in the nola areavery disappointed being a chicago born guy tried the italian beefsausage combo and was nothing like bueno beef or portillos just another copycat trying to use chicagos name well guess i have to make a road trip to chitown to get my fixthe food was marginal at best my regular size build your own burger did not live up to the 519 price tag it had ok flavor and the toppings were uninspiring fries are an absolute disappointment in serving size flavor and price it is also too bad that the only soft drink options are their own private label soft drinks no coke or pepsi products  my 10 for lunch it would have been more if i hadnt had water would have been better spent at five guys steaknshake or a number of other placeswe spent happy hour at the depot before a reno aces game  their appetizer selections and drink specials for happy hour were many but i would suggest trying a cocktail instead of their beer  we got a flight of all of their ipas  the wanderer was our favorite beer of the bunch but to be honest it didnt have much competition  the beers were very forgettable  we also ordered the kale dip with pita bread  the dip must have been heated in a microwave or something because it was different temperatures all the way throughi feel i must complete this review my sister and i went to coffee  on saturday afternoon june 17th she ordered a chicken salad sandwich on french bread and a side of potato salad i ordered a roast beef on french dressed the chicken salad was so salty my sister could not eat it the roast beef was half burnt the lettuce was a dark green not sure what kind the tomatoes and pickles were cut very thick not adding to what i thought would be a tasteful experience   i have been a frequent customer and have never had anything i didnt like served to me we told the waitress what had happened she tried her best to make things right under the circumstances in the end we were only charged for the potato salad and one drink  at no time did the present manager come to speak to us preferring to let the waitress handle the situation we were also told there was a different cook in the afternoon preparing the food  i was very disappointed as i had brought my sister there as a treat and to introduce her to coffee  needless to say we were both disappointed not sure if i will be backif everfood was okay  but  expensive for what you get  staff leaves a lot to be desired  seems like they hire the best for the least amount of money  bathrooms were clean  had some dirty tables that needed to be cleaned  i dont think i will be backbelow average tasting mexican food prices are reasonable and the menu has standard items staff is polite but tables and menus are dirtyi ordered the banh mi sandwich  the large or full size i dont recall their term  the food was tasty though it could have used more pickled radish  unfortunately tasty did not satisfy  the large sandwich left me hungry after eating it and 45 minutes later i was famished the same goes for a coworker   this was not worth 9 when you can get the same sandwich in iv for about 4foods good but there is not seating and its very loud they ran out of ciabatta bunsi was really excited to try this place esp because my regular taco food truck was nowhere to be found todayunfortunately the beef burrito i had was incredibly tasteless i had no idea burritos could even be that tasteless and yet there it was   the other reviews seem to love it so maybe it was an off day or maybe i ordered the wrong thing i cant argue that the price is amazing for the quantity of food but honestly id rather spend an extra dollar and get a better burrito elsewherei eat here a lot because its convenient theyve changed owners a time or two and the latest set seems to know what theyre doing ive tried a lot of things off their menu and about the only thing ill order now are the wings which are much improved from several months ago they are now bigger and tend to be well cooked whereas before they were generally overcooked and runty looking beer is good and reasonably priced they have fat tire for 275pint they have a lot of turnover on the wait staff and on a couple of occasions ive walked in to see them surrounded by their friends at the bar minus a star for having to hang around them while waiting for my order   nothing is really disgusting but nothing is worth ordering twice onion rings are forgettable oysters suck previous poster billie got it righti had almost the exact same story except substitute louisiana for texas burgers are very average they dont serve crab legs anymore po boys are a joke salads arent anything special and their appetizers arent appetizing chili is ok but they keep changing the amount they give you for 395 it used to be quite generous but now they put your chili in a square shaped container i dont understand its a sort of soup and theyre serving it like its a bag of french fries they also charge 50 cents for everything want onions on your chili 50 cents cheese another 50 cents jalapenos another 50 cents i stopped ordering the chili   my suggestion wait until wednesday or saturday and get their 50 cent wings or drink their beer and walk over to med cuisine or over to cross corner grill if you want decent bar fareafter a friend told me how great this place was and i went to sketch in fishtown i decided to stop here for dinner to compare which burger place is better and i definitely say sketch is way better came on a weeknight and wax a bit crowded order a burger and truffle fries i order lettuce and tomato on my burger and they forget to give me that i ordered with the rest of my friends and they were 12 way done before my burger came then my fries were burnt i had to request for them to remake me a order as they became extra crunchy which i dont really care for the second batch they gave me was definitely better but i dont see whats the hype all aboutgood food poor service their staff doesnt seem to be trained very well   i found hair in my sandwich gross   every time we ask for extra salsa at the register they forget it and i have to go up to the counter and request it again   last time we were here we received our meal one of which was a soup they brought no spoon we were asked if we needed anything else and responded with an extra plate and a spoon  our waitress said she would bring a plate but that the spoons are self serve inside  so youre going inside but cant swing by the silverware while getting us a plate   i know where the spoons are we are local but maybe once we have sat down and gotten comfortable in a restaurant the least a server can do is accommodate uswhile the staff was nice however the service was slow and the food was middle of the line while the musician was okay not the sounds is not what i would have expected at was is labeled for a placed with jazz in the name   i had the sampler plate two of items were the worst representation of new orleans food i had ever  the reviews i read that said this was authentic creole and awesome musicim not sure we were in the same place   the bartender needs some speed and training on how to make drinks better   i would have stayed and had a few cocktails after my meal but they were going to charge me for entertainment i tell you what give me good food great music and i will give you the cover no questions askedsuch a let down compared to the original south philly location its not even close to the same cheesesteak the rolls are like wawa or subway baked 80 then frozen and baked to completion on location they are decent the meat is low grade steak em type meat and they barely give you any the original tony lukes is great tender meat that fills the roll not the case in mount laurel on its own it is probably slightly better than typical pizza places compared to the original tony lukes it is awful they shouldnt even call this place tony lukes because it cheapens the brand its a shameokmy last visit was way back in 2012 and i wasnt impressed   the coupon i received in the mail offering a free burrito lured me back   im still not impressed i even got the hot salsa and still no flavor here   i guess ill wait for their next crisis to returnthis was my second visit here  my first visit went off without a hitch not so much this time  i drove down from brooklyn to meet up with a girlfriend there  we arrived around 515 pm and were told that they only do tastings from noon5 pm  we were told that we could buy full glasses if we wanted too and that there would be live music shortly and pizza the lady went on further to explain that it gets really busy and they do not have the staff or time to dedicate to a full tasting after 5 pm  we told them that we didnt need the full breakdown and we know exactly what we wanted and they still said no  now the interesting thing is that a couple pulled up right before us and they were walking in while we were parking and we see that they are standing next to us doing a tasting  so now im pissed because they clearly walked in and got a tasting but we are being told something different  fast forward we got two glasses and took a seat  we were there until about 6 pm and wouldnt you know it they were still doing tastings with other couples that were there as well as the couple that walked in before us  i bought two bottles of the white merlot just because i had been raving about it to a friend  and wanted them to taste it  however i wont be going out of my way to return here again customer service plays a huge role in where i spend my money at and they failed me here  i realize they have a policy and but when you are blatantly ditching your policy for another couple but not for us i know its bs  in their defense i did not tell them that i came all the way down from brooklyn however i didnt feel the need to when i saw they were serving that other couple because they clearly had their minds made up  oh and from the time we walked in only 2 or 3 more people came in so it wasnt busy and there were about 5 people behind the counter and another handful of people coming in and out of the kitchen    i gave it 2 stars for the taste of the white merlot only  we also had the spumante secco  and ive had better tasting sparkling wine for a liquor store for half the price  my girlfriend wanted to taste the spumante rose but they didnt have any more of it  this is worth a visit if you are going to pass it but other than that go to new hope for the vineyards over there cheersin short this place would not come recommended from either of us it is a sit down burger place that serves subpar burgers were rating bagger daves slightly above working mans friend but below punch burger five guys and bru burger as far as indy burgers joints gothis is not nashville hot chicken  not even close  so if you are thinking you are getting something like princes hattie bs etc then dont eat here  nothing even close to nashville hot chicken but in all fairness maybe thats not what they are going fori wasnt happy with the sushi quality no flavor when i ordered the resturant just opened so i hope that was the reason why the sushi wasnt good the seafood soup was also flavorless and watered down  they do deliver so ill give them two stars instead of one would not recommend unless your desperate and dont feel like going out or paying fees for delivery services like  postmates if the fees dont bother you order from someplace elseive eaten from here twice  once for al pastor tacos and once for a burrito i was underwhelmed each time and i dont plan to ever go back both the tacos and the burrito were very dry the meat was minimal and overcooked   the staff is friendly and helpful but the food is just not up to par when there are usually other taco trucks nearby that are far superior imhothe waitress was friendly and efficient the home made potato chips were the best part of the meal my margarita was lacking in flavor but my friend said hers was good my sandwich was a disappointment as there was a lack of flavor the pork was large chunks not pulled and the brisket dry the sausage didnt look like it had been grilled kept putting bbq sauce on for flavor and moisture the outdoor fire pit had a  layer of cigarette butts but no appearance of a recent fire the saguaro rib ceiling lent to the southwest interior  there are dining tables outdoors that looked inviting the aroma of mesquite for the bbq was expected but not there my friends pork sandwich lacked flavor also she mentioned that the ladies room needed attention alsoi noticed that this place had changed hands when getting my hair cut so came back to give it a try  unfortunately i have to give it a mixed review  they tried real hard to make my daughters pizza including running to vons for more basil when they ran out    unfortunately none of us felt that making a cheese pizza and adding sliced tomatoes and basil to a fully cooked cheese pizza qualifies as a margherita pizza  i picked up a antipasto salad for the wife and it was a bed of lettuce with some pizza toppings piled on it and a tub of italian dressing  it was unquestionably the worst antipasto salad she has ever had  i had the chicken parmesan and i thought it was very nice  the chicken was cooked properly the sauce was flavorful and the pasta was good  every place has its good dishes and its not so good dishes and it seems we picked two of the latter  we go this plaza several times a week for groceries so maybe i will get up the nerve to try it again to see if i can find another dish they do as well as their chicken parmesan and not one as bad as their antipasto saladafter frequenting fresco pizzeria for over three years i consistently put up with the poor customer service occasional long wait times and undercooked pizza today was the final straw after not being told the total on my order i was then overcharged for my large pizza to top it off there was little to no tomato sauce on my pizza and i was left eating essentially cheesy bread poor experiencethe sushi here is less than fresh the 3 or 4 times ive eaten here  it is very expensive for a takeout sushi place  it also takes very long to get your order  there is nothing attractive or enjoyable about the atmosphere blahthe first time i came here it was interesting because it was new to me the second visit not so much decent spices arent a surprise as it is a pfchang company the problem here is that there isnt a lot of meat with the order you tend to run out of meat before you finish your rice or noodles spicy sauce is also limited and does not cover flavor all the rice or noodles so not bad but not great either consistency between preparations is also hit or miss at the same lunch visit my daughters meal hardly had any vegetables and they were all thinly sliced mine had huge pieces of vegetables all were thickly slicedi have been 3 times  all 3 times the ahi tuna was still semifrozen staff is friendly and topping are generic overall food is good but i wouldnt go specifically for the  tunawent there to get a steak sandwich for my daughter and the meat was nonexistent i literally was able to pull all the meat to one side of the roll so it looked like a sandwichthe excitement of this place has built as we anticipated a nice bbq place in the historic main street area so we went about a month after they opened to get some of their brand new restaurant issues out of the way   it was a sunday afternoon we were one of 4 tables seated the inside and the outside both have this amazing industrial feel that we love so that is a definite plus the waitress was extremely nice when we actually saw her the manager brought the whole crew together for quite some time to do some sort of meeting while we were still waiting on our first drink i think there could have been a better time to organize this meeting than leave tables waiting unfortunately the service did not seem to be any better after the meeting and like i mentioned they were not busy at all   on to the food my fiance and i ordered the pulled pork turnovers for an appetizer they definitely set the bar high for the rest of the meal btwstill waiting on my beer flight sampler at this time finally the main course is served   we ordered a slab of ribs and a pick 3 wbrisket turkey pulled pork we also had the macaroni french fries and green beans for sides i could break down the description of all of these but to save you time i would only order the pulled pork and the french fries again the rest of the food was dry andor had no flavor at all on to dessert we had pecan pie pretty sure it was thawed our store bought from the local grocery    this brings us to price we spent 64 before tip on food that we did not even finish due to taste not full bellies everything is ala carte so it gets pricey in a hurry i could not imagine the bill of the family with 3 kids sitting next to us it is a bbq joint but have definitely had better  will return for their drink menu one evening but the food will be left to the rest of the customers  needed info servicefriendly but mia most of the meal foodmediocre at best except for the pulled pork drinksthe beer flight and it was excellent will return for drinks only atmosphereawesomecame here for lunch today since we were in the area highly disappointing the food was pretty bland the chorizo burrito was covered in sauce and tasted mostly of melted cheese as did my wifes ground beef burrito the salsa was great but thats not a reason to come if you live in between this place and norristown head on over to norristown and get some flavorful and exciting mexican foodyogurt isnt my favorite but almost everything about this place is awesome   the decor is really bright and modern   the flavor selection has something for everyone brownie mix flavor snickerdoodle red velvet blueberry and many more lots of toppings you can go to the orange leaf web site to see the current flavors at this location  you pay by the ounce i would say that this is the most expensive frozen dessert place to which i have been it is right up there with cold stone  i dont think it is fair to compare ice cream and yogurt but i can compare places that are of a similar expense such as cold stone or pinkberry this is definitely not my favorite in terms of volume you do not get the same amount of product for the same price for 5 you are getting about half of the product volume that you would get at a place like cold stone also  since yogurt is lighter  it would not be unusual to eat the whole portion at the place  when i go to cold stone i typically buy the largest size and am full when ive only eaten 13rd of it i put the rest in my freezer and can typically enjoy it two more times thats a great deal for 5 cant say the same for this placesuper disappointed  our waitress seemed high on something she was sweet but couldnt retain any information we ordered a bottle of local wine and she served us wine from argentina   we werent sure why she didnt open it in front of us but trusted it was after we asked to take photo of wine because it was so delicious and wanted to support local wineries she then realized she gave us the wrong kind had to adjust bill and just super bummed because she was so scattered soup was fantastic and the buffalo cauliflower was excellent just drug test before you hireits really sad that i have to leave a bad review because the decor is cute and the front two baristas were nice however if im being honest their coffee and specialty drinks are mediocre at best  and too expensive for what it is  also the lady who i assume to be the boss bigger lady with dark hair and one of the workers an asian girl kept leaving the back door open near where we were sitting on a cold day despite us having shut the door after they left it open the first time i understand leaving the door open for minute to carry things in and out but they left the door open for a while just talking while the customers inside got cold we promptly left afterwards   if you want good coffee and good service i recommend tradestone which is just a few blocks down my friend and i wanted to try something new today but feine just does not comparein the slightest there are way better coffee shops with nicer staff close bythe south street night market aug 15 2013 was my 1st night market experience and quite possibly my last way too crowded ridiculously long lines and very few vegan options   i dont understand why people get excited about events like this where its too crowded to even really walk not for me  mehi was disappointed that the commons chose tim hortons as the retail space for their ground floor in the first place however i have given the shop several tries the coffee is good the breakfast sandwiches are fairly tasty the staff is usually perfectly pleasant the problem i have is that i have yet to get a correct order every time i ask for no cheese they add cheese to the sandwich today topped the cakei asked very clearly for bacon and egg on a bagel no cheese  what do i see once im at work sausage and egg on a bagel seriously how hard is it to tell the difference since theyve argued with me in the past  it didnt say no cheese  i see no point in wasting my time going back to point out their constant mistakes and only possibly getting a correct sandwich my only choice at this point is to stop frequenting this establishmentcame here for drive through one morning took about 25 minutes between waiting in line and waiting for food too long for a breakfast on the run been to better mcdonalds drive throughif your in a hurry this is not the place to come took 12 minutes from taking my order to getting my coffeemy boyfriend and i went here on a sunday night a little before dinner time   the host said it would be about a 20 minute wait for an outside table so we said first available is fine we waited at least 30 minutes anyways   you would assume that a restaurant on a pier would have excellent seafood right unfortunately all of our seafood was overcooked and bland my cioppino was ok but all of the seafood was dry and tough my boyfriends lobster pasta was bland and again the seafood was overcooked   definitely disappointed in the service and the foodfor those of you who follow my reviews you know my husband and i love dining at the hard rock cafes in each location we visit with that being said id have to say i was a bit disappointed with this particular caf lets start off with the service hubby and i ordered our drinks simple i ordered a coke and he ordered a captain and coke how long exactly does it take to get this when it is midnight and the caf isnt busy at all after waiting for what seemed forever we received the nachos we decided to share they were decent the next day we decided to go back to the cafe because we had a coupon i received from my hard rock rewards not only was the bartender barely attentive but she rudely asked if we had already used the coupon the night before which we didnt because i only had one  i was pretty disappointed in this cafe because of the service alone ive been to a ton of hard rocks in different states and for the most part the staff are always awesome this one not so muchno flavor far too expensive used the yelp checkin for their free breadsticks and i had to argue to 3 different kids before i paid for my 24 dollar pizza   the ingredients are higher quality than most but without any pizza sauce what do they expect me to taste better off getting takeout from scordatosif you like liquid smoke   ok food ok everything theres better around that is forsurethese burgers arent good in n out is way better and cheaper the fries are good thoi found adelaides through google i was looking for a special cake for my sons 1st birthday and didnt want to go the typical shoprite or acme bakery way now i wish i would have this place is expensivewhich i didnt mind at first i was holding a big party for my little boy with all our family and friends moonbounces etc when i called and talked to the girl who took my order i had no issue she was extremely friendly and helped me decide what i should get she knew i wanted specifically an elmo theme no big deal we pick the cake up that day looks nice not like the others i had seen on their website though before i had even gotten to bring it out in front of other guests with candles to sing to my son the whole cake caved in it looked horrible and i was embarrassed i also felt like a fool for paying that much money for a cake to fall apart and not even look nice for pictures and believe me i was extremely careful with this cake would not go back ever againunusually dirty for a starbucks from the sidewalk front door exterior trash  also the interior of the restaurant and restrooms need cleaned this location needs a deep clean inside and out open food container in the self serve cooler just not  what youd expect in such a nice area and of starbucksits always packed even during times that should be off what is the fascination   at least the service is semifast and the food is good by fast food standards but not worth the wait  avoid it like the plague unless you can figure out when theyre not busy  i cantthis restaurant has all the makings of a fine dining experience  unfortunately the food falls very much short of being mediocre  we attended with a small birthday party and they seated us in a very secluded and private spot so the beginning of the evening started off great  the server and staff were all extremely courteous and professional  the menu is fantastic with a fine selection of sandwiches pastas and american fare  they even have a nice adult beverage selection  i got the burger which was great but the entire rest of the family was very dissatisfied with their meal  the chicken marsala is almost laughable  the sauce has zero thats zero marsala taste and should be called gravy topped chicken and the salt is overwhelming  we ordered a side of kale and it was left untouched after the first taste  all 3 people who ordered the meatloaf found the special hot sauce to be complete uncharacteristic and simply bad tasting  for a disclaimer  my family likes to eat and rarely have a complaint about a meal so to hear so many complaints really emphasized how bad the food was  after a complaint the manager came and talked to us and was very understanding and unassuming but could only offer us free desserts  we took them up on it but even the desserts were bad no i wasnt having a bad day  the restaurant was  the brownie was brick hard and stuck to the pan it was baked in  the cookie was hard and tasteless they should take some salt out of the marsala and use it in their cookie recipe  ultimately the desserts showed up on our tickets but rather than cause more of a scene we paid the bill and left    the good  the scenery great staff great menu selection the bad speed of service the ugly  foodi hate to write how disappointed i was tonight with our experience at pagoda when i used to live in philly wed go often then after i moved to nj we would make the trip maybe once or twice a year to philly and choose pagoda for dinner the owners recognized us and had fantastic service and food see previous review   we were in town for the auto show and had decided to return to pagoda  after a long day on our feet we were glad to sit down somewhere familiar  we were seated immediately  put in our order by a somewhat hurried waiter a few minutes later the waiter came back and barked out no more peking duck that was a disappointment on a saturday evening not too late at night that one of their specialties was not available we did have shrimp dumplings which were decent  my garden vegetable udon noodle soup  his shrimp dumpling udon noodle soup which were as good as we remembered we got the orange chicken not spicy as our shared entree which was average but nothing special during this time we also heard a little girl crying loudly for 10 minutes until one of the owners i presume grabbed her hard by the arm yelling at her and taking her to another room to yell at her  hit her it echoed through the restaurant we did not want dessert left a 15 tip and while my husband was in the restroom i heard the waiter say to a girl behind the counter extremely cheap now i dont know if i heard correctly but that was pretty ballsy especially since we tried the peking duck rolls which were microwaved rolls with warm lettuce and bits of duck basically inedible they charged 6 which we didnt dispute we have no problem tipping well but he did not earn more than 15  especially given what he said oh well pagoda you lose our business to the peking duck house in north brunswick which is only 20 minutes from us so many restaurant choices in philly too and our loyalty is donenot coming here again just because its incredibly awkward i walked in for the first time and everyone stared at me it was made known i was a newbie there is only one table with an available outlet for a laptop charger and theres no way to connect to the wifi without going up and asking them how to do it the chairs at the tables are uncomfortable  i cant sit here and work like i had planned ugh just such an awkward experience ill stick to starbucksi like everything about this place but the food  owner is nice and polite menu has quite a few options but the taste of their food is something which doesnt appeal to me i have tried alot of their food every time i thought of giving it another chance but i sadly to have say that i did not find anything tastytoday was my first visit and i am less than impressed  i liked what i saw on the breakfast menu but opted for a lunch item instead  chicken cordon blu  the wait was average for take out but the person behind the counter seemed new and overwhelmed with the small amount of business me waiting to pay and order she just took and already forgot and a phone call that she took part of the order from and then told to hold   my chicken sandwich was not made the way it was described in the menu which made it not a ccb  it was served with a side of what i can only guess was the last remaining breakfast potatoes  not only where they not what i was expecting to receive with a lunch meal ordered at 11am but they were way overlooked some burnt and completely cold  in addition most of the pieces of potatoes were just small fragments of what used to be much larger pieces resulting in more of what could be described as potato crumble burnt potato crumble  burnt cold potato crumble  all of this came to almost 10 with tax  had i not ordered this meal as take out and left the area it would have definitely been sent back my first experience there left me feeling less than satisfied and ripped offokay i read there was a big problem with the service times   it took nearly 45 minutes for my wife and i to get our food we didnt even order anything complicated the people sitting next to us were also frustrated   my wife and i were excited to try it the place was packed there was a sign that said best breakfast in tucson in the front window   our server also looked very frustrated she barely came by to check on us and ask if we needed anything or wanted a refill because she probably seemed embarrassed   the food was brought out and at least it was hot the food was good but not great i brought the wait time up to the woman at the counter and she just said yeah it gets like that she gave us a 10 discount though   would i come back here nah would i recommend noordered a chicken caesar wrap soon after my stomach turned into knots i became very ill and had to lay in bed the rest of the day will not order anything besides a pizza from here again i dont trust their cooks when it comes to meat also their phone service is very short and rude their delivery drivers however have always been very pleasant   pizza and kind drivers is why i give a 2 star instead of 1i stumbled in here yesterday as i was riding my bike to work wanted a quick bite to eat and i was famished i have rode or driven by here a million times its right next to my barber and i frequent seven cups a lot as well so i thought i would give it a try  pj subs is wellleaves much to be desired the club sub was edible though the chopped meats tasted freezer burnt andor old the bar area that i ate in was very run down and dirty as if it had not been deep cleaned for a year or two and the stools were beat up could use some refreshing i did not expect a lot from this establishment and was not surprised by anything however what really become bothersome and annoying was the constant ringing of a buzzer going off from what sounded like the kitchen area on top of this they let the phone ring and go unanswered several times i understand staff may be preoccupied with other tasks but please just answer the phone and turn off your timers no one wants to dine with obnoxious noise distractions as those even if it is just a sub and beer placethis place was ok i guess  i have definitely had better coffee and the hot chocolate was way too sweetsimply putit is not the best korean fried chicken in town try wing chix and see the differencelove their soupshate their sandwiches    i have eaten here twice and both times got the bowl of souphalf a sandwich combo  the soups were both fantastic  one was the baked potato soup and the other creamy turkey and rice  the sandwiches on the other hand terrible  first time was the turkey artichoke which was nothing special but gave me terrible indigestion later  second time was the smokehouse turkey  the turkey was way too smoked and the ale mustard was so overwhelming that i couldnt taste anything else  my husband also got the steak and white cheddar special and didnt like it at all  hardly any meat on the baguette and what was on there was dry and crusty  pluses are the service is always very fast and the restaurant is cleanloud food was underwhelming my banana split was not a banana split and was mostly just chocolate ice creamgreat service disappointing food  my husband and i ate here recently on a layover due to the great priority pass deal and while the deal was great  the food wasnt quite so  we ordered the meat lovers pizza the toasted ravioli and the side salad  the toasted ravioli was okay  my husband didnt much enjoy it but i didnt mind it too much i did like the marinara that came with it for dipping  the salad was unremarkable  a standard salad  the pizza wasnot good the cheese wasi dont even know how to describe it it was like a goopy chewy mess i liked the meat on the pizza and the pizza sauce but ugh the cheese if you can order it wout the cheese maybe you should the crust of the pizza was a thin crust whatever maybe a little on the crispy side but honestly not too noteworthy good or badwhen it comes to subways the product is pretty much uniform across locations as long as they keep fresh buns and toppings on hand most of the difference i believe is when it comes to staff customer service cleanliness and the location  i came in one day for lunch when i was between meetings and in the area it was just starting to get busy for lunch so there was a bit of a lineup by just starting to get busy i mean there were 2 people that just finished paying and i was next and then 2 people behind me and people were starting to come in behind those people so by any means i wouldnt not consider that a huge lineup at all  my main reason for giving such a low rating is purely the dysfunctional layout of the store as you move down the line towards the till you are herded into the corner where the pop vending machine is and all of the eating utensils and essentials so this design pushes people into a tight corner where everyone is in each others way it is very uncomfortable to say the least it isnt a huge storemaybe 20 seats in total perhaps there must be a better way to lay things out to better control the flow of customers but it may take a bit of remodelling personally this dysfunctional layout would prevent me from coming back it is just too awkward and uncomfortable of a location hopefully they can remedy this at some point if so i may revisit and update my reviewthe day of our tour it was raining off and on but they didnt cancel which i give props for the tour lasted a little over 2 hours and we went to 4 places we tried gumbo jambalaya a brisket sandwich and a muffuletta the food was good i didnt care much for the jambalaya but every place we stopped at the people from the restaurant seemed like they hadnt gotten a heads up that we were coming so every time we stopped wed have to watch the staff scramble around as we waited for tables to be put together and food to be brought out it was odd we lost a few people along the way im not sure if they just left or the guide left without them id recommend a different food tour that offers more stops to get a better variety of food it was nice to get a tour around the city but its hes to take in the scenery when youre trying to keep up with everyone in the raindont get the smaller tavern burger its a different patty that taste like the 49 cents mcdonalds specialsirloin pulled pork  shrimp was average at best and mashed potatoes had dirt in itthe tacos are definitely good but overpriced its more like a 7 snack than a meal ive had them twice and the wait time has been around ten minutes both times a food truck should be both convenientfast and affordable neither of which west coast tacos is there seems to be a certain social  novelty hype to the whole ordeal that subconsciously tricks 20somethings into obsessively raving about the place   i was very excited about a food truck like this in indy especially one that utilizes social media to communicate with its customers however the price point and wait time compared to the relative simplicity of the product has left me disappointedterrible experience came for lunch on 212 arrived at 1230 sat on the patio sat at about the same time as two other tables sat for about 5 minutes with the last partys dirty dishes on the table waitress finally removed the dirty dishes and brought two waters didnt come back for another 10 to 15 minutes to take our lunch order ordered the pretzel buffalo chicken sandwich and peel and eat shrimp two of us we now waited for about 15 minutes for the pretzel an appetizer waiting 15 minutes and all it is was a frozen pretzel not that hard after receiving the pretzel and finishing it waited another 20 minutes for our food 20 minutes for a sandwich and a few shrimp which literally requires placing them on a plate about 4 tables that were sat around us at the same time or after we did received their food before we did i stopped the waitress who kept just walking by and asked what was taking so long she so stupidly said ill go check not sure whats taking so long food still didnt come out for another 10 minutes peel and eat shrimp were fine they werent for me chicken sandwich was disgusting so much grease it poured in my mouth the first and only bite the batter was undercooked and just falling off the chicken it was as if it was battered too much and just soaked in under temperature oil asked the waitress to send over the manager this is a key point here the manager acted dumber than the waitress literally seemed extremely unintelligent stuttering and mumbling uhhh ummm not really sure at one point he actually said uhhh well it is a fried chicken sandwich i mean really this is your manager this is your best guy on the floor shameful after mumbling he said ill take care of this for you and walked away never to return we sat there like idiots for the next 10 minutes without  the waitress or manager telling us we didnt have to pay this was the worst restaurant experience ive had in recent memory i will not return and i will not recommend anyone go herethey have excellent service lovely cashiers although they do not dog ice cream i took my dog in and they didnt even let her on with me i took her through the drive thru and i asked for their best dog ice cream and they started being really rude 010 ign would not recommend no quick scoopsfood was good but pricey for what you received decor was not impressive and men usually arent that observant no soft drinks were available as a drink choice for those who didnt want ice tea or lemonade or something distilled parking was abysmal in front only 15 spaces available by the building  not well thought out if someone needs handicap parking with louies basque corner next door that makes for a big lunch crowd all looking for a spot one of the members of our group had to park 2 12 blocks away because all the parking areas were full not a good option for a notsogood neighborhood doubtful we will go back30 mins wait for a simple cup needs better working sop cant believe that a disaster experiencei read the bad reviews and got worried  this was a off hours business dinner with coworkers and i wasnt looking forward to a case of food poisoning  i went over to citysearch to see if the opinions were bad all around and over there this place is raved about  this place didnt match up to the wonderful relaxed subdued atmosphere in amura orlando  i have never associated sushi with bad techno but ru sans doesnt let up  we were a group of 6 and sure enough the service for large groups is indeed bad  watch your receipt too  they put the gratuity on it already even though we all got seperate checks  i asked for mine back and changed the total  she wasnt that great  the sushi was really unremarkable and the wasabi pile was very small  i will say that the seaweed salad was delicious and at least twice the size of the one at amuras but serving it on a trifold paper towel as some kind of fancy presentation was really tacky  i wouldnt go back just because of the terrible music  it was all downhill from therei have never been to such a slow drive thru and thats comparing to other sss its literally at least a 20 minute wait just to order and thats at 10pm although i have gone to their takeout counter and waited just as long for cold food and a melted shake not sure why this location cant pull it off like others its really disappointing because its right by my housefrozen yogurt places have been popping up all over new orleans its becoming an overdone craze and also creates a lot of competition for a good review   id say that the yogurt at orange leaf was okay their flavors werent very exciting and i was escorted through my samplings  the server wouldnt just give me tasting cups she stood by my side and would put the yogurt into the sampling cups that i wanted to try  obnoxiously she would do it one immediately after the other trying to pass them all into my hands when i was obviously already holding one cup in one hand and my wallet in the other  she was impatient and rushing me through so i dont even really understand what i tasted  i do know however that what i tasted was not as good as the frozen yogurt ive had at other places like yogurtland or plum crazy  i think what also annoyed me was that i entered the establishment and waited around inside for about 8 minutes before someone showed up at the front counter  i actually thought they had closed but had forgotten to lock the doors  did i also mention that its extremely cold to sit in the store  so summary just okay yogurt toppings were okay as well and service was terrible  oh wait almost forgot  the yogurt consistency is soft maybe watery  so expect your yogurt to melt and disappear fast after you put some toppings on  btw for some toppings they force you take a certain amount instead of just a littleif it werent for the beer id give this 1 star good beer completely awful service the bartenders did not offer any education when it came to their beers and seemed like pouring me a beer was a nuisance but nothing came close to as bad as the chef in their small kitchen when my girlfriend asked how were the nachos he simply replied smugly theyre chips with cheese on them he then gave me a beeper and since my party was upstairs i asked how long the wait would be to see if i should just wait downstairs to which prince charming replied your food is ready when your number goes off disappointing experience since i think they have the best beer in stlexcellent food very good service  only two stars because dinner at least is outrageously expensive  27 bucks for a lamb stew that was definitely good but about the size of a bowl of cereal  i mean good or not its still stew  the kids moussaka was good as well but 22 bucks for 1 slice with a small side of khorabi  ripoffi should of listened to the reviews and saved my time and money very chaotic and of course the server got my order wrong too much of a wait to get it fixed15 stars   the only good thing about dining here is we got a 90min free parking with validation and their clam chowder unfortunately thats it   with all the good reviews my expectations were high it was a hot day and it was lunch time we didnt mind the long wait under the sun but the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive there were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list not good for the business definitely not good for waiting customers  crab cakes  if i didnt know what they were i wont be able to guess that they were crab cakes just a fishy patty of some sort  fried calamariscallopshirmps  they were cooked just right could have been perfect if they were not salty  rock crab special served with soup and salad  soup and salad were served first expecting they were cooking the crab after 20 mins we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away it was big at least the top shell underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size the top shell was even clean meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already also we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served cold not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge thinking we may have placed the order wrong we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold she acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated she came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab im not surprised that its still not warm what a waste of money   silverwares have heavy water stains looks very unsanitary forks were crooked we asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers good for them bad for us we will never come backi purchased a batch of these cookies and some of the cookies contained sayings from someone elses order  various orders it made handing out the cookies kind of scary since i never knew what someone would get when they cracked one open one of the sayings for example seemed to belong to a bachelorette party i contacted the company about four times via both email and telephone with absolutely no responseok food  horrible service  we stopped in for a late lunch on a sunday  we ordered the dan dan noodles braised beef noodle soup sichuan beef noodle soup doubled cooked pork and long pepper beef  the food was pretty decent but the service from the host to the wait staff was absolutely dismal  it took forever to get seated and even longer to get anyone to stop by the table and take our order  the place was about 25 full so there was no reason why the staff could not pay attention to us    forget smile with a service  i did really like the long pepper beef and if i want to try it again i will make sure to get takeouti appreciate the restaurants mission but the food just wasnt all that good   i found tace via google and decided to check it out even though it apparently hadnt been open very long it was a wednesday night so we decided not to call ahead to make reservations and it turned out to be a good call the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived so we were seated right away  the service was prompt friendly and professional i dont recall our waiters name was he was really nice he and the hostess took the time to tell us about the restaurants history and the mission behind it all turns out tace is a nonprofit organization all of the profits go towards a youth organization that is affiliated with taces owners   i ordered the new orleans collection which consisted of jambalaya crawfish touffe fried catfish red beans blackened red fish  gumbo i love cajun food being from a food capital chicago ive had the privilege of being able to enjoy authentic cajun food like one would find down south i have to say that the food i had at tace tasted unlike any cajun food ive ever had in my life  the jambalaya and gumbo looked and taste exactly the same i actually thought id received two of the same item and had the waiter check with the chef to make sure id received all the right dishes i was informed that it was indeed gumbo and jambalaya turns out it didnt really matter because i didnt really care for dishes anyway   the catfish was good as were the red beans with rice i cant really say i was especially impressed with the red fish though im not a fan of crawfish etouffee so i didnt eat it a friend of mine did and she said she thought it was okay  the ambiance was nice so that added to the experience the restaurant is nicely decorated with artwork from local artists all of the pieces can be purchased as well there were also salsa lessons being taught by a staff member while we dined dancing isnt my thing but it was fun to watch the others try their hand at it   i hate to say it but even with all the good stuff going on at tace the food doesnt warrant my making a return trip or even recommending itmeh they were really slow first to seat us more than 5 minutes and then to bring our food that said however my chicken strips were tasty and it was more than i expected as was my root beer floatnot 247 found that out the hard way at 3am  cant wait to try it when its open  hopefully the ice cream machine works toowe were looking for somewhere new to eat this evening and i happened to remember seeing the sign for this place opening last week we used to enjoy the restaurant that was in this building before five  diner so decided to give this new restaurant a try  little well nothing has changed about the interior of the place its still 1950s kitsch diner although the name and menu would be more appropriate to something country or rustic im not sure if the owners just didnt have the money or time to makeover the decor but it certainly is a mismatch theyve even kept the 1950s and early 1960s jukebox pop music which seems strange   we decided to order from their  all day breakfast menu michael chose an omelet with potatoes and english muffin while i chose the buttermilk hoecakes although they are actually pancakes with a side of bacon   the food was mediocre michaels omelet was barely warm and the cheese he asked for had just been melted over the top then allowed to sit so long it had firmed up again and congealed yes service was slow and undoubtedly that part of the order was sitting in the window his potatoes were ok although nothing particularly noteworthy   on my end the pancakes were a bit bland since i am currently dieting i decided to forgo the syrup and just use a little butter while they were not inedible by any means they just didnt seem to be quite worth the hefty 695 price tag for three pancakes alone the bacon however was tasty and high quality and prepared just as i had ordered it   the people seem genuinely friendly for the most part our server was a very nice older lady although i dont think waiting tables is really the career for her while pleasant she was rather inefficient and prone to forgetting simple things its also rude of a server to stand over the patron while they are filling out the charge slip and calculating the tip   this is one of those restaurants that seems just on the edge with a little more attention to the food some makeover in the decor and a bit more efficiency in the front of the house and the kitchen it could succeed however without those things im not sure of the longevity of this business normally in our neighborhood a new opening means a fairly full house for at least a few weeks when we were there only three other tables were in use and half the dining room was closed   well probably try it again in a month or so if theyre still open to see if theyve made any changes or progressgood baked goods but very rude staff i always try and make a trip to the bakery when i am in town from tx there are just some things you cant get in austin but after the rude service i received today i do not think i will be returning i will give my business to haydels and baums fine pastries its worth the trip to brsadly feine went downhill fast  at first it was such an adorable pleasant cafe but now it seems like they dont care about the customers experiencethursdays during lent are my burgers days so i decided to stop in to grab a cheeseburger and coffee milkshake  the burger was just okay 2 thin kinda dry patties and 2 cheese slices  i was kinda surprised at the size since they claim to be better than five guys  well umnot quite  the housemade chips were the saving grace they were fresh thickcut and crispy  much better than your lays or herrs  my milkshake was just okay it was decent but didnt really stand out  i actually would have much rather gone to baskin a few blocks down  so in summation come here for the chips and get your burger and shakes elsewhereate here for the first time today and it will be my last ordered a full order of ribs slab with two sides french fries and corn total was 2911 thats the most ive ever paid for ribs anywhere including rendezvous and corkys in memphis and any of the amazing places in kc   the ribs tasted good but were ridiculously fatty i asked for the sauce on the side and was given 1 tiny cup about the size of half a jello shot the tiny order of fries had pepper sprinkled on them wtf and i also ordered corn which i thought would be corn on the cob but nooooo it was disgusting frozen corn that youd get with your lunch in grade school no bread or texas toast or anything else to accompany the meal   when i walked in to pick it up the place had no one else in it but cussing bikers there is no way i will be back not unless every other bbq place in st louis closed and theyre the last dump standingi know the menu just changed to mexican today so i am way ahead of the game here and perhaps thats unfair but oe market should not serve mexican food  there was a ton of hype leading up to the market goes mexican release and yes i was excited but when you really think about it the mexican vibe does not go with oxford exchange they were blaring latin music and have added all sorts of pinatas and our lady of guadalupe candles around the place to make it all mexican  you can choose your protein choose your vehicle aka tortilla or whatever else you want and then choose three toppings they do not ask you if you want it for there or to go so im just assuming they make everything to go  i ordered the spicy pork belly taco with ancho sauce pico de gallo and blistered shishito peppers i waited for a little bit to get my taco but it was sort of busy so i didnt really mind there is basically no space to sit in the place and the guys in front of me had taken up the entire row so i had to eat outside no big deal   when i got the taco i was actually really disappointed youll see the picture and notice there is basically no pico de gallo on the taco at all the pork belly wasnt even spicy and was mediocre at best it had no flavor the pepper meh the ancho sauce was all over the place and although it tasted good it was basically the only thing on the taco that i liked  this is not oes specialty whatsoever the food at their regular restaurant is actually pretty good and i quite liked the sandwich aspect of the market because it truly felt like a market their juices are actually pretty good  their almond milk is a good blend and is made fresh   the market also has some refrigerated items to take home which looked pretty appetizing   but on the whole this new menu change is a recipe for disaster oe will get people going there with the hype but they wont keep them because these tacos are not good head to green lemon on south howard for better quality tacos packed full of flavor or go to miguels or anywhere else   i will go back and try more tacos unwillingly but solely for the sake of yelpi can only comment on the rum raisin but i was underwhelmed the consistency was very thin and the raisins had an unpleasant chemical flavor i was unable to finish a smallfirst let me say the two stars is really about reflecting on the dirty plates and silverware i had to weed through on my visit to this place with my 8 friends over the new year break i had to go ask the bartender for replacement clean plates for our dirty ones and then watched her sort through the stack in the kitchen for acceptable ones yikes   having said that the food tasted ok wouldnt write home to mom about it  but the patron margaritas were fab party on garthsorry for late review went about 3 weeks ago  disappointed  ordered two meat platter  pulled pork  brisket  pulled pork ok brisket was just like the pulled pork   pulled i was expecting slices of tender juicy brisket  it was a pile of pulled meat the sides  slaw and potato salad have a lot o be desired  the corn bread is like a piece of stale cake it was nothing but crumbs  sauce good stuffservice was fast  theres a full bar  my wife had their summertime gimlet based on cumber infused gin  very nice but pricey for a cocktail  on tap beers werent that good    the prices were high for bbq on a metal platter  my wife  i both had bbq sandwiches  the rolls were a bit dry and on the small side for the price  meat was good but again the sandwich was smaller than id expected  the sweet potato fries were plentiful and tasty  my wife didnt care for the cole slaw  the beans were good but skimpy  i liked the sweet potato and pecans  we split a blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream  great ice cream ok cobbler  it was fresh baked and large but needed some more sweetness  the atmosphere was nice  downstairs music was just starting up  judging by the full parking when we left the place was probably rockin later onwill not eat here again i must admit i have had some very nice meals here in the past their basil chicken is very good tasty and nice bit of spiciness last night we ordered basil chicken and kung pao chicken could not eat it the kung pao was tasteless and the meat was absolutely horrible not one piece of chicken was edible grizzle and chewiness in every bite basil chicken still tasted good but the chicken was the same as the other dishthe food is pretty darn good but the service is awful i work close and have taken my team here many times by of convenience but we continue to get bad service from the time your order until the time you receive your food this location closed down for months but cant tell that they remodeled and they certainly did not train their employees in customer servicei thought over this rating for quite some time and also ran it by my boyfriend who accompanied me here this morning  i was hesitant to rate this at 2 stars especially due to the other reviews that came before me 4 stars 5 stars etc which by the way was why we came here in the first place rather than going somewhere else  im going to start right off the bat with what i and my boyfriend ordered  i ordered a cappuccino i have been ordering them everywhere lately so i base my experience on everywhere else in fishtownno libs that offers a cappuccino and my boyfriend ordered his usual plain iced coffee he orders it even in the dead of winter so hes tried an iced coffee all over as well  ill get to the point my cappuccino was eh it tasted burnt and unpure  im no coffee connoisseur but i do know a good cup when i taste one and this wasnt it  my boyfriend said his iced coffee tasted watered down and unremarkable  he ordered an everything bagel with butter and i just opted for a yogurt because thats what i was in the mood for  the bagel was also eh and the butter literally tasted like nothing not sure if thats what theyre going for or not but it was unremarkable as well  all in all thats exactly our experience this morning unremarkable  i hate leaving reviews like this because i want to give places the benefit of the doubt and maybe we just didnt order a good signature coffee that theyre known for or maybe we should have tried a pastry but i had to go by the rating system and since i went by the rating system the experience was meh ive experienced better  the prices are better than other coffee shops in the area but that doesnt mean the quality should lack  id rather pay the extra couple of bucks for a really truly good experience   and when i talk experience i am not just referring to the food and drink  the establishment itself was meh water stains on the ceiling signifying a leak of some sort not something to take lightly and overall the interior decor was just shotty  granted the floor was clean always something i look for the service was polite but not out of their way friendly the utensils were clean and there werent any bugs floating in my drink but at 2 stars as yelps rating states my experience was all around meh  sorry reanimator i left your place unanimated and unimpressedwe got the menu at mail and tried the opening sale we ordered a lunch special  3 rolls teriyaki beef and a fried gyoza the teriyaki beef came with a lunchtruck shitty box and it was lacking flavor and sloppy the beef was kinda rubbery too the sauce seemed like it was squeezed at last instead of mixed well with the dish the sushi was bad especially compared with what i usually get from other places we found this see pic in the sushi and have zero idea what that is the delivery guy was friendly and on time i guess thats the only thing we were cool withso i will say that a few of the things i have had from here have been really good  however my friend who loves this bakery was celebrating a birthday and i ordered his cake from here  i had it flat on the floor of my car and live only a short distance from the bakery  before i left the bakery it looked great  when i got home and opened the box the whole top layer of the cake had cracked in half  when i called the bakery they offered no assistance in fixing this problem other than to pay for another cake i am not sure why this would happen but when i spend a lot of money on a cake it would be nice if it looked presentable   so  i would say that while their baked goods may taste yummy if you are looking for reliable customer service  go somewhere elsenot worth the wait the drink i ordered was watered down probably from the chopped ice that was in the drink when seated we were served four waters we dont know why decor was excellent floors need work and the tables were very bland when the food came it looked decent way to much chocolate on the pancakes and hash browns were mediocre food was only decent shoneys would have been betterzero benefit to ordering ahead you still have to wait in line with everyone else when you get there and my drinks werent even madeim a big fan of dives but this was just dirty looking  i didnt even want to touch the doors to enter   everything had a nasty layer of greasy scum  food was good thoughi do not like to give a bad review but it is necessary for improvements we got our salads served in veryvery hot bowls straight out of the dishwasher this is what the waitress claims and then she giggledaubreyreally my salad was wilting faster than i could eat it low inventory of dishes  i am used to 45 star restaurants that serve salad on a chilled platethis is normal my mother was a chef and owned her own place and this would have never left the kitchen  its a training issue  i know i should not expect the best in every place i dinebut it does make a difference as to weather i am coming back or not i absolutely love salad and expect it chilled and this just did not stand up and make me say wow the pizza was tasty and the crust was grilled very nice underneathtoppings were good and the presentation okhad to ask for the pizza shakers though what can i say its a bar dont order salad try something elsethis review is for breakfast i stopped in for a coffee and bagel while waiting for my car at firestone next door the bagel was frozen and a little mushy and the coffee was just ok they gave me a tiny packet of cream cheese and wanted to charge me 50 for another packet which i thought was crazy after paying 4 for a coffee and reheated frozen bagel   the woman working behind the counter was very sweet and we both agreed that the best coffee in town is kaldis just a 2 minute drive from here  i wouldnt come back here for an actual meal but im giving it 2 stars because im happy theres a place for me to sit and have a coffee while waiting for my carmy waiter was very friendly but thats about as good as it got i ordered the signature grilled cheese sandwich which comes with bacon and apple slices what i got was two pieces of bread with a slice of cheddar melted on them with apple slices and 2 pieces of bacon thrown between them every time i tried to take a bite  the apples and bacon would slide out from between grilled cheese should be a cohesive whole with the bread slices held together by cheese and this was definitely not   i then ordered the apple and blueberry crisp beyond the fact that it had strawberries and not blueberries it also was very bland the crust was also less a crisp and more just uncooked oatmeal that was warm and soggy  my friend s pound cake was also bland   they have great ideas in terms of the menu but they could benefit from a head chef who understands the basics of food  construction and spicingthis was the first ethnic restaurant i ate at in tucson many years ago i had heard that it was serving kurdish food and i was excited to try it as i have eaten very delicious kurdish food homemade meals in phoenix  kurdish food is actually more gourmet the dishes can be very complicated and the flavors are complex i tried their pillaw a thin puff pastry type shell stuffed with cubes of beef chicken rice and very delicious seasonings when i told my friends kurdish in phoenix that i had tried pillaw they were very jealous saying they had never made that particular dish this was truly a gem of a restaurant 14  years ago the most recent time i ate there pillaw along with some of the other more ethnic kurdish dishes had been taken off the menu instead it seemed to be more like a typical middle eastern type restaurant offering mainly gyros for the entree another disappointment was the change from authentic kurdish music to heavy rocka type of music played more for the enjoyment of the young servers it seemed than for customers seeking something unique or different in essence i wish them well but it seems they have lost their way if they were to go back to their roots it could be a very delightful restaurant againwe tried cafe fleur de lis on our recent trip to new orleans using the factors of atmosphere taste and pricing i was quite underwhelmed by this restaurant  i ordered the cobb salad for lunch it was 13 not a crazy price but high for a salad  the base of the salad was your basic bag lettuce you could pick up at any grocery store i literally felt like they had cut open a plastic bag of lettuce and dropped it into my bowl then they topped it with standard items there was absolutely nothing special about it  i always want to have something at a restaurant that i cant easily make on my own at home there was not one thing about the preparation of this meal that made it unique in any waythey limit your drinks not only that but bought a jalapeo mcchicken isnt it suppose to have jalapeos  my fries were oldthe food was greatbut they ran out of biscuits and corn bread the service was horrible really slow and the waitress seemed scared not sure whats going on today but i am disappointedwe tried this restaurant after reading the good reviews  i now realize they must have been written by the staff service was mediocre at best staff seemed disorganized and lost i dont think there was a manager on duty soup of the day  shrimp corn bisque was very good happy hour tacos were tasty rice on the  other hand was the worst ive ever had possibly canned  wont be backburger was lame  crinkle fries undercooked and tasteless  damn good shake though  waaay over pricedi really like this place the burgers are great a little small but very good the beer selection is good and as everyone says the homemade catsup is awesome  the big problem here is that is is so damn expensive   12 for a tiny burger then another 24 for fries dont get me wrong the food is very good its just not good enough to justify their priceslet me start out by saying i really want to like this place really they are in my neighborhood they have a lovely patio and serve alttacos however i still cant give them a wholehearted endorsement for a couple of reasons most importantly the disparity between their portions and prices im not looking for lardbutt size meals but when you charge 250 per taco you expect them to at least be filling make them larger or drop the price even a slight drop could reconcile the difference and if you charge for chips they should be good really good   as for the taste itself ive found them to be ok the issue ive found is that everything is a little bland when you say spicy at a mexican even be it altmex you should mean spicy the tacos ive tried with a creamy sauce are overwhelmed by the mayolike taste and consistency  one thing they are tops at is the speed at lunch cant vouch for dinner its always too busy for me to bother given my past experiences ive got my food within minutes of ordering iti have dined at baguette deli a handful of times in the past with my most recent visit being after nearly a year since the previous one during prior visits i had always been pleased with the value and quality of the food as well as the prices unfortunately it seems the place has changed   first the girl taking my order at the counter seemed hurried and became visibly impatient when i took an extra few moments to decide my order even though there were only two other customers in the restaurant and no one else in line i have always enjoyed the fresh shrimp spring rolls but was disappointed to find they were out in the past they had been able to make them to order if customers were willing to wait but when i asked about this the girl responded with a terse no and seemed to take pleasure in being unhelpful so i settled on the teriyaki chicken banh mi although the bread was crusty and delicious and the veggie toppings were fresh the chicken was mushy salty tasted old and had the texture of a pure rather than actual meat in addition the meat portion was minuscule which i was somewhat grateful for in this instance because it simply wouldnt have been palatable  while eating my lackluster sandwich i overheard the conversation between a customer and the girl at the counter while placing his order the customer inquired about the same fresh spring rolls i had been interested in the girl told the gentleman they were out but when he asked about having some made to order she said yes after she had given me a flat unapologetic no   despite already being furious my next and possibly most significant issue with baguette deli is that they no longer offer free water to customers which i am reading is a complaint i share with other reviewers instead of a pitcher of water with reusable plastic cups that diners could help themselves from the restaurant now requires patrons to purchase an overpriced bottle of water i find this practice cheap greedy and in the worst possible taste and service despite relatively reasonable base prices and good experiences in the past the new nickeling and diming tactics inconsistency and poor customer service has made baguette deli a place i no longer wish to give my patronage tothe guy was great he was a good server  server we are know for our uni he brag bout it then after i order he said we only have it on weekends   remove it on your weekday menu if you only have it on weekends   other than that nothing special except its byob   ambience was good its located on the belt of passyunk restaurant streetthe food is good but this experience had the worst service waited for basically 30 minutes to get our changecards back from our waitress while we could literally see her just talking with other tables about her fanny pack pins super disappointed and a real waste of my time  update now it has been an hourit may be the best in stl but there is much better q 313 miles ne in chicago try smoque bbq the next time you travel to the windy cityi had high expectations from reviews but was disappointed they didnt have anything too interesting my food was served barely luke warm and needed a lot of salt however the pancakes were pretty good and the servers were niceok so i love the fact that they have organic food that doesnt have chemicals but one they are overpriced two i had a slice of pizza and broccoli rabe and they were both horrible i went in there today to buy berries and i was looking at the containers to make sure i get a good one and the produce guy clearly got annoyed that i was moving them and basically took one from my hand a small container is 6 or more so as a customer i have the right to make sure the berries are fresh im going to find another organic store with better pricesokay i must be missing something  there is no question the chicken is crispy but thats it it was devoid of any seasoning and other than ketchup and siracha there were no sauces to help it along   the only flavour i got was oil from the fryer dont get me wrong it wasnt really greasy just no flavour 950 for a wing drumstick and part of a breast and fries not even a jug of water to fill a glass up to wash down the oil flavour tried once wont bother trying againi want to like the helena bakery but they dont offer the yummy bakery items they provided at lucky penny so i miss lucky penny because they had better food i especially miss the wood fired eggs and financiers every time we order for here they give us our drink in to go cups and it takes a long time to get the drinks today the music was really bad late 70s early 80s music im done with this placehave gotten a few cakes for birthdays and such well in fact several over the years the last three have been less than yummy this last one the cake it self was dry very dry  guess it is time to find some place else huhi would give the food a 4 star so if you want delivery or pick up definitely come here the food was great and the cook was wonderful this review is on their bartender and set up this business is split half and half one side is a bar and one side is a pizzeria no one was on the pizza side when we came in and so we sat on the bar side we just wanted pizza the bartender greeted us as we came in we went to sit at a table and she said why do you come sit at the bar we didnt reply yet and she says yah youll sit up here then we tell her we want to sit at a table and under her breath she says whatever you get better service at the bar so we sit down and she asks us what we want to drink and we say water and lemonade she looks at us crazy and repeats our drinks back to us rudely we get up and walk to the other side we didnt want a bar experience while we were there to eat pizza so she follows us over and says why did you leave we told her we just wanted to sit in the restaurant side she goes to our new waitress and says have fun with them our new waitress was good  then this same bar tender comes over to the pizza side yelling to the cook saying you cock sucker and fuck you really loud it was sooo annoying they have this place set up so you can dine in or go to the bar it was awful this bartender ruined our dining experience we were there at 9pm on friday to eat pizza and we were not at the bar drinking and this was our experience the food is great the cook is great order take out or delivery do not dine in do not bring your kids in i cannot speak for the bar services just the pizzeria sidedisappointing  maybe i wouldnt have been disappointed if i hadnt been under the impression it was going to be more like a farmers market not basically just a bunch of long lines to a bunch of lunch trucks i got there late thinking it goes until 10 and my friends inform me that if the food hasnt run out then itll be an hour wait for me no thanks   it had a lot of potential to be cool there was music and i saw a lot of people i knew but there was nothing to do but stand in line or stand around  mehpeople dont come here for coffee so take that out of the name its a cafe  had a blt terrible i paid money for that hard like a rock  recommendations decrease the size of you menu selection items focus on 10 items only  get real good with those  the gentlemen behind the counter were pleasant wouldnt called them baristas but nice  helpful  wifi was good 2mb average  couple outlets throughout the roomworst quiznos ive ever been too they have the 5 daily specials and i work nearby so this is a decent deal the issue is they refuse to add sauce to any sandwich when its part of the 5 special example i want alfredo sauce instead of mayo lettuce pickles tomatos and olives and whatever sauce it typically comes with they refuse no exceptions they rather make no sale than give me a little sauce ive walked out twice due to this  whoever runs this place is a complete fool i always remove 100 of veggies which has to at least equal the cost of the sauce ive debated this on 3 visits and i refuse to step foot into this store again   last visit they sold me alfredo sauce on the side for 40 cents  but refused to put it on the sandwich  i asked for all the veggies on the side and threw them away untouched the can give me all the veggies in the world but cant give me 3 cents worth of sauce ive never experienced such horrible service by people who apparently have no common sense  i would eat here 3 days a week and now i rarely go most of the employees are great its only 2 of them who give me issues i will go there if certain people are working it just really sucks they are so stubborn over something that shouldnt even be an issuewent for lunch with a colleague  had the dry hot chicken  it was some kind of overly deep fried pieces of something for lack of a better word i didnt see much chicken if any  it could have been deep fried pieces of chicken fat for all i know  it had a decent enough hot peppery taste but what was in that fry i dont know  the egg roll came out cold on the inside  the won ton soup consisted of 2 won tons in a light broth  overall i do not know how they made the cnn  top picks unless it was for their philly location and they used that to franchise or extend to some strip mall in extondolce is a new restaurant in the recently added shopping plaza near the oaks theatre weve been looking forward to trying it since we first saw the sign go up   unfortunately our visit was very mix the decor is really nice they had beautiful lighting nice tile floors and the tuscan villa mural was very pretty then they had naked statues that tackyed up the place a bit   we arrived before our friends and waited about 5 minutes before we even saw one staff member when the hostess appeared she did apologize for the wait but since we had 4 in our party a table had to be cleared in the meantime our friends arrived and so did 3 other parties behind us we waited about 10 minutes for our table we joked that they were making it from scratch   our service was good although a bit under experienced i asked what pasta came with my meal and he said penne it ended up being spaghetti noodles   now to the foodthe portions were huge and had a price tag to match the salads were drenched with salad dressing i ordered their chicken parmigiana and it was not good ive had better at an irish restaurant in reading pa thats saying a lot   jeff ordered their homemade fettuccine alfredo the noodles were soft and tender they really looked like those no yolk egg noodles in the grocery stores the homemade noodles saved this review from being a one star   for four people our bill was 85 which is a bit absurd for underwhelming food i really hope they can up their game because it could be a nice byobi came into the minute clinic with my 2 and 4 year old boys we got in line at the kiosk in hopes of being seen  while the kiosk seems convenient at first the elderly man in line ahead of us took over thirty minutes to sign in multiple times i had to assist him because there was nobody around to notice or offer any help the system required him to enter an email address and he didnt have one  when it was finally our turn to sign in we found that there was only one appointment left and we needed three the next appointment was for an hour and a half later   by this point my boys were quite unhappy and loud we decided to leave and find somewhere else run by amateurs they need robert or chef ramsey to teach these amateur how to run a restaurant not only i waited 30 minutes to get my order i waited another 30 to get my food and it was the wrong order waited another 15 for my familys food we were seated after 738 and didnt leave til 945pm  granted we meet the coowners daughter waiting for a table so i figured food must be really good for even she has to wait for a table service was 1 star not even a refill of water our waiter need to go to real restaurant to see how real waiter wait  now the food if it arrived hot and not cold if it arrived all at one time if the staff worked as one instead of standing pretending to work maybe  i was disappointed most of the reviews here noted service was so sothey werent lying the food was good i have to say but so is applebys on a bad daybelow average pricey thai restaurant with a full vegan menu    visited on 12217 at 5pm  i must have passed by this place a hundred times and never noticed it which is ludicrous because the sign on the outside of the building is absolutely enormous and they have a unique round entryway around the front door it sits in a small strip mall next to a consignment store and a laundromat    inside its rather uninspiring with plain tables and clutter  it is one of those sketchy looking places where you want to order something safe if ya know what i mean we were seated very quickly and service was fast and friendly  4157 got us a seafood entree a chicken satay appetizer and a kids meal   i got the 795 chicken satay appetizer which came with four chicken skewers a bowl of peanut sauce and a bowl of cucumber salad  the cucumber salad was fantasticchock full of fresh jalapenos and onions and fresh cucumbers  the peanut sauce was a little bland but a very generous portion  the chicken skewers were yellow hard dry flavorless and barely room temperature  i am certain that they were cooked either yesterday or earlier today and reheated  for the price id expect some freshly cooked chicken    my son got the 995 kids chicken pineapple fried rice which came with apple juice and a spring roll  i do not like paying ten dollars for a kids meal at any restaurant but i will say their portion was enormous  they give 34 times more than any child can possibly eat  it was the best thing i tried tonighthot and fresh and well seasoned i found it unusual that it was smothered with fried onions which i wouldnt think is very kid friendly  my advice would be to cut the portion in half and lower that price and nix the onions   also the meal was supposed to come with a dessert which they never brought out   i watched in horror as my husbands dish arrived  he had the 2095 seafood basil delight which the menu said had shrimp calamari mussels and scallops stir fried with basil and onions and an herbal sauce  what arrived was a plate full of green peppers onions calamari shrimp and mussels  the scallops were missing and the green peppers were not on the menu description  this is not the sort of place where i would order something like this but my husband is a brave man  he said hed give it a 4 out of 10 and that it was hot but bland    the prices here do not match the quality of the food  serving old chicken is absolutely unforgivable  i would not go backi have tried this place a few times over the years and i have either been disappointed or found that it was just okay  not authentic  not enough flavor  sauces decent but not good  no wow dishes or anything memorable  not going back any time soonspoke to owner on phone i was struggling to find a menu online he pointed me to grubhub to find the menu i ordered the chicken parm over spaghetti a chicken salad sandwich and a grilled chicken gyro i was feeling hungry   the chicken parm had a good sauce the chicken was tasty but it looked of rather low quality think 1999 mcdonalds chicken mcnugget the gyro was overfilled with the sauce  it was dripping everywhere and the chicken that was used on that similarly looked  fake it tasted okay but within 30 minutes i did not feel  i see why this place has such high reviews  food tastes good least the chicken parm did and my order was ready within 15 minutes  impressive but the food quality in my opinion is really poor  i will not returnwoohoo first review sadly this will be a review for the crappiest place i ate at in reno  i wasnt expecting much from a casino but somehow my hopes went up when i saw that the two chefs in the asian part of the restaurant were actuallyasian there is a wide selection of dishes that actually cant be found at any other chinese fast food place props for that the whole restaurant itself also has american food and i believe mexican but i dont quite remember  anyway back to the food all of the ingredients are already prepared and are out for the chefs to use sort of like at subway one guy puts it all together and the other cooks it i ordered the cashew  almond chicken which also had some vegetables with it and came with some rice the first chef put everything together and gave it to another guy to cook however he threw it in the wok let it warm up for 30 seconds and thew it on the plate i was expecting some actual cooking maybe some soy sauce garlic any spices nope nothing  after trying the dish i almost didnt want to eat it anymore but i had no choice the nuts were plentiful which i enjoyed thats what she said however the whole dish was just ridiculously bland and tasteless there actually wasnt that much chicken and the vegetables consisted a large portion of the dish  a cheap place on the bottom floor of a reno casino i didnt expect much in the first place but any restaurant can do better especially this onegenerally im a fan of produce junction the concept of fresh produce for less is a no brainer even if i have to buy 20 bananas for 2 ill buy them and give half away its still much cheaper and better quality than what id get at acme   but this location has issues it has a cramped parking lot that is overflowing at peak times but most distressing a lot of the produce youll find here is past its prime or worse spoiled or moldy since much is prebagged youll often only find this out when you reach home and unpack your purchases   if you are going to shop here check everything closely before you leave its a hassle to return and they seem to have no procedure in place for dealing with returns and complaints and do follow the math as the attendant adds up your purchases they are often wrong usually overcharging  cash onlyi really wanted to love this place but i dont   im giving them two stars because i liked their fried rice but i cant order that every time i goi need the healthier options to taste betterdinardos famous seafood has been a philly tradition for thirty five years and specialize in crabs which are flown in year round from the gulf waters to ensure a year round supply plus they claim the crabs are larger and more meaty ill give them larger but if this is what you call meaty the pickings are pretty slim i actually burned calories trying to eat these things  our server linda was a gem she was friendly helpful and knew how to guide us through the menu as this was our first visit five big shiny stars for her service the food however was a different story   hubby started with a bowl of clam chowder which was loaded with potatoes and tender clams but nothing else the consistency was good however it really lacked in flavor it needed so much more perhaps onions celery i stirred in one pat of butter  paula deen approved  a little salt and pepper and that still did not do the trick so i repeated this same procedure but it really did not help  philadelphia is known for snapper soup but this tasted sour the meat was tender and plentiful and a poor quality sherry was served on the side we each took one bite and decided we would pass the crab imperial stuffed mushroom caps were okay but expensive four small mushroom caps and i do mean small were filled with the imperial for ten dollars  my two pounds of garlic crabs were all work and no play but plenty of messing around trying to get out the minimal amount of meat i was tempted to pick up those babies and start sucking the meat out of them no more blue crabs for me ill stick with the dungeness snow or alaskan crabs from now on better yet saute me some pure lump crab meat in a little garlic and butter i will give them this the garlic and red pepper sauce was outstanding they should bottle it  hubby had the seafood imperial with crab scallops and bay shrimp which was a very rich but small portion and we both agreed it not only smelled very fishy but tasted fishy as well after two or three bites we decided to bring it home for the cat but she was not thrilled enough to eat it either  they have a full bar and a happy hour my margarita was not very good mostly bottled margarita mix the hostess was not very friendly well she was okay with us but i had to giggle when two young girls moved from a table to a booth and she screamed at them  you can not just seat yourselves  i did not see what the big deal was they were not very busy however with them pushing together many tables throughout our meal it was obvious they were planning on some large parties arriving soon  all in all linda rocks what a sweetheart the place is a little worn down from wear and tear the food is below average in my opinion for the prices they chargei thought the wings were small like wings you get from the italian market reflecting on it they probably were the size a normal chicken wing should be im just use to chicken with hormones that are twice the size the macaroni and cheese lacked flavor  the yams tasted like they came from a can  meh ive experienced betterso i had to give it a 2nd shot because i really want to love and support a local bbq place but once again its just not worth it this time around i had the fried chicken the new bradford sandwich collard greens mac n cheese  and mashed potatoes the biggest winner was the fried chicken as most people have agreed with the mac n cheesethickest buttered noodle combo ive ever had it was like eating a ball of flour mixed with some noodles the mashed potatoes were just what it says mashed potatoes the collard greens were loaded with vinegar which might work for some but not me it also had slices of garlic which for me made me tentative on biting into a slice and getting blown away with it the bradford was decent as the pork had a nice smoke flavor but the chicken was dry and couldve used more sauce or jalapeo unfortunately i cant give it another chance definitely prefer some bbq down on the boulevard like mission or famous davesmy love hate relationship with whole foods goes on seriously wtf is up with not providing nutritional information youre a chain this shouldnt be that hardbooming business in a fun setting and location shrimp taco a big dissappointment row of 3 medium sized boiled shrimps on a skimpy bed of cabbage with a no taste white sauce rubios is 5 times better at 13 the pricei have eaten at this establishment several times and i have been left feeling unsatisfied almost every time normally i go to this location as its the closest to my house but i think i might have to find a new establishment the employees always seem to be nice but they really arent very accommodating it seems like every time i go there they are out of one or more flavor and the employees are pretty slow to refill them also their fruit selection is awesome when its available and once again it seems to be hard to keep it stocked as they are out of at least one type of berry every time and there isnt a sense of urgency to refill them i will say that the employees have been very cordial and nice at this location but just not very helpful frozen yogurt has been stellar though and i love the cookie dough and the hot fudge hopefully the upkeep on the flavors and the toppings can be improved as this would significantly bring up the ratingthis foodery is dingier than the 2nd street location but closer to restaurants in cc easier to stop by before going to restaurants due to the limited space it can get really crowded in the store so if youre claustrophobic avoid it but my general feelings towards the establishment do not change from the 2nd street location to this onethat is the place is just too damn expensive you can easily pay average bar price for bottled beer without the bartender they have really cute cats hanging out in the store so thats a little better than a real bar i guessi almost fell off my chair reading the reviews for this store gone down hill since raleys bought it the store is dirty and disorganized apparently these folks were never in here before raleys bought it it has never been clean or organized these types of stores cater to a specific clientele and minimal staff and stock help keep prices down if you walk in here expecting raleys you will definitely be disppointed it does have pretty good prices and selection on produce which is about as far as i venture in any morethe food was great i had the fried green tomatoes loved the sauce and a burger my requested mw looked more welldone but it still tasted good my problem was with the service it was so bad it was almost comical our server forgot everything we asked for immediately we were missing a water glass when we sat he forgot we ordered drinks and he only brought 2 he forgot to go get the shake which we saw melting at the ice cream bar and a tea we ordered apps upon arrival asked for plates to share and he literally walked away and was checking his appearance in the mirror right next to the kitchen i finally went to ask for the tea and plates so we could begin eating our food arrived and our side of fries was missing we asked for them never received finally we asked him to remove them from our check and charge our card receipt returned with the charge for fries i was flabbergasted we still tipped him 20 because i have worked in the service industry and i understand it isnt easy but dude maybe this job isnt for you ironically he was training a girl that night while i would definitely go back here for the food i really wouldnt because i just cant enjoy a meal when service is this badas a frequenter i had high hopes as the west nashville and midtown location are our favorites i always get pbms nitro it was kind of flat along with the other ipa we got one of the things we love about tailgate is the personable service the bar service was equal to going to broadway order get the drink and they walk away after you get it im not expecting a full conversation but some interaction would be nice especially since its a new location hey how are yall have you been to tailgate before would you like to sample anything this is what we have new you should try it basic restaurant conversation we got none i would have asked for a new beer if it didnt take having to reach over the counter just to flag down the bartender in order to order our pizza for which we got charged 199 for swapping a meat that we do at other locations with no charge pizza was lacking toppings too i would suggest yall get on the same page for every location i dont mind paying extra for ranch when its homemade like other locations but not a fan when its from a jar we just hurried up and left to go elsewhere dont think yall were ready to open yet maybe we will come back in 6 monthswhile the service was friendly the raised voices of two employees distracted me from the work id brought there to do  they were louder than ive ever heard employees be in a restaurant  my coffee was good and my bagel was deliciously toasted  but i doubt ill be backi was realllly excited for this place to open i walked by day after day waiting for when id be able to try their soups salads and sandwiches when that day came i was largely unimpressed the sandwich was just ok and kind of skimpy my soup was actually pretty darn good but i found the entire meal to be overpriced for what i received the sandwiches overall are kind of uninspired i can pay the same price and get a delicious one at dibruno bros a few steps away i hope they are able to rework the menu a bit because id really like to love this placethis is hands down the worst mcdonalds i have ever been to while i do not fault the establishment for the unsavory characters that hang out in and around it a given considering its location i do fault it for the extremely negative attitude of its employees none of them make even a minimal effort to hide their annoyance at the mere presence of paying customers they act as though you are ruining their day by politely ordering food and paying for it the only reason i gave two stars instead of one is because the nuggets and fries were decently fresh   i understand that working at mcdonalds in a place like that is probably nobodys dream job but if you cant have an positive attitude in that job dont expect to end up with anything much better as your life goes oni always enjoy my burrito but the tables chairs and floor in the dining area are always dirty and disgusting the area is small and its not appetizing or welcoming to have to sit in filth while you eat its not acceptable to have to clean your own table this hasnt been a one time issue  its literally every time ive been there if theyre busy or whatever they still have to employ enough people to have someone on cleaning duty it doesnt matter how good the food is once you see the dining room with crumbs and food and garbage from the table down to the floor you lose your appetite and start to question the quality of your food if they leave the dining room in that condition how does the kitchen look  not okay needs to be fixed wont be back until then and wont recommend until then   qdobas dining room is always spotless and inviting clean up chipotlethis location is right by my work and so my coworker and i visit frequently  the past several times they have messed up the order when my coworker orders for us  either they mess up our breakfast sandwiches or they mess up our coffees  it has come to the point now where we are not surprised if they dont get it right  my coworker has pretty much given up on visiting this location  she has given them countless tries to redeem their selves and they have failed to do so i went there this morning and ordered 3 coffees and they messed up 2 of the 3  i called and they told me i can come back in and they will make them for me the way i ordered but i am already at work so i will have to go back another day to get them  this is a major inconveniencei gotta disagree with the others  the donuts here are fine but nothing nothing here is made from scratch  take a look at the tubs of filling and mixes in the back  on the upside you can get a handy clean used bucket for 1the food is always good here but the employees are very very slow theres always a massive line  of because of an influx of people but because of sluggish servicewe werent all that impressed with the shop it was more than my coffee at starbucks which i would have preferred the atmosphere was trendy and industrial lookingwhat a crap hole im shocked that a publicly traded high profile grocery store would just let themselves go like this   you walk in and theirs the stench of death  thats the rotting meat from the strange looking butcher who talks to himself omg and the deli yikes  no service when there is someone there they look like an escapee from the funny farm who forgot their meds that day dont use the restroom youd be safer crapping out back behind the store it wreaks of mood and funky stench   bright points however some of the cashiers are very helpful and friendly but you get the overall feeling that nobody is happy with management  i can see why the produce department is pretty good i have to say and the guys how run it do a decent job of keeping it stocked and clean frozen foods could use some help  i couldnt even get a simple bag of carrots  peas  overall the store needs a good deep cleaning and is really too small to service their community  they dont even have their own pharmacy  you have to drive across the street and risk your life at the stupid intersection  i would prefer to have a 1 stop shop and for that reason i generally go to costco if im going to have to get in my car in the first placeit just seems everything in this store is meh except the doughnuts those are the best grocery store doughnuts in the valley the employees arent horrible but arent friendly either and the store is really dirty which is crazy because its not that old they built a brand new building for this locationthis place is always crowded and after eating there not sure why  prices are quite low service is ok and food is absolutely nothing to wait in line for  our party had burgers  there are much better burgers to be had within a mile of this place and country fried steak  almost inedible  worse was they only have 3 beers on tap  whatthis was our second time at tbbc  the first time we went for drinks and apps and thats what we should have done this time  when we walked in there was no one at the hostess stand  we didnt wait that long but when the hostess walked up she literally just stared at us   i mean she didnt say a word  no greeting no welcome nothing  zero zip nada   very strange behavior for a hostess   she actually never said anything so we finally told her we had a party of six and she took us to a table   the table she took us too was crammed into a corner and was just a very uncomfortable fit   we asked if we could move to another table a round one up by the bar and you would have thought wed asked her for a kidney   she seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved    our group ordered appetizers which were good  nothing spectacular thoughyummy cheese and mustard sauces for the obviously frozen pretzels  the salsa was okay chips meh  hands down chilis has the best chips around   several of our party tried the beer flights which they really enjoyed     this is the first time weve ever eaten inside and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time but they brought bottles of cold water about the size of a wine bottle to your table where water glasses already sat   they kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal  a cute concept but had to keep asking for ice they brought one glass to be shared with the table  like i said cute concept but again i personally prefer ice water and dont want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal    the food  ahhh where to begin    i had a cup of their beer cheese soup which was tasty but it just seemed to be lacking something   which honestly pretty much sums up everything there   i ordered the southwest black bean burger with a side of fries fries at the recommendation of our server over the whitecheddar mashed potatoes    this was truly one of the most blah burgers i have ever eaten  if i had not asked for onion on it i dont think it would have had any taste  the guacamole crme on the burger had no taste at all   i think it was just pureed avocado with nothing else added   another thing and this is just my personal preference the buns are ciabatta and i just dont like ciabatta buns for a burger   i like a good oldfashioned sesameseed topped hamburger bun   i only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest  the fries were completely nondescript mcdonalds fries are a 1000 times better  my boyfriend ordered their redeye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare it was served welldone with so much extras glopped on he had to eat it with a fork  he however got some fancy ketchup for his fries which i did not   the fancy ketchup still couldnt disguise the fact that the fries were so blah  overall a very lacking and disappointing experience    we would definitely not go back for a meal and not even sure if we would for apps and drinks  personally i dont care for craft beer and there are many other places to go with better drink offers and better appsive passed this place and decided to give it a try  i got there at 905 on a friday night  the place looked like it was closed but the sign on the door said that dinein closes at 9 but that takeout is open until 10  i walked in and the waitress said that they were closed  i pointed out the sign on the door which she read and said oh i guess were open then  i ordered a small cheese pizza with extra cheese which came to almost 1300  they were shutting down the restaurant while i waited  when the pizza was done the box they handed me was the size of a cd well not that small but pretty small  see the picture ive attached with the pizza next to a remote  for 1300 i expected their small would be larger than 9  the pizza itself was ok  i got the neapolitan crust which was pretty good  the sauce was very tangy and was more like a spaghetti marinara than a pizza sauce although not bad  there was a lot of cheese but it wasnt sliced very well so the whole pizza fell apart when trying to take a slice  overall the pizza just didnt seem put together very well  it kind of tasted like a pizza you might try to make at home with ingredients from winn dixie  the menu is pretty large and has a lot of items other than pizza  im not sure if i will try this place again  i will update the review if i dosame experience every time i go there foods totally fine terrible wait times and people who arent as friendly as they should be especially considering the extended wait timesdecent food saves this ratingbad value 10 for a turkey sandwich with lettuce if you order a sandwich expect to pay extra for basics like tomato and onion or better yet skip this place altogetherprices a bit high selection nothing special get thee to the trader joes on marketfood was mediocre service was mediocre fish tacos were fishy and didnt have the slaw they discussed on the menu live guac had not enough fixings to go with the avocados they used  plain tasting the carne asada was ordered rare and came back over cooked waitress seemed pretty miserable not the best experience at an on the bordernot worth the apparent hype that seemed to revolve around this place  our server was nice and professional accommodating to our complaints although we generally arent the type to complain wife ordered the avocado omelet and it was salty and had two thin slices of avocado hardly appropriate for price or for a dish whose namesake is avocado i had fried oyster benedict eggs were poached perfectly but oysters were either way overcooked or not fresh had to spit out parts of each oyster because they were rubbery and chewy not the case at any of the other places i had oysters during our trip daughter had traditional breakfast and there was an eyelash or small hair in the food during our meal also overheard neighboring table mention they must have ordered the wrong thing would not recommendedi must have went the wrong time of day  i got in town at around 4pm so i stopped at morning call i used to come here back in the day for a late night snack and to study  i get an order to kill some time before dinner because im starving but i dont want to completely ruin dinner so i have a snack  a milk and an order of beignets  the beignets were completely cold   i know their potential but unfortunately it wasnt up to par at the time    i know when theyre hot and fresh theyre awesomei had a pretty disappointing lunch buffet here this past weekend their food was edible and okay at best the various dishes were bland and a chore to eat i had 2 plates and was still hungry but nothing was notable and dare i say bearable enough for me to want to go back for a 3rd as a self proclaimed glutton thats saying something ive definitely had better indian foodsad when i am forced to drop two stars from an old review   first the have force out the old cook and the lady who ran the counter   the new lady who works the counter burns incense  next the food quality and portions dropped but the prices went up   all of this was executable   about a month ago i ordered a sandwich the grand total of which costed over 16   i paid 2 for bacon it came with 4 2 inch slices   really the only reason i bother to eat there was because i could get dinner food at 630 am   well as of today i guess you can no longer order a cheese steal till closer to lunch   left will go on but i be going to other locations that are willing to cater to the late night employ getting off workthe south street night market was just another nail sealing me in my im officially too old for this sort of thing coffin  i made the mistake of not getting there until after 800 by which time the crowds barely allowed one to move down the street  i stood in a 45minute line to get a grilled cheese sandwich  it was expensive not very large and not very good  i was still hungry but so done with the event  one of the perks of being old is the ability to bail with my old person money to a nice restaurant where i sat at a table and had other people bring food to me  i will be leaving future night markets to the kids who did seem to be having a lot of funfish was very old tasting   the restaurant felt like a tourist only restaurant   wait staff was average   the outdoor seating was nicesorry but that this tour is by a company named best tours is an oxymoron  the only reason i gave two stars is that we were introduced to two wonderful bakeries and we had a living social deal so i dont feel as ripped off as i would have had i paid full price  otherwise this was a total bust  in one hour some people felt it was supposed to be 2 hours we covered 2 miles and while the first two places were very nice the third and fourth were not  the last place scoop deville is a wellknown ice cream restaurant and our cupcakes were clearly frozen and very dried out  the tour guide practically ran the very large group from place to place and provided little to no information about philadelphia which i kind of thought was supposed to be part of the experience  if you go dont expect to leave full  we had 12 cookie one mini cupcake and 13 of a cupcake at the other two places   andfurther disappointment was not a macaron in sightwe bought our kids here for lunch the table we sat on had ants on it so we were reseated they were out of kids menus out of the soda we asked for and were also out of mild salsa  because they were out of tomatoes even though they are located in the same shopping center as the grocery store weve eaten here before but i think itll be awhile before we come back this is sad because i truly do want to support the local businessas others have said the pizza had parts that were burnt char on the bottom maybe this restaurant needs to clean its oven or pan that the pizza sits on those burnt areas really ruin the flavor overall the pizza sauce cheese and crust was okay not good and not bad   the interior decorating and atmosphere of this restaurant could use some work its certainly not a place that id ever choose to sit and eat very blandim here a few times a week i would like to give it a higher star rating but due to the service issues i am giving it a two   the drinks here are always on point   the lines are long and they rarely are running both registers   on a regular basis there is something missing at the customer prep bar missing cream sugar stir sticks stopperssuper disappointed with this place today i tried the yogurt the other day and it tasted good though expensive my fiance loves ice cream cake so for his birthday i ordered an ice cream cake to be delivered literally next door like 8 feet away and it didnt happen  i spoke with the owner earlier in the week and he was super friendly and eager to have a cake made and was the one to suggest that it could be delivered since i mentioned he worked right next door i asked if i could pay over the phone so i didnt have to make a separate trip to the store but was told they would incur fees if they did that and that i should come in person even if it was after the time of delivery it was a bit annoying to have to make a separate trip but i was happy that they seemed to be flexible if i couldnt make it there before today  i happened to be able to get to the store on wednesday to place the order and i was there for a quite a while there was only one person there and while she was very friendly she seemed pretty flustered having to deal with placing my order and handling other customers as they came in she didnt really know much about the cake options and had me speak to their manager on her cell phone to answer my questions really not a big deal but i had assumed that employees would know the basics about how many servings were in a cake what flavors we could do etc while expensive 35 i went for the regular size once we finally established the order the cash registers all temporarily crashed and were denying peoples cards we finally got it ordered and paid for and again a delivery time of 1215 was confirmed his name was taken and my phone number was taken in case there were any issues i specified what time it had to be delivered because it is when my fiance is on his break and would have to go back into a classroom to teach and the cake would just turn into a melty mess if it had to sit there   when i hadnt heard from him i called the store to see if it had been delivered i called three times in about 20 minutes and no one answered the phone so i called my fiance and while not wanting to ruin the surprise had to ask if it had arrived it hadnt one of his coworkers went next door to check on it and it was still sitting there the person working eventually ended up calling me and saying that she couldnt leave the store since she was the only one there but that someone came and picked it up after i called him and told him to check on it on top of it im told that it didnt even taste very good    as an edit to my original review as soon as the owner found out that there was a problem he called to try and right the situation in any way possible he didnt try to make excuses for why it happened but apologized that we had a negative experience with the store through the whole process he has been very friendly and professional and i appreciate him reaching out to see what they could do to fix it  i understand these things do happen occasionally and it says a lot when a business owner actively takes steps to make the situation better  like i said originally the yogurt is good and i appreciate the efforts so i will be giving them another chancethis was our second time here and i left thinking again the food is just very ordinary  i had a cesar salad which had no taste and then follow that with a predue chicken rosemary so very bland the hostess and wait staff were just fine but the food was just ok not really worth coming back forunfortunately i was rather let down food was mediocre at best service was deplorable and it had a bit of a dive feel to the atmosphere very disappointedi so agree with the other reviews  the previous owner had a awesome buffet and i would eat there a couple of times a week  the new buffet is awful  so sadokay  so its always been a fantasy of mine to experience italian food through a drive thru  now i know why you probably shouldnt  hard sticky fettucini with watery alfredo from a can with a chewy stick that resembles a garlic bread stick  my cafeteria in school made better pizza    i was hungry so i ate it  italian food is better in a restaurantwanted  to try it but im a true  believer that you get what you pay for not alot of toppings which doesnt make the pizza filling too much sweet sauce in my opinion  the dough  was extremely  hard  tough at the edge not a comparison  at all to five points pizzayou ask the community to support you and we do i come here all i spend more time waiting in line than i do actually shopping its very frustrating to see all the closed lanes hire some more people from the community and fix this problem youre not only more expensive than walmart but youre becoming more inconvenient as wellits not my favorite place  all the family got the runs after dinner food was late and came out cold great service and mgmtabsolutely delicious diner food we all have our favorites the best time for me is breakfast but lunch is also ok its an average nj diner the servers always take care of us theres a lot of regulars here and you really get that small town feel when dining here a diner like this should be the highlight of many small towns across the us im glad to have this place in my backyard well continue to bring the family inmy bestie and i decided to eat here after a long night of bar hopping lol we were looking at restaurants that stayed open 247 and luckily they did so we arrived around 300am in the morning and it wasnt that crowded at all the service was kind of slow for a small group of people i ordered the chicken and waffles and my bestie ordered the appetizer sampler overall my food was good it was a little on the cold side however the waffles was crisp buttery and flavorful and i always love their variety of syrups the service was just ok and the restaurant had a little bit of an odor and because of that they get two starsoverpriced diner food  the food was just ok and the service was pretty bad for us but the locals seemed to get better service  will not returnthis restaurant is not like what it used to when i visited two years ago  i am not sure what the hype is all aboutmaybe its for the different han dynasty but the food is not goodthis could explain why they couldnt get another zagat rating  we ordered the beef noodle soup and it was blend  the favour of the soup didnt have enough time to penetrate the noodle so it tasted like noodleandsoup not noodle soup  if you go down the block to visit zwei and have their chilli beef noodle soup youll know what i am talking about  we also had the scallion pancake but it was bit overfried so we could taste the bitterness  the string bean dish is the only dish that is still up to par  as for atmosphere the restaurant needs a serious rework  the restaurant is dark and gloomy but the decor wasnt going to the trendy theme  the benches all have holes on them  the feel of the restaurant is that its cheap and rundownwhen i went to get a burger i was starving looked at reviews and figured i could not go wrong too bad that was not the case i got in and waited 5 min to order because there was no one at the register once i ordered i had to wait 10 min for a burger and fries overall the truffle burger was way over done and dry way too done for a medium burger which had no pink the fries were greasy and did not have any flavor i have had some great food in philly this was not one of themreasonable eurostyle doner at shocking tourist prices   the plate  meat bread sauce two sides  was a ruinous 15 the bread was soft and undertoasted but the meat whole a bit too finely ground was wellseasoned properly fatty and freshly carved from the elephants leg salad had a variety of options including nicely soured cabbage and some firm but tasty lentils skip the fries   with a can of diet coke this was edging 18 bucks which is unforgivable so while the food was perfectly enjoyable i rate by value and as such have to give it just two stars   very friendly service if a little overbearingit took them over an hour and fifteen minutes on a carry out i ordered and they served people that walked in off the streets before they finally got mine made if you have the time order the pizza its solidfood was fine just like in every taco bell it is but man service the girl at the register was standing right in front of us and talking to someone in the kitchen so we had to wait for them to finish their conversation so she could take our order we ordered a ps4 box special and didnt receive it they just put our food in a paper bag we had to come back in and ask for the box which was the whole point of getting that pretty expensive special the girl gave us a why do you need it look and gave us the box isnt the store manager supposed to communicate to their employees about all the specials theyre running  next and last time we came there to eat inside every single table was dirty i had to clean one myself food was fine again service was below taco bell averageonce again not sure what all of the fuss is about i visited here with one of my close friends about a week ago and there was nothing amazing about it the service was pretty horrible we were ignored for about 1520 minutes after we were seated we had to move outside because it was so loud in the restaurant i couldnt think the burgers were really small given the prices and i wasnt impressed at all with how they tasted i will say that their mint chocolate shake was delicious regardless i will definitely not be backworst chipotle experience hands down food is cold order placed and paid for online was incorrect completely forgot chips with that order and exceptionally chintzy on the chips on the order that did get chips seriously quality customer service shouldnt be an issue regardless of ordering online or in person chipotle offered no options for correcting these issues when a call was placed regarding mistakesend of pier free 90min parking on pier 250 every hour after not a fan of the food everything blan seafood wasnt great think ppl come here to sit and eat on the pier  sorry its a gimmick tourist place service and view is great but i expected better quality seafood maybe i came on an off day not one item we got was even decent but its a great view  inside seat is stuff and dirty so dont come in your sunday best but its total cute pier shop outdoor seating can get cold if you go during the fallused to be a favorite weekend stop but havent been in a while service was lacking we paid for our food and went to get a cup of coffee surprised to see that 3 of 4 pots were completely empty once we let them know they reacted quickly but glasses for water were gone too wish they would have noticed specialty coffee came after breakfast in a paper cup just not what we expected from rembrandtswe came here on a sunday to grab some lunch after a morning at the dog park there was only one other family there the staff was a little disconnected and didnt seem interested in helping us the only drinks she offered me were in a case with water naked juice and gatorade not much of a selection our food was pretty good but the service and dynamic of the people working there was weird and unwelcoming the food was good enough but i felt uncomfortable being therei understand its family friendly but its totally inappropriate they allow children to sit at the barim talking single digits its bad enough theyre allowed to occupy the bar booths but that is completely ridiculous their steaks  green beans are on point but that is just crazyill start positive the place is nice and fairly toned they have a nice ambiance and the staff working was polite as could be now the beer selection is quite good and a few of them arent bad the pig porter is my fave now the bad the food i went twice in the hopes that i had just caught them on a bad day i hadnt the french onion soup was bland ive never wanted to salt it anywhere but here yikes the chili rubbed steak was cooked to order and thats about it i think they forgot the chili i had filet medallions as well and again no flavor everything i ate here was so bland that it not only disappointed me but hurt my wallet as well this place is horribly overpriced for the low quality food the last thing i disliked was on my first visit there were a few kids 2022 off the clock at the bar i havent heard that many eff bombs in an establishment in quite a while theyre conversation about how 25 is old and cruddy wasnt too exciting to listen to either two visits two fails one customer that will never returnalright so i will say rembrandts has a very comftorable atmosphere and has nice art hanging but as someone who truly loves coffee its not very good the baristas are not trained properly but there are occasions that someone that worked at another shop where they were trained works there and can pull a good shot i asked for ristretto shots and they had no idea what i was talking about its been about three months since ive been there but for the most part the coffee was burnt and their iced coffee was more like dirty water dont go out of your way to triple brew it or anything their boba bubble tea is okay until you get to the boba itself which is generally hard in the middle this place has a really cool vibe but i think it gets 5 stars because its a bit ritsy compared to most coffee shops and folks in eagle are definitely fans of the fancy all in all if youre in eagle and want a place to sit browse the websocialize its a great place but if youre jonesin for a good cup of the dark stuff i would say go elsewherei have been a regular customer for a long time yet they always sell me yesterdays bakery even if i ask for todays not goodwith mole on my mind we decided to try las cazuelas believe it or not its tough to find a mexican byob with mole dishes on their menu in this city from the get go i knew service was going to be an issue the hostess couldnt accommodate us sitting upstairs because she claimed she had to fill the first floor first so she squished us into the only remaining table downstairs for the entire meal i felt like everyone in the restaurant could hear my conversation and i could clearly hear theirs making it a very uncomfortable dining experience  after being seated we waited over 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink orders which was completely unacceptable as there were 2 servers and only 20 people in the tiny restaurant  anyways you now understand that the service was terrible on to the food we started with the chicken quesadillas and las tres marias which were corn patties topped with pork chicken black beans and chipotle the apps were yummy but i would pass on the quesadillas as they were nothing special for dinner we had the chicken mole which was only slightly above average  the portion was average and it was 1750 for the entree which was a bit high considering i finished my meal and was still slightly hungry  i would return only to try other items and if i happened to be in the neighborhood there are other mexican restaurants in the city that are much better and as affordablecould be very good had lunch there today for first time breast was a tiny overcooked piece of crust with part of the back intact horrible cut of chicken they should be embarrassed to serve his spice and flavor was good just needed more than three bites of meat  had the slaw clearly smelled spoiled had to spit it out  wings were tiny threebiters but at least werent burnt to a crisp like breast  if you want true quality hot chicken go to big shakes in franklinsnotty hostess unless you like stink eye runniest hollondais ever good otherwise  dont bother  otherwisethe smoothies here were so bland they did not taste fresh at all and it was 9 i did like the actual environment and setting for the businesswe were directed here by someone at another brewery that for me is a good sell i was told that it may be too crowded and to go to some other place if it was but there was a spot right there on the patio i was mainly looking for beer but we were hungry parking was a bit atrocious but its more the neighborhood than anything it was also very difficult to get in to the area we ended up only about a block away though in a free spot the patio is nice enough but features cheap lawn furniture im not looking for white table cloths but when my chair is from walmart and cost less than half what im paying for my meal its annoying but im glad we were outside because of what the inside looked like dank is the word id use everything was dark musty and kind of strange if they were going for the british pub look they didnt succeed the size of the bar really disappointed me its supposed to be a brewpub so why have a bar thats only 5 or so long and that should have signaled to me right there that this is the sort of brewpub that focuses on food not beer because that seems to be the case the beer wasnt awful but everything was very safe and a lot of it just wasnt very good i was impressed that they did nitrocask pours but they were served cold i was told later by a local bartender who also spoke highly of this place that their beer is supposed to be more english style that actually redeems the beer in my mind a little because it makes sense why some of them tasted as they did but theyre still not good the food also was not good i mean it wasnt bad where id throw it down and say this is awful and refuse to eat it but it was just so mediocre i got the sausage sandwich which was served with sauerkraut from the can on a slightly stale roll and the sausage was undercooked i got the mashed potatoes for a side which were good but were topped with a watery gravy that looked had the consistency of and tasted more like sweet coffee than anything my companion got the vegetarian sloppy joe which was more like vegetarian chili than anything she got a side of the vegetables which were undercooked the service was relatively slow throughout the meal but the girl was nice until i asked about a charge at the end of the meal both of our standard sides had been fries but we both decided to change i noticed the list of sides along with their prices are at the bottom of the menu that my mashed potatoes with gravy were 025 more than the standard fries while my companions veggies were the same price on the ticket instead of being upcharged 025 i was charged the full 175 the server said that this was how it was and it was more a fluke that my companion wasnt charged than me being charged my whole thing if youre going to charge the full price for a side substitution then give me the other side its just fair but we protested and she huffed off not to return for about 10 minutes after that i was also irked by the sampler price 125 each which added up to 10 10 for eight samples that seems high and it would have been nice to know that beforehand we could have gotten away with that place kind of sucked and left it there but the issue with the ticket and the fact that i had been deliberately led here by others left me feeling so slighted that i started saying i should say something to the manager im not the type to usually talk to the manager in fact ive done it all of twice in my recent memory once here and once at the worst boston market id ever encountered in suburban atlanta where i told the guy that his franchise should be taken away and that he should be ashamed of his operation here i just mentioned that it was a bad experience all around and that he should consider worked on the sampler pricing because 10 is absurd for the quality of that beer i had already paid and wanted nothing but to give them feedback that i hoped would help them will it probably not because this place is so busy that they dont really need me and they dont need my feedback im sure i was written off as just a selfrighteous asshole i would offer this to readers though there are four brewpubs in the broad ripple area so if youre looking to patronize one for dinner your options are not limited and are much better elsewhere 1 but 2 when i realized that the beer was supposed to be english style it would have helped to have known that just as it would have helped to have known beforehand the sampler pricing a sign outside saying this is going to suck also would have been helpful but not necessarytwo stars because they took twenty minutes to get 2 burgers out and then another 8 for nachos then another 12 for two tacos there where only 2 adults and a kid in our party 4 other people came in during our visit and where also waiting ridicules amounts of time for food and no  drive though orders came in that time food was decent when it did come no explanation was offered to us for the timerandomly closes outside of advertised hours  never understand this either update your hours or stay open this isnt a difficult conceptfood okay but service subpar with an attitude not coming back and i live a block away with minimal options downtown disappointedstopped today  got a butterscotch concrete to go got home  all i tasted was vanillaat the bottom was a drop of beige liquid even that didnt have a butterscotch flavor really disappointed i wanted to at least taste some butterscotchi absolutely love tjs however i was very saddened to see when i went in for my weekly purchase of macarons they had increased the price from 299 to 499 overnightas in i had bought some the day before and then went in the next day to purchase some for someone else and they had increased in price by almost 67 what gives tjthis location is an entirely differently run operation than the 18th st location i was the only customer at 1130 and two people at registers did not make eye contact until i asked if they were going to take my order whereas at 18th they are driven to be efficient and friendly proactively taking orders with an ipad in the waiting line when my drink was ready and the my salad the two individuals who were supposed to bag it and let me know were preoccupied with stocking below the counter and i had to draw their attention to my salad ready for their attention the manager was wearing a dirty apron this location seems to have a lot of catering orders that seemed to preoccupy the staff to the extent that they could not pay attention to the customers who showed up one at a timefood was fresh and tasty but didnt get a lot for the buck 11 and didnt come out feeling full long wait to order though not that busy couple other employess finally came to help in the kitchen cold rainy night yet the ac was cranking not fun eating with cold hands and winter coat onbland and lacking when you order cauliflower rice as a base its expected to get more than a tablespoon or so of it tofu was tasteless and not cooked long enough seemed to be cooked on only one side even with the dressing which was good on its own it tasted pretty boring i dont expect much from vegan options in ta and it seems it will be that way for a while the staff was very friendly at leastmy boyfriend and i are from la and we were staying in montecito for a couple of days for a nice little get away we were recommended by a friend to have tre lune for dinner so we went my boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs while i ordered pasta with smoked salmon i enjoyed my pasta while my boyfriend said his was okay as he took his last bite he said he felt like he was experiencing an allergic reaction he has a peanut allergy we asked our server what his pasta was cooked in and he quickly brought the manager to us the manager said that the pasta was cooked in canola oil which im guessing my boyfriend is allergic to as well and he had no idea my boyfriend felt dizzy and went to the bathroom the manager and other employees were very nice and helpful about the situation but they brought out the check and his spaghetti was still on the bill i dont know how i feel about that i understand that its not their fault for not knowing he has this allergy but come on where is your heart he was so sick i walked him back to our place literally holding him up the whole way as we got home he was vommiting and could not breathe i ended up taking him to the hospital where they shot an epi pen in him and hooked him up to the iv we were at the hospital for 4 hours if you have any food allergies i guess be careful i also find it strange that they cook their pasta in canola oil canola oil is a very cheap oil to use but i still managed to spend 60 for two plates of pastai am not familiar with onion in mac salad  teriyaki needs to be truly grilled  not the worst ive had butive tried livery on multiple occasions thinking each time it will prove to be a different experience but unfortunately they are all the same for one ive never really known what my food looks like considering the lights are so low it takes about 30 minutes to decipher the menu and thats using google far too much besides the poor presentation the actual taste is far from unique or even tasteful i hate to hate on a local mass ave restaurant but with property being scarce its a shame some one with more vision and creativity didnt step in on this loti really dont understand what all the hype is about before you go understand these are cake donuts not yeast donuts like youll find at dunkin donuts is  krispy kreme to be fair ive never been a fan of cake donuts but youd think with this much hype and creativity itd be a life changing experience   i got the campfire donut which is supposed to be like a smores donut a butterfinger donut a cookies and cream donut and the gooey butter donut i was most excited for the gooey butter but each of them were really dry and the gooey butter was just a regular cake donut with some gooey butter crumbs on top it just made me want to go buy gooey butter cake and not finish the donut  but like everyone else says theyre smaller than your average donut but more expensive probably not heading back anytime soon another restaurant propped up by the hype machinemediocre all the way  we were looking for a good bfast and was sorely disappointed the food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible we waited for 40 minutes for our food all eggs and pancakes when it came out it was not very warm and was blas the server did not check up on us and only mentioned in passing that they were busy and that was the reason for the delay which is interesting as a group who came in after us got their food ate and left before we got our foodive been to this establishment 3 times the 1st time was within their 1st month in businessi asked the fellow behind the counter for a cup of whatever their best coffee is i love coffee and have grown accustomed to starbucks reserve coffeesanyway the guy told me hed make me an americano and i thought at that moment this is either prepared poorly or their stuff isnt goodone of the owners were there but she didnt even say hello and was talking on the phone to what sounded like her friend for our entire visit  2nd time met a buddy for coffee there also had to give them another chance spent 4xx for my coffeetasted a bit like moms tasters choice from when i was a kidbrought back a good memory but wasnt happy with my coffee nor was my friendbutbefore we left that same owner said hello and even gave my son a chocolate chip cookiethe gesture was so nice i had to come back 3rd time with another friend  3rdand last time i stopped in my friend wanted coffee while our kids were at hebrew school up the streethes a dunkin coffee drinkerim a starbucks coffee drinkerso i said lets stop at the coffee house it was about 6pm as we walked in the other owner husband was there and my friend asked him what he suggested as he had never been inthe owner said oh its been quiet today so i am closetingif you really want something i guess i can make you something mind you it says 7 or 730was closingwe lefttold him not to do us any favorsnot very happymy friend refuses to ever go due to the experiencesuch a shame too i love supporting local businesses but not when i have to be sorry to friends for the recommendationused to love st louis breadco but the quality and quantity has decreased significantly  the flatbreads are small and not very good  the only thing that has not changed is the price very expensive for what you geta baked omelet sandwich here translates over to processed rectangular block of eggnot two leaves of spinach and one slice of ham served on a ciabattalike squaredoughnutshaped bagelwannabe  when paired with a large coffee the total ends up being under four dollars  well you get what you pay for and given this is cosi which again has yet to impress me thats not a whole friggin lot  like dcs union station phillys 30th street stations food options dont leave a whole lot of wiggle room for decent diningthis locations leaves something to be desired  long wait times  no strawberry cones leaving my two year old daughter pretty sad its just okay  id rather go to twistee treatmy roommates  i decided to try this place out the pho is okay but its pretty pricey we also got pork fried rice beef chow fun and the tofu pad thai at about 945 per plate all of the dishes were mediocre at best i would definitely try somewhere else however their smoothiesdrinks are very yummy but again pretty pricey starting at 5who delivers a calzone with no utensils was moving out and ordered some lunch from them to be delivered food was alright but hard to eat without a fork all of mine were packed had to throw a lot of it out because it was falling apart wasnt too devastated about not being able to finish itthe food is good here but the service and cleanliness are not i have come in here a few times because my work is close and every time the employees are very short with you borderline rude and interrupt you while you try to order the counters are filthy the dispensers are disheveled and the floor today was so sticky it was ridiculous its one thing if its really busy and no one is able to keep up with organization and cleanliness but it was dead today and no one was making any effort to clean up im disappointed with this establishmenti tried this place again for the second time and it was consistently disappointing i dont expect much from an airport pasta restaurant but this one was just not that good i ordered the baked mostaciolli and the pasta itself was okay but the sauce was super salty and the cheese appeared microwaved onto it there was no hint of browning it also the meatball tasted like meatloaf it had a lot of bread filler in it i also started with a salad which was mostly wilted iceberg and a few leaves of dark greens i can say the service wasnt bad but the food is meh the tables are cramped and i didnt really enjoy my meali havent been to fazolis in a couple years so when i saw there was a location just down the street from my work i decided to give it a try i have to say overall it was pretty disappointing i stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before someone realized i was there and then i waited another 3 minutes so that she could finish telling her co workers about her dating life in more detail than i personally wanted to hear then about 15 min later i got my order of baked spaghetti which looks significantly smaller than i remember it being before one tip i can give is make your bread sticks last because no one is going to come around and offer you more the floors in the dining area look like they hadnt been swept in days and the whole place is dimly lit overall i cant justify spending my money on mediocre food in a poorly runstaffed place like thisoverpriced service not great our server didnt even know the menu tables not cleaned well burger was good thoughmy boyfriend and i are staying at a friends house right next to the keswick theatre and she told us this place had good breakfast sandwiches to go so we decided to try them but changed our mind when we talked in and decided to sit and eat   we sat ourselves at the bar and started off on the wrong foot after the two waitresses didnt greet us right away they were too busy chatting it up with some of the spots usual patrons one of the servers still ignoring us went to the back to get a yogurt and ate it right there behind the counter while she continued to talk to the other customers she got halfway through her snack before the other server made a motion towards us and then she came over and said hello so the fact that we had to watch her eat with her back turned at us before we were even greeted or got coffee irritated me a lot   from that point on it the service did improve slightly the food itself wasnt good i ordered the village scrambler which was supposed to have onion and peppers in it but i maybe tasted them in 2 bites total the pieces were tiny and very sparse which is a shame because i ordered that number intentionally because it had veggies in it the home fries were not what i know home fries as they were thinly sliced potato circles that had been dropped in a deep fryer they tasted stale as if they had been dropped cooled down then redropped for my order maybe thats standard for some diners to serve home fries that way but i prefer mine fries on a griddle so they are a little crispy on the outside   service was slow leaving the diner as well we sat there with our plates and mugs empty and tried to make eye contact with the servers but once again they were deep in small talk with some customers on the other side of the bar   i am sad this place was disappointing because it looks so cute and welcoming i might try it again but ill stick to the breakfast sandwiches to gopizza its as personal as bbq but a good one can appeal to most palates i was happy with the overall quality of the food while the sausage and bacon fall somewhat short the other ingredients were flavorful and fresh topping quantity was generous and pizza size true to what you would expect i would have given this restaurant 4 stars barring 2 critical areas of importance 1 cleanliness was lacking the table tent s distributed at the order counter hadnt been cleaned in sometime floors have been spot mopped but are filthy around cornersedges bathroom doors walls floors not good newer building with 30 year old grime 2 probably responsible for 1 is this point poorly managed employees service was friendly but slow customers waiting while employees on personal cell phones counter not attended kept us from ordering a second round of beers this place needs someone to take charge     i will give them another try mainly because the convenient location i hope these things improve and i can change this to more starsthe service was wonderful there is not a great selection of vegetarian options in fact there are none my friend had the pho and there was barely any noodles in it my husband and i had the vermicelli i had the chicken and it tasted wonderful but there were only a few pieces of chicken my husband had the beef and it tasted wonderful but they were only a few pieces of beef we left hungry we prefer the saigon noodle house in goleta much more flavorful food and many more optionsi want to love this store  they are and right next door to my house and they are open 24 hours they have a nice selection of fruits and veggies and alcohol reasons for 2 stars   however the staff isnt that friendly i had purchased three clusters of snow crab drove the min and a half home to my house and put them into the pot to cook for lunch when i pulled them out of the pot they stank of ammonia  bleachy smell i looked it up everything i found said they were bad i called the store and after be transferred from staff member to staff member one finally told me to just come back for a refund i asked if i needed to bring them back   that i totally wouldit had only been a matter of 25 mins between buying and finding them rotten  and she told me no just come back with your receipt  so i went in only to be talked down too like i was a lying and b like i was dumb for not bringing them back  i told the woman working customer service not the one i spoke to on the phone thats id be happy to go get them and come back i just wanted my 30 back finally got a refund after 15 mins and some eye rolls and huffing and puffing from the lady working  i told them twice they need to pull the snow crab off the shelf because they may make someone ill  came back the next day to find the same snow crab there   this afternoon i was eating some of their tomato basil soup you can get when you walk right into the store on the starbucks side  halfway through i found plastic in the soup picture attached  im not even going to bother calling because frankly they probably wont do anything about it since they left the rotten snow crab on the shelf and i really dont think the 499 back is worth the attitude and 15 min ordeal   i recommend only buying fruits and veggiesnice atmosphere great food poor service  let me start by saying the food is delicious husband had pasta with vodka sauce mom had seafood chefs best and i had manicotti kids pizza was surprisingly good too  what brings the stars down was the awful service when you are about to walk out at every stage of a restaurant experience something is wrong it took 15 minutes to get water 45 to get our meals 30 after that to get the check and boxes  which we had to flag down the host for in the two hours we were there our waters were refilled twicenice staff but hope youre not in a rush as they tend to take a very long time drinks are much quicker than food and they do have a nice selection there also seems to be an item wrong every time we have gone therethis is the slowest steak n shake i have ever been to one night the drive thru took 25 minutesfirst time at this location we ordered takeout and when i arrived 12 people were standing outside the window one girl was serving everyone and packaging their orders and taking money three guys could be seen in the kitchen talking but not helping overall it was mass chaos creating an experience i do not want to repeatthis place is really 5050 its either good or its bad ive had times where my waitress never came to check up on my table times where my waitress made me lose my appetite and other times where there are no complaints really taking a chance with this location but luckily there are other good restaurants around the alaskan crab is way overpriced for its sizetaste and preparation oh and its cold you eat against a wall and the coleslaw is not fresh  overall cheap restaurant very touristy and overpriced not recommendednot sure how  this gets high marks food was bland and just covered up by lots of spice i dont mind spicy food at all but this just had no taste was very disappointedwe really wanted this place to be great but we left disappointed they have kinks to work out as a new business  we will try again in a year or so had their cuban which was pretty darn good server was friendly and attentive ambiance has some work to do i like the lab chairs drink glasses posters in relation to science on the wall however they were blasting top 20 hits to the point where i could barely hear my fiance talk we are 30 and 27 so no hearing aids requiredand we were 1 of 2 couples there on a monday night it just felt really awkward and uncomfortable it has potential and as a science fan engaged to a science teacher we hope they turn it around if we were to give any advice and feel free to take this however you like  go to flat12 and listen to their music and replicate it i think it would work well with the vibe of the room also take an old tube tv and run some science programs on loop in the background ie bill nye the science guy cosmos planet earth  magic school bus etc people will feel the nostalgia and it could add to the science theme of the establishment  all in all it felt thrown together without a business strategy  here is hoping they turn it around because it could be greatas much as i love indian food this place was kind of a disappointment  i came here during lunch with my intern friend and we both wanted to try this indian chipotle concept i ordered the rice bowl  chicken along with some toppings   the chicken was dry and bland and the toppings were not fresh the owner recommended that i get the crispy chickpea topping but it was not crispy at all except 2 bites so my guess is that those crispy toppings were not fresh the spinach sauce topping was good though as the owner recommended ive had better indian food and this really does not cut it though if youre looking for a quick lunch with protein and veggies this is worth a tryhad such high hopes and was great when it first opened and has gradually gone down hill the place has no feel to it the quality of food and service has declinedto say it was disappointing was an understatement    we get there and it was obviously the end of the day  wife and i both got 455 breakfast in a bagel sandwich and they were both highly regrettable  small no filling to the bagel was not that good  when wegmans has a better bagel than you do youve go problems   one egg little piece of bacon or pork roll and this is almost a five dollar sand which  donuts were ok honestly not that good    a completely underwhelming experience on many levels  counter person was fine enough but the older lady was miserable she just looked tired but stillthis place was no better than ok the drinks and apps were fine i got the chicken sandwich for my main course i did not think a bad chicken sandwich was a thing but i guess i was wrong it was inediblebought a pile of groupons because it was a deal and this location is close to work but ugh i cant wait til theyre gone ive had fortels pizza before and am not a fan but i bought the groupons based on my love of the shrimp po boy from the ballwin location  this locations is justbleh   after getting it twice the shrimp is overcooked and unseasoned the untoasted baguette flatters nothing and white onions as a garnish is grossswitch to red fortels the garlic cheese bread has no garlic flavor bread again isnt toasted and its sprinkled waaay too heavy with italian seasoning a little goes a long way dont know what i was thinking exactly when i ordered the 10 bowl of spaghetti with 6 meatballs butit was a bowl of plain spaghetti with a blob of red sauce on top the red sauce had no seasoning was pretty much just tomato pasteput the italian seasoning from the garlic bread in there and the meatballs were those nastypremadefromthefreezerwith mysteryfiller meatballs  the only redemption i give fortels is their salads  the house and club salads have been pretty damn good with deep green romaine leaves fresh veggies generous toppings and homemade ranch      ill plan on using the rest of my groupons on the great salads but would never spend real money herei went here for a wine tastingfundraiser the other day the atmosphere was interesting it was a cool little place with a patio and was full of wines that are under 20 i give them 3 stars for selection and the ideaatmosphere of the place now onto the wines i would give them 2 stars for their wine  as a forewarning i have recently developed a palate for wine and have been spoiled with fine german wines from up the street i am by no means a professional or a snob about wine i am still in college so i appreciate that all of the wines are under 20 but i feel that you can get a much better bottle of wine for 2030 elsewhere in my opinion the only reason to buy cheap wine is if you are a wineo are having a party or if you are on a serious budget   moving on the wine i tasted was crap most of it was very astringent green and harsh i paid fifteen dollars for the tasting normally their tastings are 10 expecting some decent wines but only the last wine was remotely drinkable definitely over priced in my opinion   conclusion  the wine is cheap and i was not impressed with the quality if you are having a large tasting pull your best wines out the atmosphere and concept of the place is cool go here if you are a poor college student  alcoholic  need bulk wine if you want a much better bottle of wine for 20 go up the street to the wine depot on grant  alvernon they have wine tastings for 5 on fridayim totally disappointed from tony lukes here my cheesesteak had no seasoning at all its like they just took the meat and threw it on the thick bread wasnt any flavor at all i tried to add my own salt and pepper and it still didnt do anything the only reason im giving them two stars because the french fries are awesome other than that this place stinks   d in my booktried this place with a guy from work while on a business trip in philly i love pizza but ive decided im not really into the trendyupscale pizza places like this to be fair when i found this place online i didnt know that it was this style of pizza place or else i would not have checked it out we have places like this where i live in california and its just not my thing i will give it to them that their restaurant is a cool spot i really liked the outdoor patio it was also cool how one of the regulars that we were sitting next to gave us the clue to use a code word with the waiter and when i did i was told that they had 3 pies that were 12 price with mentioning that word my friend and i both picked one of those pizzas i ordered the broccoli pizza and didnt care for it at all because they broccoli had a strange chemicallike taste once i took the broccoli off it was decent but still not amazing my friend ordered a different type which i tried and i will say his was better but still not my favorite overall some people may be into this place so still give it a shotdunno what all the fuss is about  i had high hopes based on the great reviews here  so tonight we went to check it out  as soon as we pulled up and saw the sign in the window my friend said oh  chef scott  do you know him i asked  only from the farmers market  once we were inside he told me that chef scott sold him that lasagna that he took home and cooked later that was only soso  i wish he had spoken up earlier  we ate ours in the restaurant  there is virtually no ambience no art on the wall even  if the food had been really good i would have overlooked that  but it wasnt  the food is completely underwhelming  blah and meh come to mind  i can cook better lasagna and manicotti than chef scott and i am no chef  just an experienced home cook the two stars are for the clean restaurant and the friendly counter girl    dont waste your time or money  pass up this onehoped this would be as good as the one in bloomington not nice try i suppose people go for the beeri am not sure what the gourmet in the pizza is other than the somewhat unusual combos thrown together a bit like leftover moussaka the thai pizza is incredibly sweet and tangy and thankfully offset by the chewy bread the shrimp pizza is unusual without being special the chevre is a total waste of money the problem with the joint is that the pizza ingredients are thirdrate theres no point saying this is organic that is local or this was grown by 5year olds learning naturelove im exaggerating but you get the spiel if none of the stuff is flavorful or adds to the overall taste of the pizza the pizzas i ordered had terrible sundried tomatoes the tang shook my molars like a bolt from the blue the garlic in the pizza is in the form of large hemispheres  who in their right minds wants to chew hemispheres of baked garlic and finally the sauce  omg the sauce  as someone else said is so bland except the thai pizza where the sauce is like an eye poke that youre weeping for the joy of gluten and tasteless carbohydrates  if i eat gourmet pizza i expect the thing to be at the very least memorably tasty since i am stuffing into my body things that are not good for me sigh very disappointed   bmp  is someone reading this please do something to your menu   1 star for affordable prices another for reasonably good service nothing for foodnothing extraordinary i ordered pancakes with blueberries and pecans along with poached eggs and bacon the three pancakes we very fluffy and light and had no blueberries or nuts inside what i got was two little cups of super sweet blueberry compote and nuts the cracker barrels pancakes are better disappointingthe ambience is cool but the wait staff wasnt knowledgeable about the menu and the food was below expectations and over priced seriously mcdonalds would have been a better choice for breakfastthey can take the reservationthey just cant keep the reservation  we had reservations dec 29 for 7pm and were seated at 735pm  when i followed up with the hostess at 720 she said well we cant go around encouraging people to leave  i didnt appreciate the flippant response  but she was young so im guessing she hasnt had much experience andor training on customer relations  and i certainly dont expect a restaurant to do something like that but what i do expect is a restaurant to know how many reservations they can take at one time and to save tablesjust some basic restaurant management  to make matters worse my entre ribs were blackburnt and tough  i had them once before and they were very good  perhaps they had an off night with less seasoned employees running the showi tried the rock crab  sorry to say i was very disappointed  i couldnt taste the natural flavor of the sea very bland and very dry  i had better boiled crabs from safeway  i did enjoy the new england clam chowder  yummy  servers were greatwas heading to the bar  grill on the opposite corner but saw this place and thought it was interesting on the outside and would try it  seating is one big long table on the main floor so if its busy hopefully you like your neighbor   liked the atmosphere  milking cans as lights and old windows separating the kitchen area from the rest of the restaurant looked like there was additional table seating on the second floor i had the fig salad and it was good although a bit too much salad dressing once i got to the bottom of the bowl  my fault for not remembering to ask for dressing on side burgers were small round wise but fatthick so although we asked for medium the middle was very pink wasnt quite raw but pretty close   the pretzel bites wbeer cheese would have been better with some salt on them fries were very good ketchup is not your normal ketchup it has something else in it service was fine but would have been better if she smiled a bit  would i try it again if i was in the area probably  its different than what we are used tocontrary to what some reviewers have written i found our tour guide preston to be an awful representative for this business he was difficult to understand because of his speech patterns and chronic mumbling and he didnt seem to care that most of us could neither understand or even hear him we were a group of 15  preston rambles on a lot  including his personal stories  but came up short on the historic information we came to learn   our tour ended 30 minutes early  at 5 not 530  and apparently we were supposed to go somewhere for bread pudding according to other reviewers but preston eliminated that when asked why were were done early he simply said go enjoy your friday night no mention of cutting out one of our taste samples   i wish we had the other tour guide bob he seemed much more concerned with giving a great tourthis review is for the cheesecake alone   okay so maybe i got a bad batch or something but it was not as amazing as everyone raves it to be i actually thought it had a pretty strange bitter taste afterwards  i love cheesecake so i was pretty excited to bring it to this potluck that i was invited to that evening  i told everyone to try a piece bc it was said to be the best cheesecake ever instead of being proud of the cheesecake i was slightly embarrassed when most people said the taste was off and thought it was just opposite of best  ill give it another try  most likely when someone else purchases the cake bc i wouldnt want another one to go to waste on my buyhmmpassed by for the first time and decided to stop in  the space is cute and looks like a great place to hang out but the overall experience was not great   ordered the oolong milk foam tea but they didnt have any milk foam even in the early afternoon  the staff didnt mention that they would be making anymore either    instead i had to order a regular oolong milk tea and also 2 grapefruit fresh teas for my family  there were maybe two people in line in front of me but my order took 20 minutes  some of the staff seemed to be working hard while others were constantly checking their cell phone  when i finally arrived at my car i tried the oolong milk tea and it was literally just milk lactaid or milk powder with tapioca  there was no tea taste at all  the color of my drink was white  the grapefruit juices were just ok at all  it was also inconvenient that they didnt offer a bag or tray until i asked since i had 3 large drinks to carry out  overall the place is unorganized and definitely has room for improvement  with so much competition nearby i hope they can improve since the space is greatthis was one of my boyfriends favorite places to get breakfast it obviously is nothing fancy and thats the appeal they usher patrons in and out quickly and your coffee is never empty the service is quick and efficient they are friendly but dont waste time with pleasantries we always order the fouritem breakfast when we first started coming it was under 4 we could get out the door with a decent breakfast for both of us for about 10 including tip the prices have increased significantly this last visit the bill was 16 that doesnt break our bank but we also observed the service was quite a bit slower and our food was very greasy compared to previous visits we wont returni was going to give it one star but decided 2 stars is fine for the most part i get what i ordered except when i dont but ive already paid for it and have been waiting for 10 minutes only to find out they dont have the thing i wanted   i find it is not bad going through the drive through but inside you will be waiting a minimum of 5 minutes for any beverage just one beverage this isnt all staff it is 2 in particular i hate to speak ill of anyone in particular so all i will say is if you are in no rush and like to talk this is the time for you if you want coffee in a reasonable time at all dont come here especially if you are getting more than coffee  this is a full tims hortons shared with the esso the esso is fast and efficient just not the timsheard so many awesome things about this place and came with some pretty high expectations got there about 15 minutes before lunch started my bad so went outside to wait til it started i didnt understand why they couldnt take our order and wait until 11 to put it in that way we didnt walk back and forth but not every restaurant thinks of these things was very disappointed stood next to the register to give my order and when someone finally came to take it he was obviously not trained to take an order he kept fumbling with the register and had to ask someone where something was why wasnt there a proper trainer on hand crazy i ordered two pepperoni pizzas and a grilled cheese there were 3 of us we took our number and sat outside the atmosphere gets one of the stars and the grilled cheese got the other one both pizzas were completely black on the bottom ridiculous i didnt have time to get it fixed because of my silliness in coming 15 minutes early so we ate the toppings and left service was lacking food was mediocre at best and definitely would not recommendi typically only write yelp reviews when the experience is something to warned about so consider this a warning  my boyfriend his brother and i tried out in riva last night as a precursor the restaurant was not terribly busy so the issues we had were not a result of an overtaxed staff or kitchen  if our first mistake was choosing in riva to have dinner our second mistake was deciding to sit at the bar  we sat down at the bar and waited and waited and waited until the bartender finally acknowledged out presence with a halfhearted apology about making us wait  all three of us ordered both appetizers and entrees  while it was obvious that were were all dining together the kitchen decided that we should all get our food at different times  my boyfriend ordered the pea soup which came out first  about five minutes later his brothers octopus arrived and yet another five minutes later my meatballs finally arrived  my boyfriend and his brother were both finished with their appetizers before mine arrived at the bar  this ritual of staggering dishes and service was repeated when our entrees came out  again my boyfriends ravioli arrived first his brothers rigatoni followed several minutes later and my pizza arrived last and when the pastas were nearly completely consumed  this kind of service is unacceptable as it makes the dining experience awkward for all the members of the party  however no one at in riva found this to be at all problematic and it seemed to par for the course    the food in and of itself was good however it was nothing extraordinary and was way overpriced  while the prices themselves were not terrible the portions for the appetizers and the entrees were small 10 for three meatballs and 12 for three vegetable ravioli  lastly the service from the bartender was the worst service i have had in a  long time  not only were we sitting at the bar for a while before she greeted us or took even a drink order she also specialized in disappearing from the bar for long stretches of time or alternately forgot that she was working and spent her time socializing with a friend of hers rather than taking care of customers  her disappearing act occurred at all times when our food arrived which relieved her of her burden of making sure our food arrived and whether we needed anything  further after we finished we again waited and waited and waited for the check  the bartender was completely out of the restaurant chatting with the same friend that took all her attention while she was at the bar  even after she came back from her adventure with her friend we had to ask for the check at least twice before it was provided  it was clear that the last thing that the bartender wanted to do was her job    bottom line there are many pizzapasta restaurants in this city that will be getting my business from here on out and i recommend that others do the sameservice was excellent and they tried to make a good experience but i will never come back food was beyond expensive and not even close to being good ordered the clam chowder and it was beyond salty not sure if it is normally like that or bc it was nearing the end of its batch then mussels in red sauce came out beyond small and not enough flavor about half the mussels had meat that was a penny size that is not acceptable we then ordered crabs that came out drier than the sahara dessert although meaty the price of 750crab was beyond crazy the crab seemed way over cooked and then cooked again the manager did make it better by bringing out 2 new crabs that were better without us even asking for replacement which was a definite plus but they need to do something about price i went when the crabs are in season so there is no need for the price to be that high i thought fries were good but my husband think they were to soggy i thought it was the only thing that was seasoned correctly   concluding if u want good food for a reasonable price dont come here if u just want the service then this is the place go to chickies and petes for delicious crabsfunny how the location is closed citing it out grew its location i live in the area and pass by it frequently most food places have some kind of line during lunch not once did i pass by big q did they have a line often youd see the workers messing about inside killing time out of boredom the food explained it it felt like the owner was trying to create a bbq fast food franchise chain the idea was great but the food was sub par the pulled pork never had enough bbq sauce on it and the fries were even worse even if there was ample indoor seating no one would have went big q is an embarrassment to real bbq pit masters like smoken dudes in bensalem who have worked for years to create the perfect bbqi ordered the half rack ribs with corn bread and mashed potatoes ribs are very chewy and dry the corn bread and mashed potatoes are both very good fired up bbq is better will only come back here for the corn bread and mashed potatoeswhile the dessert case looked awesome i got a grilled chicken salad and didnt like it at all the chicken was ok bland but the ranch dressing tasted like mayonaise my boyfriend got a club which is hard to do poorly so it was good the server was sweet i just wish the food was betterplain interior ok service bland food not bad just not worth it in the plethora of french quarter options midday on a sunday and theyre out of grits shrimp and seafood benedict  really  boudin was dry and tasteless eggs and hash browns were good but heck even i can fix those well bavarian chocolate iced coffee was decentdespite all the hype i felt daves dogs were severely overrated the previous reviews were not offpoint when saying the hot dogs were good but they were not the best hot dogs ive ever tasted  during my visit i tried daves style and the sb style both were solid in that the ingredients looked fairly fresh and it was wellcooked however given its price it easily couldve been a costco hot dog which is bigger with additional condiments placed on top   thus taking into account the price hype and execution i felt that daves dogs are beneficiaries of a strange bandwagon effect tldr good hot dogs but overpriced and overhypeddefinitely wont be returning to this location i parked in the lot directly beside remedy and received a 50 dollar parking ticket i was literally in the cafe for 5 minutes and my 5 chai turned into 55 if the service would have been quicker i probably wouldnt have even gotten a ticket the tea was fine but i could hardly enjoy it after that experience ruining my day i wish they were more specific on their parking considering i asked an employee if i was allowed to park therehassled us about our service dog messed up both of our orders im pregnant and cant have raw egg so we told the waitress she said no problem i got an over medium egg raw in the middle so we sent it back they just scrapped off the fried egg and put scrambled on but there was still raw yolk all over the plate waitress tried to be very nice about it and blamed it on new kitchen staff but we wouldnt go backmy husband and i used a living social coupon to eat here recently on a saturday night for their 3course dinner wwine pairing and it was nothing to rave about  except that it was a great deal and the wine was good  service was friendly but lacking somewhat ie no one refilled our water no one came by to see how we were doingthey just set the items on the table and moved on the food was mediocre at best except for the first course i had soup for the starter and it was a pretty good creamy asparagus soup my husband had some sort of decent salad but it was unmemorable obviously i had a bland salmon entree and it was way overcooked and dry i did not eat it all it was served with a bland rice dish  that i skipped all together there were snap peassnow peas also as a side and they were actually done perfectly  my husband had a small steak and it too was a bit bland but cooked nicely for dessert we were served some sort of sickeningly sweet chocolate thing with berries mehi doubt we will be back coupon or no couponthere are too many good restaurants now in reno to have to put up with this type of food one word uninspiredwe stopped by for a scoop of ice cream but definitely eyed the baked treats in the dessert case there are a variety of fairly standard flavors ice cream overall i found them a little too sweet including the cinnamon bun and the black cherry that i sampledim not sure this is the same place as some of the other reviewers went to apparently  after hearing all of the buzz me and my girlfriend tried this place one early sunday morning  we ordered one of every flavor they had that day we figured we would treat it more as a sampler than a meal though all of the donuts had lots of visual appeal none were found to be anything worth raving about they were very dry and had surprisingly little flavor save for the ones with some sort of filling this at least made them somewhat salvageable  im left with the opinion that maybe some of the reviews on here were posted by people with some personal connection to the owners its a shame  the concept was first rate but the donuts were notwent here for lunch today and really was not impressed with the food or the service  pizza is way too salty and burned for my taste my husband and i used to come here when they first opened and of course the service was great service has started to decline significantly  today we waited forever for our food never got our waters refilled and had to wait 20 min to get our check while our waitress chit chatted with another waiter in the corner  come on in riva you can do bettermy family and i havent been here in about 5 yrs  we will not go back again i dont know if there is new management or what but the ceiling has a huge hole in it right near the tables where we sat it was constantly leaking and no bucket was being used you cant tell me no one noticed it   also the bathrooms were a mess the floors were sticky and one of the toilets wouldnt flush the water was leaking out of the joints and running all over the back of the toilet 2 our if the 3 sinks were broken we were really disappointed in the look and feel of this place very slow service when it was dead also  sorry but go elsewheredistrict donuts a slider donut fusion restaurant is an interesting concept but their donuts are just not up to par i ordered a couple of different donuts to try and they were all very bland bread donuts with different toppings on top other than the toppings there was nothing special about the donuts at all  especially considering the elevated price tag  skip district and go to blue dot in mid city insteadive had mixed experiences at broad ripple brew pub i like that it has a weekly special menu along with a permanent regular menu some of the best items ive had there are on the weekly special menu  but then some of their regular foods are a bit disappointing   last night my bf ordered the fish and chips off the regular menu  the fish was drenched and drowning in oil and and all we could taste was the oil i ordered the vegan dolmades plate  it was tasty but my dolmades could have had a lot more stuffing in them they were mainly grapes leaves with little filling i also think 9 for the light portion is a little steep  finally the service was so slow they were moderately busy but the restaurant should have been able to handle that size of a crowd just fine  in sum the quality of the food could be much better their menu has a lot of items but maybe they should focus on what they can make consistently tastyan unimpressive breakfast establishment with mediocre service and food  my friends and i wanted to find a sitdown breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work after browsing through yelp it seemed like ghinis was the only candidate nearby although their door and website state that they opened at 630am they seemed to be running late and didnt open until 645am we had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes eventually our waiter came and being slightly flustered took our orders quickly i was surprised to find that you cant order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe apparently theyre separate businesses for example you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter strange anyway i ordered the egg provenal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast it really did seem like i had an overcooked order of 6 eggs  just a huge portion off rubbery sadness you might be better off ordering the eggs over easy  the toast was overly buttered as well which is fine if you like it that way the only good thing i had was their cafe au lait which was served in a huge mug my friend had the breakfast sandwich and she thought it was decent with just a few tweaks ghinis can be great but im afraid id go elsewhere for breakfast or brunchthe only reason why the rating isnt lower is that dinner in person at tre lune can be a really nice experience the service and food quality can be top notch  ordering take out is another experience altogether  sure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a montecito restaurant but we didnt realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food qualityconsistency after all isnt food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over  the latest takeout experience involved ordering garganelli with chicken and mushrooms one order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought  on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg we have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal being facetious of course but there doesnt appear to be a way to post those while writing this review keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in  the same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added  our advice  dont order takeout at tre lune  if you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way  ps and no these are not the only examples  there are others but clearly we didnt learn our lesson and continued ordering  the last experience may have sealed the deal for a long whilemy hubby and i ate dinner here last night we expected better food for the price it cost us 3300 and we didnt even have entrees  i got a pulled chicken sandwich on brioche toast with smoked mozzarella cheese the chicken tasted ok but it was kind of dry i guess i should have put some extra sauce on my sandwich the french fries were crispy and flavorful  my husband got a brisket sandwich on brioche toast with mozzarella cheese a side of cole slaw and an order of dry rub wings the brisket was so fatty that my husband left most of the sandwich uneaten the cole slaw was tasty but the dry rub wings were overcooked and dry they looked burnt to me  the only other bbq place in the area is in jenkintown so we will keep bbq bbq in mind i dont think well be eating here too often thoughcame during lunch on a friday  we were allowed to sit immediately which was a good sign however a very large group was using their back private area therefore the available tables in the front room were very deceiving to the expected wait times waves and waves of plates were taken to this apparently huge group in the back before we realized what was going on this of course led to us waiting almost an hour for our two plates in a properly run establishment the decision should be made to not allow more and more patrons to take a seat and order until a reasonable wait time is to be expected we would have even been ok with them having given us a warning as we sat that wait times were going to be much longer than expected very easy step to take the servers were clearly overworked due to managements bonehead decision to allow customers to continue to sit  eventually our food did come but it wasnt worth an hour wait we wanted to like this but bad customer flow management left a bad taste in my mouth   super easy fix guys dont seat people when the wait is going to be that longthe food here was quite good and the ambiance was lovely but the service is what earned 2 stars they take your order bring you water bring over your food and then you never see them again pictured is the french toast and the blonde slinger maybe i would return for to go food but never dining in againjerky is reasonably priced but not high quality by any means have had much better jerky with fewer ingredients and better taste in many other places none of the jerky is made inhouse instead this is a chain operated by a sole proprietor it was a great idea for him to open this place bc it attracts tourists like a magnet but being a local i think my first time shopping there will be my last bought the turkey jerky in teriyaki and pepper flavor and i have to say even the bagged jerky from the grocery store tastes way better the sales guy was kind of meh but i wouldnt say he was rude or aloof just not overtly friendly to each their own but i think theyre trying to push a mass produced jerky that only appears to be homemade overall kind of a tourist trapi really wish i could write a better review for blondies   its the closest coffee shop to me its clean has nice decor and an ok lunch menu   what they lack is service i ordered a half sandwich with the soup du jour and one of my friends ordered the same half sandwich with a different soup after my friends received their meals we waited for mine to arrive and we kept waiting  after we were sure that someone had forgotten my order i flagged down a waitress and told her i was still waiting for my lunch and she replied yeah its coming the soup du jour takes longer because they have to make it right then you know and hurried away what does that mean that they cook each soup of the day to order  if it had been worth the wait this would be a different story but when that small cup of soup finally did come with my 12 sandwich it tasted like salt disappointment upon disappointmentim pretty much with everyone else on this one  kind of a disappointment i had a good time but the night market itself didnt have too much to do with it it was nice to enjoy a comfortable fall evening with friends and people watch with all of the cool people and to have my second helping of capogiro of the day but it was disappointing   it was the first night market so theres obviously some kinks to be worked out and it was obviously advertised a little too well and the extra week to spread the word about it probably didnt help much either the lines were so long the food ran out fast the ceviche was a little small and it seemed a little pricey and unsubstantial and i dropped one of my shrimp and the crowd while lively was oblivious and desperate the stands and trucks were grossly unprepared for the amount of people that showed up hopefully these problems get worked out by the next one  some idiot girl hey idiot girl truth hurts came up to me while i was enjoying my plum  bluecoat ginpistachio gelato and was like is the capogiro free as if she and her friend were floating through the crowd looking for free stuff what uh no nothings free come on night market its built into the title come on  either way this was kind of a bust but i still look forward to the next night marketfood is good service really needs improvement its very obvious there is minimal leadership here hopefully things improve as the restaurant becomes more establishedthe largest mainline grocery store in the immediate area  design and aisle width are a throwback to the 1950s  the prices are high enough that you wont spend that much more getting your topend  fresh items at somewhere like dibruno bros or maxs produce  so that leaves this place for nonperishable items such as canned goods etc  and with a little planning ahead why not buy these outside of the rittenhouse area where you will pay a lot less  ok in a pinch but generally go higher end for your fresh stuff  lower end for your nonperishables if you canthis has always been the only fast food restaurant i will let my kids play in for years it was always clean and well kept but the last several times weve been a serious decline in its cleanliness has occured obviously a kids play area is going to get dirty but the dirt in there now is the stuff that has just been neglected cobwebs and food crumbs are caked into the corners and the cubby holes for shoes you can also tell it no longer gets vacuumed on a regular basis as the dust floating in the air is thick     but this is my main complaint we were just their yestetday a saturday  at noon the place was packed and people were having to stand with their trays waiting for a table at this time two seperate tables were being utilized by a single employee each a two top and a four top both employees casually enjoyed their lunch while playing on there cell phones completely oblivious to all the customers waiting for tables while our food got cold and i personally wrestled with two crabbing kids right in front of the girl employee everyone deserves a break at work but maybe not in the middle of the lunch rush and in the middle of the crowded dining roomif the food want good this would have been just a one star  service is slow the kitchen is ungodly slow and this is in an airport    on top of it bartender dropped my girlfriends food and didnt even say anything to us about it until it showed up 10 minutes after mine     my recommendation is to only order beers here and save the food order for somewhere else that caresmy only complaint with this location is the disgusting bathroom any other target close by such as sicklerville  deptford are way cleaner  this bathroom has only 3 stalls the toilet seats look like they need to be replaced and the entire restroom is obviously never cleaned during the day   they are currently renovating the entire store and hopefully they make the bathroom bigger with new toilet seats at the very leastnot a fan this eatery likes to take originals and put a spin on them just not my stylethis location used to be great the staff have changed over and it absolutely sucks now if you can wait 5 minutes just keep driving youll find another onethis locations seems pretty slow  if you are in a hurry i would suggest you move along  i have been here a handful of time in december 2015 and each time i am finding myself checking my watch out of boredomstrange donuts gets an a for marketing and intrigue  they have done a fantastic job generating buzz kicking out interesting looking creations and building a brand  however the quality behind that brand is lacking at this point  when it comes to donut quality this is where their energies need to be focused  fundamental baking skills are lacking  its more than about how you dress it up its about the quality of the pastry itself  donut drivein and donut stop kick out a highquality pastry no matter the style    strange donuts has brought the magic of voodoo donuts to st louis but they need to focus on the basic  otherwise theyre just cool looking objects in my facebook feedstayed at gsr for reno dance sensation and as a captive audience had a meal at johnny rockets  the amount of fries served with a burger was a little skimpy and at 6 for a malt it seemed waaaaaay over priced  the malt had good flavor but was runnier than i prefer  onion rings should be ashamed of themselves  not even close in flavor to being worth the calories  burger was average got the bacon one  fry flavor was pretty good  i liked the presentation of the smiley face of ketchup in the dipping dish  service was friendly  quick enoughworst experience first time here ordered me and my kids food got it my order was wrong so i told them waited 10 more minutes my kids finished eating as i sat there panicking about my food got a refund for mine and left so frustrating my order wasnt difficult at all i really was looking forward to liking this place now well never knowtoday i brought my mother to this particular location for the 12 off  frappuccino  they posted signs saying that they have a broken blender and are short staffed  so regardless of our wait that might be to come we went in anyways  speed of service was great  they got the frappuccinos 4 of them within a few minutes  not realizing they cut all the corners they could to get our order out  my mother and grandmother ordered light carmel  frappuccinos  and my father and i ordered the new carmel waffle cone frappuccinos  when we enter the building werent greeted or welcomed in and there wasnt a smile on anyones face they seemed stressed due to being short staffed  my mother found chucks of ice in her drink which was suppose to be blended and her frappuccino and my grandmas both had waffle crumbles on top when that wasnt even what they ordered   also to top it all off the store was dirty and no one had a smile or a good attitude when i brought it to someones attention that my frappuccino was wrong i ordered it with no coffee  he snatched the cup from me threw it away and proceeded to make me the new one  my dad ordered that same frappuccino  and could have taken the mess up home instead of throwing it in the trash   over all may main question is  as a store manager or a store owner  why werent you there  why wasnt someone there to fix or replace the blender and help with the under staffed shift   hmmm maybe we have a management problem with this store  over all not a good visitspoke too soon about the service that is    we were in last evening for a birthday monday evening and the service was horrible they werent busy at all it was 730 and only 2 tables outside and maybe 6 or 7 inside were sat  the server took our order after bringing our drink order 3 of usonly to never be seen again she didnt check on us oncethe entire time someone else brought our food no one asked us if everything was okay with our dinners no one asked if we needed another drink no one removed our plates no one asked if we needed anything else and no one asked if we wanted to order dessert for the birthday we were there to celebrate and yes we told our sever right after we sat down  we realize they dont do anything special for birthdays we didnt need a big deal made but not even giving us the option to order a piece of chocolate cake only two deserts from which to choose is just poor service    finally i asked my husband to go inside and find our sever so we could pay our bill mind you drinks have been empty for last half of the meal and all plates remain on the tablewith silverware stacked and napkins on plates  she was sitting at the host stand playing on the computer ummmmreally    my husband paid the bill right there came back outside to get us and we got up to leave  at this point i was at least expecting her to say something as we walked out passed the host stand to leave server is still sitting there on computerand not one word not a hey sorryi hope your meals were okay or a sorry i was helping out in back or even a gosh i just completely forgot i had a table and my job is to take care of you as a way to earn a tipnopenada  i wont say her name on this forum but sadly upland tap house im not sure we will be back any time soon  we have been telling everyone about how great your place is but now we most likely just wont mention you at all  sad how one bad server can ruin the reputation of a great place  and yes i would have loved to speak to a manager and give my feedback right then and there but at that point we just wanted to get out of there and salvage the birthday girls night  such a bummerthought we had found our favorite neighborhood go tocouldnt be more disappointed was really looking forward to having a gyro the lamb gyro is not a gyro plain greek yogurt in a pita with chunks of lamb should be lamb cooked on a spit and shaved off should be tzaziki should have flavor gross wheres the flavor get it together do people here not know any better or do the just not carei work in a restaurant so i never thought id write a yelp review let alone a bad one but im hoping that management here is as crazy as my boss is about yelp reviews and the problem will get fixed because i love the food here twice now however ive gotten hair in my burrito once i can let slide but twice is a pattern and it really grossed me out the staff seems to be mostly young girls with long hair it looks like maybe they have a rule about keeping it covered because theyre always wearing hats but they wear them very loosely with long messy strands hanging down honestly they might as well not even wear the hats like i said i love the food here and its a shame i feel like i cant eat here anymoreive eaten here 3 or 4 times and havent had very good experiences food is well below average bar food seems like they buy super low end frozen ingredients service has been just okay there seem to be tons of people working just not a lot getting done beer list is good which is why ive been back not sure ill ever eat here againjust okay if you need a place to come and get a fancy cocktail then this is your place do not expect great service but if you are coming in for one drink and then moving on this would be a good place to starti had the gyro plate and was totally dissatisfied   the meat was so dry  the turkish and israeli shwarma is way better anywhere else  the server was friendly but food is priority    now the bakery next store is a straight rip off  they dont display prices for a good reason  once you choose your pastries youll be surprised after the cashier tells you your damage  the baklava was loaded with honey way too sweet and barely edible    this place is simply a tourist trapbrand spanking new opening  the pho here looks better than the ones from saigon express around the corner but their dry dishes vermicelli and rice plates did not make me happynot at all  i ordered the bbq beef vermicelli with fried egg roll when i received my food there was a bowl full of vermicelli one egg roll about 15 inches long cut into two bite sized pieces and a handfull of lettuce   thats not what its supposed to look like its supposed to have carrots and bean sprouts and more meat and more egg roll and whatsup with the fish sauce isnt it supposed to be orangey red why did they give me a soysaucy oneis that something thats usually put it in im not used to it   this is not a review of their pho so when and if i do go back i will updatewent to buy a package for a friends whos grandfather passed away we wanted to spend 80 and when i went to pick the package up today i was embarrassed it was on a dinner sized plate and looked like it probably cost 25 we did choose a lot of chocolates to go into the package which are 1995 a pound but for 80 the package shouldve been close to 4 lbs  and it wasnt the only positive thing i will say is that they let us return the package because we were not satisfied but in the future i would not go theremy brother and i went there and thought we had found the place to go  all the employees were talking to so many of the customers  we soon found out that they were all regulars or at least they all knew each other  no one stopped by to chat us up and see how our meal was  our server was good and the pizza was good  the alfredo sauce was real good  all in all we spent way too much money to not feel very welcomed or even get a thank you on the way outyour staff is great and really friendly but for the life of me i cannot understand why you would get rid of the self check out during the renovation process you would only have two checkout lanes open with lines stretching down the aisle for someone that stopped in for three or four items the self check out would have been great to get customers like me in and out of the store but you felt the need to get rid of them now you are opening up a battery of express lanes not really staying competitive with other local markets in my opinioni came here this morning to grab a sandwich because they seriously have the best reuben in town unfortunately neither of the two girls working were concerned about taking an order i saw one making a salad and she never spoke despite seeing me after a few minutes another girl walked behind me went behind the counter and disappeared without speaking i looked at the one making the salad and began to ask about service when the other slowly reappeared and acted like it was a hassle to take an order i left because it was obvious she didnt want to be there i can wait for service as long as someone speaks or acts like they care neither happenedthis place would be ok if they would use utensils when handling food  when you see the guys fingers touching every added bit to a salad and grabbing the handles on equipment refrigerators without resanitizing it makes me want to puke  parking in back at lunchtime is not guaranteed and good luck parking on hollister  seating is very limitednote to donut owner you might as well just close at 10am no sense in staying open until 2pm if you only sell the rejects left over from breakfast   for my 1st experience i admit it wasnt a normal donut eating time but i figured heck they close at 200pm its only 1145am ill give it a shot i asked for their specialty croissant donut cronut that i have seen on reviews i was told oh we sold those this morning i thought to myself hmm you are open 2 more hours you cant fry some up for me i should have asked but i didnt shame on me    instead of offering to make some now the donut worker said he can make them for me tomorrow and save them so they are left for me arg not making me happy mr i said no thank you with a smile and left   its a shame cuz i really wanted to give this little local shop a try why cant local shops run like a krispy cream hot and fresh all the timeoh eeffocs your coffees still good your food has actually improved in quality but dear godthis place is so so poorly managed ive lost count of how many saturday mornings ive spent waiting 30 minutes for a bagel with cream cheese or how many times i was blatantly ignored by the staff or how many times my order was just plain forgotten after it was placed and paid for its a shame this place would be awesome if it was managed by people who know how to run a coffee shop and who know customer service if you hire young teens to man your counters you better train them damn well i imagine this place stays in business due to the heavily trafficked corner it sits on and its continuously rising prices i get it i only go back if a friend wants to meet me there for coffee but thats it jonas you make the perfect iced coffee but i just cant justify giving you any more business than thatjust had maybe the worst chipotle in the country there was no flavor to the food at all like i am used to at chipotle and half way into my burrito bowl me and my girlfriend both found raw chicken and steak that was totally raw and pink in the middle never even got warmed up portions were kinda small too but i eat a lot so no matter what i want more at least the staff was nice but chips and guac isnt compensation for the 10 worth of food that i ended up throwing awayhave seen the commercials for the stuffed french toast  have always thought i should  try it   i should have just ordered pancakes   stuffed french toast with peach vanilla arrived completely cold when the server came back to check five minutes later she asked if it was microwave cold or completely cold from that i surmise that its pulled from a freezer  heated in a microwave   i ate some of my husbands hash browns thankfully they removed it from my bill  were very apologetic but i will never again order based on an ihop commercial plarge assortment of food but am annoyed that the lunch buffet price changes frequentlythis winter it was 995 for a time but today it was back to 1295 we found their roll menu average and a bit heavy  hot buffet has american fried selections seems more like a 995 value to usnot planning to go back as frequentlyit has been a long time since ive been to hendricks  i was excited to go again  such a disappointment  the server really couldnt be bothered with doing anything other than the absolute minimum  then there was the food  between several of us we sampled most of the sides  the mac and cheese was the only stand out  the sauces were not thick and rich like i remember  they were al very thin and watery    i dont feel the need to go back again not with so many great bbq places in the areathough i love the ice cream the workers never seem to smile or act like they care i feel like im bothering them by coming in it took the girl forever to make 2 simple ice creams and 2 groups of people that came in after us left before we even got rung upattending dining under the stars in media this past wednesday night what a great experience the dining experience on the other hand not so much   our waiter was rude and pushyrushy i will give him the benefit of the doubt although we had our reservations at 845 and looking around it didnt seem to be that busy  i ordered the gnoicchis with red meat sauce specifically asking for them to be cooked firm he assured us that is how they are made come to find out they were not in fact they had a texture like mashed potatoes   would not recommend50 for an incredibly average meal and two beers actually it wasnt good enough to be average i got the 16 ounce ribeye with a baked potato and applesauce   the steak was thin and fairly bland i got it smothered with onions sauted mushrooms and cheese i assumed the cheese would be crumbled like blue cheese is in most steak places but it wasnt it was basically thick liquid cheese poured over the steak i would not recommend the cheese on the steak maybe i didnt pay close enough attention to the description of the toppings in the menu the applesauce was out of a jar the potato was what youd expect   i sat at the bar the girls working the bar were very friendly but very busy and very very loud they should have more help on a friday night because i had to wait several minutes for my second beer and then again for my check the manager was also behind the bar but she didnt seem to be motivated to do any actual work   in future i will cook my own steak bought from publix for about 15 and drink my own beer 6 for about 10 and spend half as much   i will not be going backi was attracted by the reviews which were enticing the service was deficient by delivering the order by piecemeal and lukewarm food wrong choiceservice is disgusting horrible experience bartender t was rude  she gave us an attitude because we sat down at 1230am at bar i understand that they close at 1ambut we were looking to grab a quick snack after a long drive from out of state she slammed our drinks down on bar and even had her regulars say harassing things to us food was decentthats why i gave it 25 starsa few things really bothered me about this place a they told me they were out of boba when in fact someone came up after me and ordered a drink with one and they continued to make excuseslie to me about what happened b their quail was over cooked very dry c how do you have a thai restaurant with no sweet chili sauce summer roll was ok nothing to run home about and their roast pork bahn mi was good but mostly consisted of bread idk if ill be backwe were mistakenly referred to this place and less than average is all i can say they have great green beans and collards pretty goodribs burnt like jerky and no real meat the waitstaff was very friendly and took back my ribs and brought me a pulled pork sandwich as i ask for which though was fresh had no flavor when front of house mgr ask about us she mentioned shed get the kitchen mgr and bring him overafter waiting 57 minutes since we were paid up and done we left i mentioned to another waitress on way out to tell her we wouldnt wait any more and wont be back dont eat ribs or pulled pork no flavor and way to burnt n dry  22 for full rack of ribs burnt no flavor this would be a good price if ribs were really good this all on the 4 of july at 530 i would pass and go elsewhereordered a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie to go opened it to find a snickerdoodle unimpressedwe were very disappointed reviews rated baileys best burger in the lou this was not our experience burger a poivre was very dry matchmeat was dry and tasteless     the one highlight was the fries great fries and thankfully sheila was a wonderful server  we would not place baileys in the top ten burgers in st louiswhen we sat down and read the menu  we thought we had found a gem the selections look absolutely inspiring and delicious   what we ordered horchata boozy milkshake lime in the coconut chicken burger from their burger war of the week fries  the horchata was very very tasty  thick and creamy  but hardly felt or tasted any of the alcohol in it  so was disappointed to be paying 9 for essentially a milkshake   the burger  at a price of 11 for a burger alone no sides included we had expectations of a decent sized burger  and with neither of us being overly hungry we decided to split  we were very disappointed by the serving size  the burger was so tiny that it would have hardly fed one of us if we were hungry  as for taste  well we left underwhelmed  the chicken burger was very dry and had little flavor of its own and weve had some incredible chicken burgers before  the toppings were nothing at all reminiscent of lime or coconut and were very very sparse   the fries  here the serving size was ginormous  we did not expect that many fries for 2 which i guess is a good thing since our burger was so tiny   they were tasty and loved all the choices of dipping sauces     kudos however for gluten free buns at no up charge the texture was way off on it but at least it held together   the building itself was interesting but the acoustics downright miserable we couldnt even talk to one another across the table it was so loud in there    so all and all this place held a lot of potential for us that it just didnt live up toworstrun operation in nashville the food is delicious and the setting is ultra cool but the service can hardly be referred to as such after years in business they still havent gotten it together sadly today was their last chance from meso friendly so welcoming but dirty im no germaphobe my house is vacuumedmoppeddusted once weekly at best and i find these conditions crusty my goodness yall try dusting the window sill where i am sitting out in the open was caked in dust til i cleaned it in haste cant get my work done in these conditions wobbly tables are remedied with dirty newspaper wedges looks nasty they should try switching out these paper wedges more frequently or try out one of the many other ways to fix a wobbly piece of furniture  google is a gem seriously yall i cant stress enough how grimy your restaurant is and from a dining establishment these conditions are unacceptable i expect more from the 1 rated coffee shop in gambit dont get the health ppl here theyll shut yall down unless yall have some routine hypercleaning spree to prep for their arrivalstopped here on my way out of philly i had to see what the buzz was about  the short rib tacos were sold out so i had to choose between the capn crunch burrito and chicken satay tacos i chose the burrito and i think i chose wrong its just fried tilapia with spicy sauce it was not nasty by any means but just really really basic   i also ordered the mango tea too too sweet for my taste and they only take cash which was a bummer so i had to run to the atm and pay an atm fee   service was fast and customer service was greative been to baileys plenty of times with my girlfriend when we drive down to saint louis and let me tell you this was my worst experience first off we come in and the people greeting were extremely nice there was a gentlemen with great fashion then we sit at the bar and everything goes downhill we sit down and the waiterbartender what ever he is instantly we can all tell he came off like an absolute ahole he has a red haired beard and glasses we wait 15 minutes for him just to take our order we order and before we can get our last words out   ill get that rang in for you guys  like dude ok then our milkshakes came then our food and let me tell you he could not have cared less about customers he cared more about the people drinking and got mad when i asked for ice with my hot water i dont know if he had a bad night or what but we will not be going backi would agree with all of the negative reviews but not because of the rudenesswhich they were not but new york bagels they were not   these were nothing like the manhattan bagel shops i have been to they were perfectly round and did not have the nyc taste not to mention what self respecting bagel shop microwaves their eggs what a disappointment   skip this place you are better off unfortunately going to paneragood concept but questionable execution the half pound cookies are a must have we tried one for our family of four with ice cream as a sundae cookie was phenomenal but the hot fudge tasted burned it was horrible i get the sense that quality here is inconsistent also 10 for a cookie and two scoops of ice cream not cool try the italian gelato available across the street or at many places along mandalay avei like the atmospheretried three different donuts but i was not thrilled with any of the flavors wish we had ordered sliders and frieswell i am always in the market for good pizza and i guess i am still looking not sure i like this new assembly line pizza the employees were all nice and helpful but that only goes so far with a mediocre product we ordered a gluten free pizza for laura and threw away most of it i was originally happy to see that it wasnt a premade crust after trying it it should have been it was super thin and super hard they offer a build your own pizza but really skimp on the sauce cheese and toppings in order to get a pizza that would be what i would want i had to keep asking for additional sauce cheese and toppings not sure if the guy running the pizza oven knew what he was doing i understand the place is new but someone from their corporate office should have done a better job training what would lebron say if he knewi arrived at 630 waited in a 25 minute line barely any chicken in my salad bowl and the chips were incredibly stale total disappointmentfirst time here and purchased a 6 inch cake for 15 a little pricey for such a small cake it was very dry and the icing fell off the cake once i cut into it the part that put me over the edge was that i found not one but two strings  maybe coarse hair in the cake very disappointing for my husbands birthday i give two stars because the employees were friendlyhonestly the rudest employees walked in waited at least 8 minutes for them to come over when they werent busy at all i was the only person in the place so i finally order and i get a medium iced coffee and then ask if i get a free donut national donut day today which they have been advertising she responds super annoyed yeah and turns around to grab a random donut when i asked for a plain glazed she says you dont get to pick your donut and starts talking in another language to me and then to the other employee i tell her i couldnt understand her and she ignores me snatches the bag and grabs the random donut she put in there puts it back and gets my glazed donut acts all annoyed and tells me again that i cant pick my own donut but shell do it interesting because the advertisements say otherwise overall terrible experiencei always love attending these types of events especially if it involves food the south street night market 81513 was way too crowded that we were only able to try three food trucks and thats only because each of us stood in line individually for 1hr to get the food   was pretty disappointed with surf and turf trucks lobster rolls as it was all bread and no lobster the samosas at samosa deb were good but the line moved way too slow for having only 20 people ahead of you another truck with the walking taco amazing but sorry forgot the name made me like fritos chips again with its mix of pulled pork and beans in the fritos bag and their porknado was tasty too but by the time the bf got back to me with it the soft pretzel was no longer soft   they had a cute concept with printing out instagram pictures but we werent able to find ours   i think ill pass on future night market unless there is some better crowd control because this was insane and the worst i have experienced at food eventssince yelp does not allow us to report people for their inaccuracy intelligence or hearing insufficiency i will update my review to state to sue c on july 22 notice your review is not even recommendedshows how great your perceptionopinion is maybe yelp is smart after all  no profanity was used in the entire episode over this cake  we said they will be reported on all online sites and the next time i want to speak to a real manager who is over 12  you just showed your ignorance  stay off yelp please as you add nothing to the conversation and should really find something to do we did report you for having affiliations with parrot petes as that would be the only reason anyone would take the time to get on yelp and lie i mean how sad really  shame on you too and i hope something like this happens to you on one of the most special days of your life or to someone you love    with that said i updated the review to 2 stars since someone another manager maybe did respond to our review on facebook to offer a refund and to say the employee was dealt with and they are very sorry  so sue c you can rest assured as you continue with your sad life and go there twice a week that your favorite little restaurants average just increased a very small amounti dont want to say that the last thing this town needs is another chain pizza placebut if it doesit sure as heck had better be fantastic   not the case here  after a painful 20 mins of trying to navigate their on line ordering i just gave up  the pics looked so great and there were some pretty good reviews here on trusty old yelp so i called in   it was a saturday night and they were busy  even ordering over the phone was kind of a painbut we got though it  the food came in less time than they estimated the delivery guy was very nice and seemed to have his act together  but then we tried to eat the pizza and that is where we made our mistake   the pizza was very thin and had nearly no crust  normally this wouldnt upset me too muchbut the whole idea behind this places gimmick is that they offer so many flavored crusts  the pizza was slightly worse than the 1 titinos ya buy at the super market and roughly the same size  and it was 16   there were wings too  not nearly as disappointing as the pizza but most definitely from frozen preseasoned and just bad   the only reason i gave howies two stars was because of the sandwich  thank goodness my far better half had a craving for an italian sub or our meal wouldve been a complete waste of time and money  the sandwich was a little different  it seemed to be made out of a folded pizza crust it was pretty tasty and fairly large considering the very low price i would even consider returning if only for the italian sub  i think it was priced under 5 and fed us both  though we did have some bites of awful pizza and substandard wings to help get us through  anyway if cheap food is what youre afterhave at it  if quality is your thing skip this place  it is an embodiment of what is wrong with chain restaurantsother reviews spot on  you wait to be seated but they will text you   you wait at the table to served you wait to get food  plan at least 15 hours for breakfast  eggs benedict egg was overcooked and hard  bummerif krispy kreme is a donut shop then why is it so hard to get a fresh donut my boyfriend came home with a dozen and a half of their cream filled and they were extremely chewy dry to the touch and stale tasting what a bummer youd think theyd sell fast enough to keep them coming fresh so if that isnt a testament to how their business is sliding downhill then i dont know what isthis place is definitely not built for speed these guys are very very slow after 11 pm if you want something in a hurry do not come here they take forever i will probably not visit this location againtried one dish broccoli with zoodles noodles made from zucchini and potatoes salmon was added the salmon was very good the zoodles alright the broccoli was yellowed tinged with age and tasteless the home fried potatoes were mushy and also tasteless based on this dish i would not return to bff of course others may be betteras a business owner why would you close up and lock the doors at 1050 if you dont close until 1100 on a saturday night the chicken is awesome but the service is beyond horrible they give a whole new  definition to the word rude  we will definitely limit our visits im not a fan of bad servicei am confused by all the positive reviews this place has gotten  the atmosphere was fine and the coffee fine but the service was unfriendly and the food wasnt great at all  honestly all the people that worked there looked like they hated life and it was the worst place in the world to work  none of them smiled in the 15 hours i was there  as far as the food it was 4 for scrambled eggs and 1 for any add ons you want ie spinach onions cheese etc ok fine thats reasonable but seriously it was the smallest portion ever and didnt even taste as good as homemade scrambled eggs  total let down  i thought any place could make decent eggs but apparently not  i really wanted to like this place but sadly was really let down10 minimum on charge really the donuts are subpar the service is atrocious the coffee is ehh instead of going here next time take a short trip down hampton ave and go to st louis hills donut shop youll have much better resultsif youre going to pay 5 for a scoop of something go to jenis expected something great was delivered something okay aesthetically they are trying to be five daughters but the location is off take your risk with eggs staff was nice there was also a nice sign in the bathroomthe only thing worth getting 2stars were the sweet potatoe fries  i dont know but i would think if all you do are burgers then you could get the temperature right  i ask for a prime burger med rare and it came out well done  also the bottom of my bun was over toasted so it started to fall apartnot a good experiencecame here for an event and had buffet here i came here multiple times and i feel like the food is getting worst and worst its neat that you can make your own shabu shabu here but the broth is not goodunless you boil it for 30 minutes with some soy sauce and meats this place is clean and big for a buffet but it lacks variety of the food stay away really stay away from the soba noodles it tastes so bad i never had a soba noodles that blend in my life their sushi and rolls are okay but not the freshest if you get the salmon right when they put it on the platter expected to be little frozen but in the end you get what you pay forso was there today w my family and victoria was our server i ordered a chicken caesar wrap and it had about 8 pieces of small chicken bites in it they cut it in half and one side probably had 3 pieces of chicken it would of been much better if there was chicken in it i ordered a to go order and i know the waitress forgot we were all done w our food and i asked her where the to go order was and she said it should be right up then she disappeared and came back 10mins later w our order she also slammed our glasses down when she brought our drinks over not a happy customer manager needs to walk around and ask his customers how their meal wasits just too long a wait in winter outside  i think id be happier coming at an offtime weekday in nicer weather parking is problematicthe past four times ive ordered online each order was wrong all four times once the order was so wrong they took half of the ingredients in my moms salad and put it in my brothers steak bowl they took half of the ingredients in my brothers steak bowl and put them in my moms salad they are complete opposites and ended up not eating either of their meals how do you mix up an online order that bad the ingredients are all listed for you my order has also been completely wrong before its like i get someone elses bowl and thy take the lid with my name on it and stick it on someone elses bowl i used to go here once a week havent been there in a month now which really is unfortunate because i love their food staff is a mix of nice and rude depending on who you get wish i had a better run location near mei hate to say it but other reviews were right burgers were decent onion rings inedible due to grease my kids fries needed to be pressed with napkins and the service was terrible service was terrible waited over an hour with a 3 year old for our burgers i love their wings but dont think ill eat in there again we actually tipped another server that took care of us i think ryan was his name place was not busy when we got there  damn it its so close with such a good beer selection sorry pub youre almost there but need some efficiencies put in place or a talent reviewreally unsure what the fuss is all about with this place   as ramona p mentioned in her review the counter help is a hit or a miss ive stopped by here on multiple trips to new orleans and every time im hoping for a better experience ill subject myself to rude staff if the offerings are primo  but alas even the fabled hamandcheese croissant is lackluster  chelsea ms review mentioning the coffee is akin to breakroom coffee is spot on as well  what i do like about this patisserie is its proximity to tulane that its located on maple street really a cool area and that their pastries are a nice treat but unfortunately not the best nola has to offerthe bagels were ok nothing worth raving about  but poor customer service in my opinion and a 10 credit card minimumits 2011 really  i wont be back there id rather drive a bit farther and get a friendly smile and be able to charge 6went with 8 friends for wine and something light to eat it was a friday night but not really busy there were empty tables  we studied what was on offer the server was helpful  we ordered six appetizers to share and each ordered a flight of wine you could order their selection or build your own flight you could select three  the wine was just ok i preferred the riesling while the others the chardonnay neither were impressive  the appetizers were just ok too no one was impressed  it was difficult to get the servers attention we either had to wave arms of go to them  we all agreed there was no need to returnthis mcdonalds is ok for the most part via drive thru but dont waste your time going insidethe whole drink area is really old and looks like its about to fall apart the ventilation in there sucks so the whole place usually smells pretty gross like another reviewer also said this place is sometimes not serving certain items after midnight and theyll refuse to make them for youi read a number of bad reviews before i went to momo but decided to try it anyway because we were in the area first off the place was empty but i had to keep looking for my server every time i ordered shed come back ten minutes later saying they were out of whatever i ordered when i finally decided on something they werent out of my entree showed up this place says they serve ramen but this isnt ramen its a bowl full of chili oil and onion water i was pretty disappointedwhelp my friends and i was super excited to find this truck we heard so much about it because one of my friends followed it on twitter trying to catch it in his neighborhood finally we found it and ordered the cheese curds for eight dollars and we spent another 50 each on a dipping sauce the people there were friendly enough and explained to us the difference between mozzarella sticks and what they were offering and seemed very confident that it would be better than anything weve had so excitedly we went in for a taste  of the four of us one didnt care for them at all and would not eat a second one the other three of us thought they were okay but nothing to write home about but none of us could finish them  too much cheese i would have preferred that mine wouldve been breaded a little bit heavier and fried a little bit longer so they were crispier but what we kind of ended up with was a bit of a soggy mess we were very surprised due to all the raves and sadly disappointed i think with the amount of money you spend for them youre really hoping for a better experience if they had cost less we would have had lowered expectations the reviews and cost raised the bar so would i buy them again or recommend someone else buy them well if you like mozzarella sticks these are a creamier version and would do the job but there is not enough of a difference in this item for me to buy them againthe casino is under major construction so getting in and out are kind of hectic but its a nice facility i have two major issues here though 1 the hard rock brand in and of itself is an experience for customers whether or not its the casino a restaurant or a museum therefore people who work there should be expert enough on the brand and tourist attractions to guide customers and answer basic questions about the primary thing that makes hard rock a brand the legendary items and artifacts that are the basis of the business no one who worked there could direct us to any of the artifacts we were looking for not even the two people at the information desk thats really a disadvantage to the organization and lessens the enjoyment for the customer if they have to walk all around the casino to look for a picture of prince or patti labelles dress they need to have some sort of manual or chart that documents where things are and the workers need to be trained on it too 2 my second issue is that their food court absolutely sucks for this to be such a big casino and such a big tourist attraction they need to expand their food offerings there are like 3 food court options and then theres the hard rock restaurant which isnt of interest to lots of people being that the food is mediocre at all of them ive been to several hard rock restaurants across the country and the food is consistently mediocre and chainy unfortunately the food court offers no rescue eitherthe staff here on multiple occasions has had their hands no gloves in the chips eating right out of the chip tub in front of me so freaking grossit just gets worse  now they have dropped their early bird special was looking for something else to try on that menu as the chicken parm was not good nowhere near enough sauce but this is a moot point as they just disenfranchised a lot of customersi love bareburger and the two star review is purely for the service  for such a small establishment the wait time was actually ridiculous  im completely patient and can understand a wait time ive chosen to come in at a busy hour coming here twice in the same week with indifferent service staff and waits up to 20 minutes for the first swing by for drink orders and then 30 minutes for the food seemed excessivehands down the worst bbq place ever  the crispy chicken sandwich was 3 chicken tenders on a soft roll with nothing else  the bbq chicken was dry and overcooked  the sauce was great and that should have given a little container of it to make the dry tasteless chicken go down easier  the baked beans were pretty good thats the only reason they got a 2 stars from me  i will definitely not be going backin short the parts of my experience was better than the whole i ordered the fishermens special which isnt on the menu its supposed to come with avocado which they were out of asked for lightly toasted bagel it was burnt around the edges it didnt taste like it had scallion spread on it and for 1074 it seems overpriced for what i  received the nova was okay as was the whitefish salad which i picked off because my bagel was burnt  back to real jewish delis trying to diversifylike others i want to love this place but the prices are high and the donuts didnt impress me  no where to sit and eat your donuts so they have to be for takeoutgreat for higher quality food items but my only complaint is the slow lazy baggers and checkers they act like they just woke up or something and its mid day from all of my experiences there over a couple years the baggers always put unlike items together in the same bag like bleach with my milk etc if you want a good experience here go through selfcheckout youll guarantee a proper bagging of your items and they wont dribble the items down the conveyer belt and bruise and squish your stuff twice ive said something to the store manager and she just defends them but trust me you can smell crazy on her she seems a little off in my opinionservice was terrible i was so upset since it was a small group of us for two of our friends birthday and unfortunately the server ruined our whole night    first when he greeted the first of us from our party he says hi ill get your drink order when the rest of the party is here umm no i would like a drink please  it took 45 min for our food to come and not once did he stop by our table to keep us updated  he passed out our food without speaking a word while he did so  all of the burgers were dry and cold  the fries were hot but soggy  he never came back to ask how it was so we had to flag down a different server who also seemed to not give a sht  we finally just wanted to get the hell out of there and it took 20 min to cash out which he had added gratuity for this awful experience without again saying a thing or even a thank you   so disappointed by the service and food quality this time aroundhavent been there in sometime and will not be racing back wonder if it actually may be going out of business we walked in and were hit with a strong very unpleasant odor there were no customers in there most flavors were on vacation everything looked dirty and unappetizing i wouldve left but my daughter had her heart set on some fro yoused to come here cause it was cheap and relatively good not anymore they raised their prices and the quality of food has gone down drasticallyif you like and enjoy lots of sodium and grease this is your place im not sure but it seems they may dip burger in butter at any rate flavor is filled with grease and fat   homer simpson would love this place fries were very saturated as wellgood pizza  crust is proper and toppings are generous  some creative choices available  if you dont like slices and i dont the smallest pie you can order is 16  i think a 10 or a 12 would be a wise offering especially if you want to sell some of your other menu items that brings me to my next point  what is the deal with the afterthought sushi bar  its totally out of place and the obviously low turnover rate of the contents would put off any sushi lover note to ownersmanagers  you cannot run a restaurant to serve as a hangout for your family and friends and still expect normal customers to be comfortable  most of the small dining area was occupied by a large group just filling up space and encouraging their many children to have the run of the place  bad for business   this was not a good experience and i would not return  probably a moot point because i dont see this place surviving unless some sweeping changes are madethe cold brew coffee is either not cold brewed a terrible brand of coffee or it was brewed days ago it is so incredibly stale i am pretty upset i paid 3 for this   everything else though is delicioustoday i was extremely annoyed i always place an online order because i like to get my food and get out right away today i placed an online order to be ready by 300 pm i arrive inside the building at 304 and as i wait to pay i realize it is not ready nor has it been started i see the woman at the register print my order and hand it to the workers on the line to start i was in a hurry to get lunch back to my brother before he left the house and i ended up not making it home in time i waited 20 minutes until i received my order considering this is not the first time this has happened it irritates me even more the point of an online order is for me to come in and receive my order on time the staff could tell how annoyed i was and didnt even apologize for my wait super disappointedthis was my first visit to the broad ripple hotbox i will not be going back we paid 2015 for a large thin crust pizza and an order of breadsticks the large pizza was the size of a medium most other places ive been it was supposed to have extra cheese it didnt on top of that it was overdone and dry it was one of the worst pizzas ive ever had definitely not worth the money we all were wishing we had gotten a little caesars for 5  not a good showing hotboxthis place is a hit or miss been here three times and its been a miss twice i just moved to keswick village and i was so excited to have a place to get bubble tea and sushi within walking distance i got bubble tea here the first day i moved and was annoyed because they didnt seem to understand what i was ordering and i was making myself very clear most of my anger erased when i mostly ended up getting what i ordered had chinese here with a large group no problems not the best not the worst tried to get bubble tea here again hoping maybe it was just the person i originally dealt with but alas no too frustrating to order a dang bubble tea from here and i now get my chinese take out from yummy yummy   i am disappointi ordered the sweet potato hash with 2 eggs the eggs were too well done but the hash was good i also had a biscuit which was soggy my husband had french toast monte cristo the bread was still doughy and not cooked enough the only reason i have it two stars instead of one star is because they did refund our money for the monte cristo and the waiter was great but we wont be returning to this restaurantice cream is great as usual could not eat it in the shop because of the obnoxious rap music being playedi always hope to find a good local place to get my daily iced mocha but unfortunately it just didnt happen here i live in both southern ca and st petersburg and in california i drink peets nordstroms and that national brand so thats what i am use to a rich sweet and creamy taste of mocha yesterday i went through the drive through and placed my order when at the window to pick up was asked if i wanted sweetener added huh why i mean its a mocha not a diet drink i was told that the iced mocha comes unsweetened and if i want it sweetened i must request that so ok go for it what i got was a rather bland watery drink for almost 5 its a total disappointment   why is it so hard to find a decent iced mocha in this town  maybe the hot drinks are good but thats not what i drink500 degrees burgers sansom and 15th st are delicious but when your concept is nononsense chow that you specialize in one item and cut on all nonessential your process should be frightfully efficient and it really  isnt once past the admittedly good order taking two burgers shouldnt take 15 mn to prepare  and fries think crispy next time limp lukewarm fries that have been sitting over the fryer for the 15 mn it  takes to prepare the burger belong to one place only the trash can   also hygiene much you might want to work on that i saw a guy bring a box of tomatoes obviously not washed they still had the stickers on and you dont put washed tomatoes back in their box and then he cut them on the cardboard that is just asking for trouble and sick customers  not coming backthe service is exactly what i expect from a fast food joint  slow and lousy    food is served lukewarm  double check anything you get from the drive thru  dont expect fries to be cooked thoroughly  and dont dare ask what kind of salad dressing they havesome of the best ice cream in town but they keep closing earlier and earlier without notice it use to be 12 on a friday or saturday then 11 now 10loud and expensive for subpar tasting food but the wait staff was nice the burger meat tastes strangelike theres absolutely no seasoning in the ground beef or something also they make their own ice cream cones in the lobbyice cream shop which smelled amazing when we went to go look the cone irons were filthy with rawhalf cooked  batter piled up right next to the finished productslowest fast food ever always owner needs to quite being a cheapskate and staff the place dont go if you are in any hurry at alllike all good things it always comes to an end 500 degrees end is now   during the summer i tried the mini rouge burger for the first time with some coworkers although not entirely like the rouge the 500 degrees burger was the next best thing i deemed it one of the best if not the best fast food burger i have ever tried better than five guys and even better than innout if i wrote the review back then it would probably be 45  but that was then what happened did they change chefsownerssomething i ordered the classic combo with truffle fries and the strawberry milkshake while my lady got the burger of the week with the fried egg we waited anxiously around 10 minutes and our number was called we prepare to unravel the anticipated greatness to come and bam did i just get punkd   everyone take a look at the photos that other yelpers have submitted beautiful little thing isnt it this night not so much my burger was sloppily put together the bun was squished and not at all like the glossy and puffy bun i remembered bad start so far and it does not get better since they messed up my order and replaced my mushrooms with cooked red onions after removing that i took a huge bite to feed my burning appetite meh i ordered medium rare and it came out medium to medium well i remember the burger oozing its glorious juices all over my arm after the first bite this was just a disgrace  her burger was not much better either the burger was also put together like the mcdonalds down the street from me nasty the egg had already popped and left a watery mess she didnt even finish the burger that doesnt make me feel too proud after talking up the 500 degrees burger for so long  the truffle fries barely tasted like truffles it actually tasted normal but was decent it could have been a bit crunchier since i hate limp fries   the milkshake was the highlight of our meal but then again who messes up a milkshake   yes this was a long review for a horrible experience yes i am a little harsh on a relatively positive establishment but hey it must have been a bad night or something for this place to completely change from my last experience i will not return i ask for a favor to the next person who read this review and tried the burger take a picture for me and let me know if it was just a bad night for themmegreen beans from can warmed up as a side dish was a disappointment dry grilled mahi mahi turist traplet me first start out by saying that the food is fantastic so i guess your asking why two stars then im giving it two stars because on mondays the live band is horrible and the band is so loud that it is impossible to talk to anyone at your table even if they are sitting right next to you its a mexican establishment not even playing mexican music i highly recommend avoiding this place at least on mondaysthe staff deserve 45 stars but theyre closed randomly and its statring to deteriorate eat there before it starts sucking great local art still a gem of meremacwent to fermentaria for lunch with three friends probably would have been better if we drink beer but none of us do two of us had mushroom tacos which were tasty but not much there for the price the peas  carrots salad was okay but really overpriced at 12 the person having the fish tacos asked for the chipotle mayo on the side only to be informed that the chef will agree to leave out an ingredient when possible but will not allow anything to be put on the side so she got a seinfeldian no chipotle mayo for you maybe we could understand if this was a gourmet chef in some very exclusive restaurant but  seriously the customer cant decide how much or how little chipotle mayo to use bad business in my opinion the chef needs to chill and show some flexibility ps my friend didnt like the fish taco dish at all and only ate a small portion of it the menu is very limited and prices rather high for small plates plus side our waiter darren was terrificdisclaimer  my wife is a head chef so im kind of spoiled on really good food so i have high expectations  wife and i went to lc for an early dinner last saturday i had bought the 20 for 10 deal so when we got there and the waitress offered to make us margharitas i was all for driving two blocks and picking up a midlevel bottle after we ordered the apps   the mango margaritas were very tasty out came our empanadas and mole i was surprised how small the empanadas were and there were only two 2 my wife and i both come from the food business and we have run restaurants and cafeterias we know it costs about 2535 cents to make the empanadas and mole and they were charging 750 for each dish the food was good i must say but it did not knock our socks off   the pulled pork did not have enough mexican spices in it it kind of reminded us of bbq pulled pork the seafood enchiladas were good but for 18 bucks they brought me out a side of hot sauce complimented the food well  when we got the bill i notices they had charged us 700 for the margarita mix and 100 for the small side of hot sauce i felt like i was being nickel and dimed and the prices were a little steep i would like to try out other mexican restaurants in area and then compare them to lc but for now only two stars for this one despite everything it was a pleasurable experience i think it helped that we had just come from philly brew co and drank beer for an few hours beforehandi realize this is a new restaurant but they really need to get their act together  the interior is bright and well finished and the staff was very nice but did not know the menu very well  we ordered at the counter and the food is brought to your table  although it was not very busy at all the food took a long time to arrive  an order of scrambled eggs was supposed to be two eggs and arrived with only one on the plate the biscuits were cold and the housemade jam  listed on the menu as a part of the plate did not come with our food  it was delivered when we asked about preserves for the biscuits and  came to the table on a coffee saucer not a serving plate  not a huge dealbut not the expectation of a nice new restaurant  after we had received out food a second order with the same order  was brought around the restaurant  not a big deal except for the fact that the second order clearly had more scrambled eggsand more full plates and included jamthey ended up sending those breakfasts back to the kitchen  our food while okay was not very warm either  the coffee was excellent and was piping hot   additionally we were overcharged for our orders as the prices were incorrect in the computer  the staff quickly corrected the overcharge but we wondered why after a month in business the prices were not correct  we should have commented to someone but no one asked  how was your meal today so we just really wanted to eat and leave  would we come back  maybe if there is more attention paid to detail and food arrived in a timely manner  the quality of the food was good but got lost in the lackluster presentationit was our first time eating there and we all ordered mild the food was so spicy and hot that we couldnt finish most of the dishes if this was mild i would hate to taste hot all we tasted was hot not flavor in addition one of our party ordered the duck which wasnt ready when the other dishes were after asking three times when it would be done we canceled that part of the order and then they brought it out anyway if they had told us that the duck would take a half an hour longer than the other dishes it wouldnt have been ordered service was fineand the duck was taken off the billdelicious product and all but  i went in for my free birthday bundlet  i shouldnt have  i mean its not helping my diet or anything  i asked for the gluten free chocolate chip cake because i thought maybe thats healthier or something  what do i know  well i do know something  they asked me to pay 51 cents because the gluten free cakes are more expensive  i gave her the money and then said wait what  i thought it was free  shes all well its a little more expensive to make  were just trying to cover our costs  is that ok  i said no  its not ok  the email didnt say you can have anything but the gluten free or that the gluten free would cost 51 cents  it just said free  is paying 51 cents free  she said well no  its not  i think i said something about how its not even truly gluten free because of crosscontamination and using the same equipment to make everything  she then said would you like your money back  i said yes i would  now i also could have asked for a receipt and probably taken them to small claims court for false advertising  if you think im being cheap ask yourself how cheap it is for them to advertise free and then ask for money  now a lawyer most likely wont touch a minor lawsuit but its important for them to follow the law  false advertising is false advertising whether the amount is 51 cents of 51 million cents  i didnt enjoy my cake nearly as much as i would have if it werent for this  i know most people would just go along with it and have a little bad feeling and go its just 51 cents why argue  i guess i think its just 51 cents how dare they aski had been to mad mex for drinks and apps in the past and had a fairly decent experience but the food i ordered tonight for dinner was straight nasty  i ordered a salad that arrived and was missing half of the ingredients it claimed to come with on the menu  on top of that the salad came with bean sprouts which i guess were not washed because every time i bit into my salad it felt like i was chewing on dirtsand after discovering that my salad had dirt in it i really couldnt keep eating it i feel like washing lettucegreens is something all restaurants should have down especially for almost 14salad  disappointing and i will probably not be back anytime soonwe used to get pizza from her every couple of months it was decent and we liked the flavored crust options however after our last visit we will not return i ordered a pizza for pick up picked it up and went in to work this is a job where my kids come with me after my kids took their first bite they were complaining of the pizza being too spicy the crust was red which was really weird because i ordered the garlic crust so i called to tell them that we didnt get what we ordered the guy seemed to remember my pizza and said it was their sriracha crust they offered to make me another pizza but i was at work and couldnt leave to go get it the guy told me not to order that pizza if it was too hot for my kids and i explained to him i didnt order it and they messed up after talking to the manager they said there was nothing they could do really you guys didnt give me what i ordered we wont return here for pizza againthis is my third visit to maynards this is my first review of it  my first visit was good my second visit was fair this last time was terrible  we arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 20 minutes to be seated  service was very slow and lousy  martini was a half filled glass  bread came after our salads   the porkchop  was fatty and small  my daughter had the duck   it was bloody rare and had to be sent back  management did not even follow up on the problem    overall a terrible experience  i am done with this placethe food wasnt hot overcooked and not the way we ordered it the waitress was not the best and seemed not to care about the problems we encountered  the check was brought and we werent asked about coffee or dessert  not that we would order it after all the problems we had  none of us 7 enjoyed the meals  the best part were the two appetizers we had the third appetizer was almost cold we dont plan to hurry backwifi is terrible coffee is average we got the vegan wrap and it was really dry and bland so sad because it looked good but just no flavor and not nearly enough sauce the texture was hard to swallow because of how dry it wasthis review is for the pub not the beer but after probably the fifth or so time ive been to 4 hands i think im done   the time before i stopped in to see about a growler fill i was told that none of the specialty beers which are few were available for growler fills even for my halfgrowler i dont really understand this policy  i mean what is the difference between buying two pints at the bar  buying two pints togo its not like im trying to horde their rare stuff or buy high gravity beer in mass quantities but nothing  even the stuff i can buy in a 22 oz at schnucks  was available for growler other than the stuff easily found outside the brewery   which is not to say anything negative about their stuff in cans im always pleased to see it at music venues and restaurants i love contact high alter ego is nice and the usual suspects  single speed divided sky etc  are solid reliably good beers   but i just dont see much point in visiting the brewery theres rarely anything special or unavailable elsewhere this time they were out of the cuvee diable which left the one hitter quitter malt liquor nope and vigilante nice as the only rare finds in the place compare this with schlafly and urban chestnut and perennial all of which offer plenty of treasures to entice visitors i had the passion fruit prussia which i loved but like everything else it can be found outside the brewery and none of it can be purchased for a growler it doesnt seem like an intentional destination brewery but an afterthought that they might as well sell the stuff on tap that they work so hard to package  retail   and finally the music sucks big time somebodyies with an attention deficit issue was shopping around satellite radio for anything under the sun from dr dog to bill withers to kool  the gang and they switched off in the middle of the commodores for the same damn dr dog song a second time boooo just another suggestion that the brewpub effort lacks intention the focus is on the retail it was the last straw to convince me that i dont need to hang here anymorefood is the same as that from any other panera  service is just not that friendly though pardonnez moi for asking for freezer bags for my bagels does it really cause you to have to exert that much more effortall i have to say is the chipotle staff is ridiculous they are beyond stingy with the ingredients dont put too much we may have to restock the burrito bar and then we would actually have to work seriously they lined the bottom of my husbands taco perfectly a straight one level line of steak in a rather large crispy shell dont go to over board with the meat after all whats a taco with more than 6 tiny cubed pieces of steak i have given up on this location time after time of staff being so lazy about the amount they put in a taco or in a bowl i dont feel i should have to ask for more or pay for double meat when the double meat portion is what should actually be in my order ever other location i have visited knows how to make a proper burrito or taco this location is just simply lazy save your money and go to qdobas they are not chincy with their meateh thats how i felt about the food not delicious but not terrible the portions are huge so you get what you pay for the rice and salad were tasty but my chicken and potatoes shared the same seasoning and they were both over seasoned the pita bread came out of a plastic bag so you had some grocery store pita on your plate eh  still in the hunt for some good greekdrove from florida to see it because saw it on food network the kale salad was the feature and we asked for it for the first time ever they said they were out of there famous kale salad other food was decent but very disappointedi had such high expectations  ive been to the chocolate bar and roosters and both of those were outstanding but baileys range was  eh  i ordered the american burger and it was just okay  i thought the mac and cheese patty would make the burger but it really didnt add much to it at all  on top of that i was not a fan of any of their homemade sauces i tried  i wish i would have liked it better  on the plus side they have a fantastic selection of beerprobably the worst wawa in the tristate region they are always out of stuff and the stuff they do have is not of the wawa quality that i come to love from wawa also there are always food crates on the floor which i think is a a health violation the only good thing about them is their bathrooms are clean but the management seems to think the best time to clean them are during the busiest time of the daynightfor the 3rd time ive ordered my favorite meal from this taco bell and they just cant pull of the correct ingredients with their equipment i get a 6 which is 2 chalupas hard taco and a drink i always get chicken no tomatoes add nacho cheese hard taco and mtn dew baja blast with hot sauce tonight i got beef chalupas tomatoes onions dont come with it in the first place a soft taco an ice tea of all things and surprisingly hot sauce and the fact that chicken and nacho cheese cost 250 more is not why im mad all 3 times there was nobody in line and not even inside so from now on im going to the one and keystone and 62st street sure im going to wait in like for 20 minuets but at least i know my order will be correct even when its a cluster at 1am with all the drunks id rather deal with that than a terribly inaccurate order of castleton tbellwe walked in and several tables were dirty not to mention it felt rather humid inside i mean i get its a tropical place but i dont want to feel the humidity lol i order and found that they were widely backed up with the orders i dont know if the were understaffed or just busy it was rough its an open kitchen so i could see cooks standing around  the drink area and sauces bar were a mess obviously because they were busy after waiting 15 minutes they started on my order  i got my order 23 minutes after ordering it  this place needs some help a for effortthis store disappoints on so many levels bad customer service prefrozen seafood prefrozen chicken is it so hard to put out fresh product with a smileive been here three or four times and have had very different experiences depending on who is working  overall though i dont think ill be back    there are a lot of nice things about this place  theres plenty of comfy seating and the menu is actually pretty diverse for a place that focuses on wine first and food second  ive had the cheese plate a couple of apps and sandwiches on various trips and each time the meals have been solid   on the other hand theres a lot about this place that rubs me the wrong way picking a midpriced bottle of wine can be tricky for the nonexpert  the last time i went i chose a bottle and the waitress said we dont have that one  they had to rebottle it or something because it was messed up  ill give you a couple of minutes to find something else  maybe im overly fussy but i thought it was weak she didnt suggest something similar off the menu to try  i always feel a little adrift when picking from a wine menu and the help of an expert can go a long way in making me feel comfortable    at 1040 i checked someone who was not our waitress manager or owner i think brought over our check and said we close at 11  okay fine  sort of tacky but the dude has places to be i guess  so we sat there and finished our wine and chatted and at 1050 i checked again the guy is flipping off some of the rows of lights and sweeping etc basically letting us know we needed to get the hell out of there   now i get that you want to get home and its annoying when youve just got one table between you and freedom but were paying customers and it you close at 11 shoo us out at 11 if you have to  i work in a job where if somebody shows up at 8 and we close at 8 i put on my biggest smile and invite them into the store and try to make some money    lastly i thought it was lame the owner had a boohoo note scotchtaped inside all of the menus about how he had to charge 1 extra for anyone to use a credit card because the evil cc companies were charging him too much  if you need to make more money train your servers to suggest specials or dessert or gasp wine  there are a million ways to make an extra buck per customer that dont involve a gauche note in the menu    my verdict  good food good wine selection but at times very shaky service and management  ill spend my leisure dollars elsewheredont get the noodle bowl it was excessively salty and almost half onions also wasnt even in a bowl sad also the jerk chicken sandwich was more of a ginger sandwich overall lunch was mehwe are all familiar with mcdonalds its menu and what it consist of so ill skip through that all the only area i feel left to critique is its service and staff  well me being a local ive gone a number of times and the service is very inconsistent often forgetting cheese sauce etc again its mcdonalds and its a part of who we are so ill continue to go back but is it just me who believes the constant forgetfulness of condiments is only a way for them to cash in  next time forget to give me an extra burger or order of friesim not sure what is made to order or premade or made in house they were unable to make anything for me that was slightly altered for allergies almost any italian restaurant i have been too is able to make the sauce without an ingredient for me the inside atmosphere is pleasantbland everything was bland i have eaten there twice and both times was disappointed even their beer is bland  tried one of their pale ales and the flavor was shallow and fake they were out of the local brew i originally ordered lettuce wraps lacked flavor with slimy chicken spicy peanut chicken noodles had no flavor boring food boring atmosphere just boring wont be backi used to eat at the old cairdeas  and then i stopped because of time it took to prepare the food  when i needed a coffee or a chai tea i left in a good mood  but when i went for a meal i always became irritated  im all about fresh food made to order dont get me wrong  but when my waits extended past 20 minutes i began seeking another coffee joint with veggie wraps and wifi  once i took a friend and we sat outside and chatted for over half an hour and i finally couldnt stand it  i asked the people behind the counter about the order and it had been forgotten  the sad thing was i assumed they were still making it due to my previous experiences  i never even considered eating at the new one until recently  i figured it had been quite some time and perhaps things had changed  the entire experience was amazing  except the wait for the food  the girl at the counter couldnt have been friendlier the menu was great my chai tea was as good as it gets i loved the new decor  we went after lunch so there was only one other person sitting in the cafe side and there didnt seem to be much activity in the dining area  my friend and i chatted then i pulled out my laptop to quickly check email then i showed my dining companion some pictures then i put my laptop away  after awhile he asked if he could use my laptop to pay some bills  after the bill paying was complete we asked about our food and the obliging girl said she would check on it  after another wait although a small wait this time two veggie wraps arrivedplace was awesome the one time i sat at the bar this time i sat at a table and sat and sat some more 15 minutes total the whole time i saw the bar tender saving a spot for his buddies who pulled up and got immediate service ended up walking out and re locating 5 minutes before the lightning game started if the bar is packed walk outi love hw but this was my first time at this location and beyond disappointed i usually go here due to the quality of the produce however this location was terrible there is fresher produce at walmart  wont be backthose who give cafe bamboo 5 stars are simply hard up for a vegetarian restaurant in new orleans  i feel your pain but cannot in good faith give this place 5 stars  went for dinner on a wednesday evening and sat outside in the courtyard  service was unbelievably slow in spite of there being two or more waiters and less than 8 tables  drinks were almost never refilled as we waited at least 45 mins for our entrees to arrive  when they did arrive they were generally mediocre  this place relies heavily upon meat substitutes which to me signals a lack of creativity in the kitchen  flavors were not great presentation was hohum  looking forward to the opening of the green goddess so cafe bamboo doesnt have to bear the weight of being nolas only veggie restaurant because obviously they cant handle itsummary unfriendly serverhost frozen vegetables used and subpar tikki masala sauce naan was excellent  host was very awkward unfriendly seemed  miserableborderline angry and stared through my soul like the grim reaper seems like kids were running the placehorrible first impression   two diners we ordered tikki masala and vegetable korma tikki sauce was too thick sweet and tasted like it was store bought 6 chunks of chicken for 15 rice wasnt flavorful at all tasted like long grain white rice  vegetable korma tasted like frozen vegetables that had been reheated naan was excellentonly reason im giving 2 stars maybe lunch buffet is betteri would definitely have to agree with byron j on this one we seem to frequent many of the same locations  i live about 2 miles from five guys and i rarely crave red meat but when i do i make an effort to have a burgerwhen five guys got to town my hubby and i were very excited to give it a go  weve tried it on several occasions  first of all i know they make everything to order but they are slow  this is kind of annoying when i just want to grab and gosecond it is underwhelmingly decent but not a fantastic burger    when a place specializes in one thing i think it should be done perfect every time no exception  the one thing i do like about the burgers is the bacon  they do the bacon awesome  everything else is just average which is fairly disappointing considering its all they do  i also think its ironic that they boast about how fabulous they are on every wall too bad none of those are local  maybe ill check out a five guys in another city but i would recommend hardees over this joint and they are a lot fasterwent back a second time just because its in a great location and i really wanted to like this place my noodle was under cooked and the pork had way too much fat i am done with this place kin and nomiya are my places for ramenthe local tacos menu is exciting  so many varieties of individual tacos for a great price 250 for most tacos  even the special of the day the lobster enchilada was quite reasonably priced  20 goes a loooonnnggggg way at the local taco  alas there was a big thing i found to be lacking at the local taco  salt  every single thing i ate from each taco  i tried the vegetarian buttermilk fried chicken the buffalo and korean bbq  to the lobster enchilada to the jalapeo coleslaw lacked a punch of flavor  how could this be  were talking ingredients like melted cheese even tangy buffalo sauce which was a little on the sweet side and jalapeo and i felt like something really lacked in the flavor of every item i had  except for the fried green chili mac n cheese and the korean bulgogi meet stood up flavorwise   its more than affordable and everything was ready super fast  big pluses  however  mas tacos por favor1 burger for pickup guy said itd be 20 mins 35 mins later i got my food  bacon was grossas a frequent  customer i expected better the employees didnt smile or engage customers not even when ordering the tray the food was served on was extremely filthywhen i ordered my dessert it looked nothing like the picture very disappointed  many many employees walking aroundcame here because a dear friend gave me a gift card  im sorry to say that allegro il gelato has completely spoiled my tastebuds completely obviously frost has struck a chord here in tucson with all of its fans giving high reviews here and its many franchised stores me thinks that many if most have not tried allegros  ok i start sampling flavors i think im going to try as many incommon flavors as allegros for a fun comparison start with one of my perennial favoritessalted caramel yuck tastes artificial ok cinnamon next nope the same this is not good two of what should be home run flavors foul out maybe a fruit flavor will be better strawberry ugh tastes like grocery strawberries coming from ca thats not a compliment how does ivan at allegro gelato get his to taste so much like fresh ca freshberries only three flavors and already my mouth is frosted  my wife tried peanut butter crunch pumpkin and cinnamon she said they all kind of tasted the same she loves anything peanut butter she passes  she ends up with cookies and cream its ok in desperation i try chocolate acceptable  after experiencing allegro gelato it was disconcerting to watch them just slap the gelato in the cup almost unappetizing im thinking youre not slinging mortar to lay bricks isnt your product better than that  i liked the flakes of chocolate in my flavor it gave it a little nice texture to it but lets compare other qualities the texture of frost in this chocolate was not bad the texture in the other flavors were more airy than at allegro one thing that struck me was that with allegros gelato there is a wonderful after taste that lingers on the taste buds like a romantic memory on my palate twas not so with frost the flavor was only present when it was in my mouth  like allegro frost has a round cookie see photos they put in the cup of gelato it is a cheaper cookie than the hazelnut cream filled pirouettes you get at allegro i mean its a good cookie but im comparing here and it is not of the quality at allegro  the spoons ah here is where they outshine allegro they are multicolored mini spadelike paddle things and bigger than what allegro uses they are kind of cool  prices are comparable with allegro service is really good my server always called me sir many employees on a friday night made for fast service  so bottom line is frost is ok at least the chocolate the rest tastes like medicine to me will you frost fans who obviously have fallen in love with gelato go give ivans gelato a try hes not only italian like the owners of frost i understand but he got his degree in italy at the gelato university in bologna  two or three starsohi dont knowmeh ive experienced betteryeah i guess soi love wings but this isnt my thing after visiting past two years   others were enjoying so i suggest giving it a try    the downtown casinos host this event with virginia street closed   vendors are on both sides with lines to the booths blocking where people walk  too much in a very tight corridor     the vendors are your typical craft fair circuit folks  always the one booth selling tasers next to the spice booth  cigarette smoke competed with bbq smoke   bring a lot of cash as you will spend around 2 for a winglittle cheaper by the dozen  the vip tent is nicely set up where you can actually sample all the vendors wings under one tent instead of standing in a long line making room for strollers and smokersbut it will cost you 75    this event would be ideal in a spacious regional park  bring the price down make more room to eat your costly samples and offer an affordable option to sample all the vendors in one line  i would gladly spend 20 for a dozen wings from a dozen different vendors on one plate  the country music live band was nice but the experience is quickly ruined by cigarette smoke and homeless meth head looking people dancing   i think this event has a lot of potential if its not in downtown reno under the casinos shadowthe pizza lacks go to eddie  sams a couple of minutes away you wont regret it the pizza tastes not great mostly because of the cheese not sure how they cook it to come out almost fried on the pizza it crumbles almost i make the trip to downtown for eddies even though this precinct is closer the service was not good also i regret to say its better to try something elsethe service is atrocious the chicago style pizza is mediocre  the ambiance is suitable for folks who incessantly use instagram  lots of old advertisements toys and trinkets to give you the false impression that the place is hip and worthy of your cash yes cash they dont accept credit cards so enjoy hitting the bank up on the way or giving a charitable contribution in the form of an atm feeservice was great food was the downfall here my fries had obviously been sitting around for awhile my nuggets were mushy so im assuming they were too the stars are for the servicei went to dinardos because i love seafood and ready many reviews that this was one of the best seafood restaurants in philly well i disagree we went for blue crabs but they ran out 9 days ago okay it happens we ordered the crab soup it tasted like canned vegetable soup we ordered a pound of overpriced snow crab legs nothing to jump for joy about we paid extra for garlic butter and that was the saving grace we also ordered the broiled seafood platter where you got the smallest sea scallops a soggy piece of farm raised tilapia 6 jumbo shrimp a half pound of snow crabs and a silver dollar sized crab cake the crab cake was the standout on the dish i opted to take the fish home and finish cooking it   we also ordered cocktails they were just okay the ambiance was dated and could use new or cleaned carpets we tried it likely will not be back next stop devonstried to sit outside but the speakers are blown and blasting static i spent 18 on a   spider roll and an eel avocado roll the spider roll came with miso soup and salad lots of food but none of it that goodfood is pretty good but yet i still only give this place 2 stars service is below average and prices are high if you charge prices thid high you better deliver and they fell shortthe play area is quite good and big they have a few pretty impressive play structures so lots for the kids to do i had the banana bread and breakfast sandwich the food is much to write home about the banana bread taste like its probably store bought and the breakfast sandwich resembles the precooked variety they are not unreasonable for the price my biggest dislike about this cafe however is the fact that all of their utensils cups and plates are disposable for that reason alone i probably wont come backthis review is strictly for the togo boba drinks  we were in the same plaza for dinner and while we were waiting for our food to arrive i did a little search on yelp  this place came up and i mentioned to my party that this place serves boba and my party insisted to get a few drinks from here after dinner  i walked inside after dinner and noticed that this place was packed  when i walked inside i saw that they had a separate section for drink orders so i proceeded to that station  the guy who was standing at the drinks section pretty much gave me a look and ignored me  another guy showed up and asked me what i wanted  i told him that i wanted to order 2 drinks  he told me to wait a minute and came back to help me out a few minutes later  i ordered a large thai tea with boba and jasmine milk tea cant remember  a few minutes later our drinks were ready  i immediately grabbed our drinks and left  when i finally had the chance to try the thai tea with boba i thought it was just mediocre  it didnt have the thai tea flavor that im used to getting even at thai restaurants and the boba was too soft   no comment on the jasmine milk tea since i didnt get to try ityoud think for a place called brodo that youd be able to get a decent cup of soup  well youd be wrong  i stopped in today after trying to get into nom nom which was mobbed and they dont offer take out  wth  but thats another review  brodo looks very sleek new and nice  prices seem low enough  but it ends there i got a 12 sandwich veggie and a cup of soup their version of italian wedding  i asked if i could substitute cheddar for the american cheese which is a waste of tasteless fatcalories and was told they only have shredded cheddar  but i could get swiss or provolone  so i opted for no cheese  meanhwile i start to eat it back at the office and there is a weird horseradish taste to the mayo  i think they goofed and put horseradish mayo on it  weird  but not bad  the soup was saltladen and not even close to being delicious  not goin back sorry  i spent 840 for the combo no drink oh and the line waas not bad when i went  but if there is a long line dont wait in it  not worth it  so sad because it looks very nice  i sure do miss the naked chocolate cafe thoughmade the drive here and attempted to go to lunch  never happened  the parking situation is horrible  80 of the parking spots are marked as compact and are very very narrow like smart car size  smaller than normal compact size   circled the parking lot 5 times and it was chaos before leaving  4r needs to work out an over flow maybe with the funeral home next doori went to las cazuelas for the first time last week and the best part about the experience was the tequillaand we brought that with us  from start to finish this place was a disappointment  the place was completely empty when we arrived and we still had a long waits for service  this is a byo so we brought tequilla with us but expected they would make our margaritas   instead they brought the maragarita mix to the table and told us to pour the tequilla in our glasses and then add the mix  admittedly this did allow for stronger drinks which were needed by the time our appetizers came out  all of the food we ordered seemed extremely greasy especially the queso which basically solidified before it got to our table  i have been to some really good mexican places in the city but this clearly is not one of themmy sisters and i went for lunch the place was busy of course which that wouldnt be a surprise the main entrance greeters hostess were nice we were seated at the top it took a moment for our waiter to come when he did he seemed nice we waited for our drinks and appetizers for awhile the only thing that came was the chicken jalepeno wings they  ouldbt eat yet because there were no plates or napkins  i had to flag down any waiter i saw because i dont know where ours went the other waiter brought it they began to eat mind you still waiting for our drinks and my loaded fries nothing i had to flag down our waiter to ask what was going on with the delay he apologized  and said hell be back thats fine well at this point he comes with all our foods and drinks at the same time defeated the point of appetizers but anywayswe are eating and i noticed no fries for none of our sandwiches had to flag down another waiter to please go get our waiter by this point we were getting upset  he came back with the fries bit we were almost done with our burgers i then wanted another drink peach lemonade he took so long to come back when did he came back with something  else so i had him take that back by now we wanted to leave because honestly the service was poor  i then had to flag the hostess down to get our waiter she did we asked a box he came back with the smallest box ever so we had to stuff the fries and my sisters wings in this little box i can say that he did come fast with the check though and to pick it back really quickly they didnt want me to leave him a tip but i still did anyways i dont think we will come back her again 1st impression is always keyhopefully they will find their way but this promising new breakfastlunch joint is a disaster after waiting well over an hour for a table our waitress forgot our drinks and the food that came out was not what we ordered the avocado toast was tasteless and not up to speed while the rest of the food was on par with a greasy spoon joint and not the modern fresh atmosphere suggested i suggest we all give them time to find their legs train their staff and improve the quality of the potentially appealing menuwhy does this marsh not carry loose mushrooms like every other marketplace this marsh is always dark tooim seriously picky about my breakfast  maybe because its my favorite meal of the day but its really hard for me to find an amazing breakfast and cafe deluxe didnt fit the bill either our waitress was a little cold to us when we came in but when a friend mentioned something about it she was apologetic   we ordered coffee and orange juice but only the coffee made it out to us so we reordered the orange juice and waited again the orange juice tastes right out of a bottle really not worth it at all  i decided on the deluxe scramble with broccoli mushrooms and chicken sausage its a pretty big plate but overall just disappointing i think the broccoli is actually broccoli rabe much more bitter than i expected and it really detracted from everything else it was also more stem than florets the chicken sausage was pretty sparse theres just really nothing special going on here  maybe breakfast isnt their strong suit so id be willing to come back and give lunch a try their salads and sandwiches sound great maybe ill be able to bump them up a star or moreim super disappointed with this place now i went tonight for the first time since the new owners took over there is zero ambience and it honestly feels cold the white table linens do nothing to warm up the space and the sitting area with the couch is gone the patios may be ok still but i just feel like the overall vibe was sucky the wine selection is much smaller and i was super underwhelmed with the menu its in my neighborhood but i think ill just drive to sashas for the experience im looking forplace still doesnt seem to have improved constantly low on all items to where if the 2 people in front of you happen to want the same thing you want then you have to wait for them to make more come in too early or too late they have even fewer items and dont have the lights on most recently i could tell the teriyaki chicken they were cutting for me was very pink and she still put it in the box they seem to rarely ever have more than 1 person working the food and sometimes the same person is running back and forth between the food and ringing you up i would stick to the higher volume mall locationspayette used to be my favorite brewery in the treasure valley ever since the move to the new location the service of the wait staff is abhorrent weekly my buddy and i meet up for a few pints and are disgusted by the snarky impatient attitude of the servers behind the bar if you arent sure of what youd like to enjoy as there are so many awesome choices these guys get short and give you the eye roll asking about the future of the old tasting room we were ridiculed by the server for paying it compliments in favor of the new locale for its quaintness mike francis sort out your bar staff they are consistently alienating patrons and forgetting they work in a service industry i dont want to be relegated to just enjoying payette beer from the local grocery outlets but the new staff is a downerthe price does not reflect the quality of service or food overall poor value unless youre 6575 and have that passive income locked down then you probably dont carefood was good but everything else was a joke management and staff decided to have a party off to the side of the restaurant literally 15 people standing around talking and gossiping management servers and kitchen staff included not only was it distracting the service was terrible good food is only half of the equation and the fact that the management team didnt seem concerned that our bill got lost and just shrugged and walked back over to the party was the cherry on topthis place is a joke yet is always doing business go figure  the place is just  full of the meatheaded idiots that i normally cant stand to be around plus its always loud due to some moron playing some horrible music over the jukebox   the only redeeming quality about this place is the fact that there are some good pool tables and quite a few televisions for watching sports and whatnot   when i do find myself at bars its never at this placeportions are extremely small  containers are teeny as well making it difficult to eat im at a poke place in california right now where i know its common and i cant believe the difference in portions  the pricing is way cheaper here too for better size and quality i really hope poke bowl makes some changes because im a huge fan of poke and there arent any other places in phillyportion sizes are kinda disappointing for the price many of the rice dishes are basically just some pan fried chicken breast smothered in sauce and served with plain white rice the general tsos and teriyaki are decent but i find that the meat is often dry and rubbery not really impressive but if you need a quick fix of cheap and spicy americanized asian food the 5 general tsos is hard to beat for value the salads also offer pretty good variety but i wish the ahi tuna salads had large chunks of fish rather than the kindof ground up raw tuna that they last served it withi have no idea why this place gets high ratings  its a food van thats permanently parked by a tent at the intersection of a road  positives  they had a wounded warrior sticker on their window  negatives  parking is terrible but you can find a space even when its a busy weekend night just dont expect to park in a straight line  i had the hard taco and a burrito asada  they have the sonoran hot dogs ive never had one  compared to california it is completely average and i dont have a high opinion of california  its also a long wait not just to order but after you order which i wouldnt have a problem with if it tasted goodmy wife loves these place i could live with out it last time i was here a guy who handed me my gelato  said chow i dont know what he meant but i know what that means i think these place is a scam like pink berry  but of course women love these place i think is because they think its less fat then real ice cream  maybe it is  but to me its like the people that drink diet soda or light beer  its all sugar  if it wasnt then why not post the nutritionalif any value on you r websitefirst i want to say that ive downgraded my review after having contacted the email address on the website and waiting a week no reply no acknowledgement at all  because i was hosting family from out of town two weekends ago the tuesday before our family event i reserved a table for 11 people on saturday night via yelp we planned our day around this knowing wed need to be in no libs by 7  i received a phone call to confirm at 1230 as well as a text message and an email three confirmations when i called around 3 to add one more person i was told that it wouldnt be a problem but they appreciated the call lo an behold after the 12 of us piled into ubers and arrived laden with a few sixpacks and a bottle of tequila we were told there was no reservation it must have been lost we spoke to a woman who identified herself as the manager and with a shrug and an apology she turned us away  i couldnt believe this first of all we had planned our day around this and spent money and time on transportation to get to our reservation that had been thrice confirmed secondly i was extremely embarrassed to tell my family that the nice dinner we were looking forward to and that i had planned had been cancelled without our knowing it finally to be turned away without any sort of compensation a coupon off a future visit anything to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience was unacceptable  i am surprised and disappointed by this as i mentioned in my previous review i had always had a great experience at this restaurant at this point i have no plans to return and i certainly will never make a reservation for a large group againthe good  service is fantastic friendly competent fast  view from the outside tables is wonderful  inside tables are fun  clam chowder was pretty good  the bad  the rest of the food was downright bad  prices are really high theyd be fine if the food was good  we left both hungry and feeling taken  when we visit sb in the future well find somewhere else to eatgood food very disappointing customer service hired them for a corporate catering order for a large party that was several hundred dollars delivery contact was 45 minutes late with no apology upon receiving my receipt from a member of the staff i replied politely with my concerns and never received a reply will not be ordering catering from here againi think the space is cute and ive been to the location in soho  now im strictly an espresso drinker and wellthe espresso just wasnt very good  maybe it was an off saturday  i dunno  but it tasted burnt  like borderline starbucks quality  thats not very goodfrom the stale bread and burnt breadsticks in the bread basket to the lackluster cioppino to the burnt tasting  roomtemperatureobviouslynotdecaforwhyamistillawakeat330amcoffee to the server who spent more time checking out his tips from other tables and obviously trying to upsell and pander for a bigger tip than providing actual service to the loud interior to the mousse that was so thick and heavy that it was practically pudding this restaurant only earned a couple of stars for two reasons the cioppino had very good seafood scallops and the tiramisu was light delicate and the perfect amount of sweetness  however the flavor of the cioppino at brophy brothers is far superior dont waste your time here  dinner took 2  12 hours or your money if youre in the mood for italian go to olio e limone or ca dariowe enjoy blimpie and dont mind the walkin experience at this location but the drivethru is awful they had to ask us for our order three times and it took over 20 minutes to leave with our order which they still messed up this isnt the first time we have had experiences with a super slow drivethru here dont risk it if you are in a rushit is a bad taco bell poorly made food luckily i live close so i eat it when i get back but for those who eat and drive never go here its also not that great tasting2016 event less than 10 chicken wing vendors to sample from the gun shooting and the yellow tape pretty much dampered the mood so part of it was closed off i go to this wing fest every year but this year was a dissppointment wasnt bad but it wasnt great ive gone to this starbucks two days in row and the service was terribly slow ive never had to wait 10 minutes plus for a black tealemonade it was 9am and not too busy not sure if i hit two days in a row where they were training but it was snails pace slowterrible bar service and attitude in the upstairs bar on sunday evening  server was great and food ok but bar tender no thanksthe was a reason why this bk was practically empty when i stopped in for a quick breakfast the other day    the biscuit for my sandwich was hard and too small to enclose its contents  it appeared to be a tube biscuit that had been made earlier and left in the open air to dry out and then microwaved just before sale  it rehardened quickly and was a crumbly mess to eat  just not very good despite the fact that the rest of the ingredients seemed fresh    given the competition across the street it is difficult to see how this place survives maybe their burgers are better but i wont be back to find outi eat alone all the time and here it was just like way to make me feel awkward they even wanted my extra chair instead of taking one from another table that was empty but whatever i was nearly done at that point like considering every server had on a lightning shirt and i was wearing a shirt for the evil opponent it makes me wonder if they were just being super lame but considering there were large groups of people clearly speaking french getting nice service i just dont get why they acted so weird towards me as one person  since i hadnt eaten all day i got a personal size 10 pizza with just jalapenos on it it was pretty good but meh i almost wish i just overpaid for something in the arena it would have been 3 stars if i hadnt been treated like a second rate customer for being one personothers say the food is good and the menu looks enticing but the espresso shot was sour and foam was poor  i mentioned info and hours on yelp were wrong  the new owner bought it in june and is still working on things   yeahok wasnt that 6 months ago  good to great is about the details  tamping steaming and setting proper expectations    being an independent restauranteur is difficult  boli really wanted to like this place super hip ambiance but poor execution with the food and subpar service pizza was undercooked not sure how you mess up pizza to be honestperhaps they were having an off night my friend said her cocktail was good so it wasnt a complete failure these elite members raving about this place are clearly sipping that koolaidgood beer selection usually but unfortunately they serve some of the more desirable beers in ridiculous goblets and dont switch when you request a pint also service is pretty poor sadfrom some of the reviews i had high hopes for this pizza but i guess tucson just doesnt know what good pizza is  we ordered the large veggie and it was undercooked over onioned and had almost no sauce or flavor for that matter  do yourself a favor and get some mexican food this town just doesnt do italianpicked this place after reading the reviews  the main restaurant is nothing special imo  the greek salad was pretty good but it was clearly the highlight of our meal  neat kitcshy atmosphere but they pack you in and the food is overpriced  the bakery attached is the only reason i would ever come here again so save yourself the overpriced meal and get dessert  my wife ordered a meal and pointed to it but got something else served to her  perhaps my rating is jaded by the atmosphere of area  people bugging you to take a boat ride visit their store etc  its not my scene and way too touristy  so i was looking for hellas to take me away from that and i feel like they tried to take advantage of us instead  i will not be returning unless im with a group that insists on going hereok i was willing to give it another chance i stopped by and i saw a better working team even the manager was focused and involved the place was much cleaner and spiffy i ordered the 8 piece bucket original recipe the worker pulled the pieces from what looked like freshly fried tray i am thinking yay now why is the mash the obligatory side to have i asked to swap for spears and was told it was extra i was like lets not spoil this good moment and i said ok no biggie got home and was ready for some good stuff so i thought so far so good until i took a bite did someone at kfc change the recipe i was looking for that original recipe bite and goodness what i got was so bland it is like no one seasoned the chicken well ill be a damn and the consistency was like boiled chicken refried and breaded quality control is clearly lacking here kudos for the team meh for the chicken publix fried chicken still the winnervery very very rude white older man behind the counter cannot rate food because i walked out without buying anything due to his betterthanthou attitudemy wife and i went here on our first date way back when so you would think we felt a kinship with this place but on the few times we have since been back it has never been more than soso we went on friday with our kids because it was st patricks day but the irish stew was way overpriced and indifferent and lukewarm plus my sons had almost no meat in it and had been slopped over the bowl into the plate with the soda bread the latter as well as now being soggy was almost nothing like real soda bread which for starters does not contain raisins the stout i ordered was flat and the waiter tried to tell me this was normal for english beer i am english originally so can say with authority that this is not true i ordered a replacement scotch beer that was spectacular and was not charged for the flat stout but still and my wife ordered salmon cakes that contained little salmon and did not taste home made in all got the definite impression they were phoning it in and we will not be backthis place just misses the mark their beer is not half bad but the atmosphere is awful leaves a lot to be desired on the new orleans brewery scene with so many options i wouldnt pick this place cold as hell and full of children fluorescent lights really kill the mood and theres no liquorlunch burger was just ok i made the mistake of having too many toppings i could barely taste the burger go for the 8 ounce instead of the 4 ounce burger service was mediocre fries were small and bits and pieces chipotle sauce was great nice decor basically an updated version of fuddruckers nofuddruckers had good burgershad cha cha chow at food truck friday in tower grove park this past friday and i must say i am not impressed  i ordered the lobster taco which came with cabbage slaw cilantro lemon dressing that just tasted like lemon and sour cream and 3 of the tiniest pieces of lobster i have ever been served no joke they were about the size of a small cocktail shrimp tail or tiny crawfish tail the taco was mostly cabbage and a fried flour tortilla which was actually the best part of the taco and to top it off it cost either 8 or 9 i cant remember which either way it was not memorable and was without a doubt the worst thing i had at food truck friday  i might try them again to see if anything else on the menu can redeem this place but on value alone it was extremely disappointing it took me about 2 bites to eat and the flavor was just ok the friends that were with me ordered the lobster taco also and we were all let downsoo my family came to eat here and they were going to order to go for me since i had sick kids in the room 20 minutes later i called my sister to say why so long she said she was waiting in the to go line for me and my family had just been seated so i left my kids with my husband and went downstairs took her place in the to go line 2 people were in front of me she went to sit down and eat   20 minutes later they were leaving and i still didnt place my to go order seemed like these waiters were making the togo register the last priority finally placed my order and waited another 15 minutes seen my food done and waiting to be put in a bag watched these waitresses dance laugh joke with each other still my order was ignored waiting to be bagged finally bagged they gave me extra fries oops on them   burger was over cooked on the edges but pink in the middle tasteless fries were okay we were starving so we killed it but this place needs to dance less and pay more attention to customersthis was one of our favorite pizza spots in tampa it was our go to however the service is absolutely terrible we were there last month and the server was so incredibly slow it took her over 15 minutes to get our drinks she only had 3 tables when i asked for our waters she replied oh ill get them im waiting on his beer what i couldnt believe she didnt just go grab the waters quickly she was way more concerned about bussing tables and doing her closing work cleaning the floor wiping counters what really upset me was the other server was running laps around her and saw us sitting without drinks yet never asked to help her or asked us what we needed we were going to complain but by the time we got our food we just wanted to eat and get out of there   last weekend we ordered delivery we were quoted 30 minutes our food didnt show up for 1 hour and 20 minutes when i called to check after 45 minutes the girl who answered the phone was so rude she said all i can tell you is it is the next order out excuse me i asked to speak with a manager and was told he wouldnt be back for 2 hours when the order finally showed up it was fresh so i didnt make a big deal but i was told the girl on the phone was new and very young and he wasnt even a driver theyre very short staffed as a customer that isnt my problem  i will say they did send a 10 off coupon with an apology note i appreciated that but we will probably never return to this establishment unless we order and pickup the kitchen staff is rockin they just need much better service staffi would give a better review because ive had this before but tonight i walked into stank ass attitudes from the employeesowners ice cream is good though loli mean i get ityoure on south street and prob see a ton of whackos but ummm helloooo customer service still needs to be given and dont look at me crazy when my fat ass wants a extra topping irked at the moment but just giving them the stank face back currentlyand not leaving lolapparently i seem to be missing something the positives to this place is that is is small and quaint a good place for a first date i guess when you are too nervous to think about the quality of your food its also on a trendy upandcoming block in west philly so that might add to the popularity the food was simply average the prices too high and service almost nonexistent i was very disappointed in this place and wont go back i went there for lunch and got to the point where i started to wonder if the waiter had forgotten about me and the other customers waiting the soup was too salty the dumplings too doughy and without enough stuff in them to give them flavor and the chicken basil was too dry the veggies just average since i mentioned the chicken basil i should add it wasnt even what i ordered i ordered the shrimp i didnt say anything because a i was really indifferent about which of the four veggie shrimp beef chicken i got and b i didnt want it to be a hassle and i certainly didnt want the wait to be even longer so i didnt say anything at the end the waiter realized he gave me the wrong dish and took 10 off the chicken price whatever had he appeared while i was eating to either refill my water or ask me how my lunch was i would have said something and added no biggie just dont charge me the higher shrimp price mistakes happen no problem  the prices are a few bucks higher than what they should be if this place was in some generic suburban strip mall i think most of the positive reviewers would trash this place but since it is in a hipster neighborhood people say its great sort of like the seinfeld episode where george convinces attractive models that he once dated a nowdeceased fellow model and thus gets in the club women looked at george and said well since he dated one of us he must be a stud same deal here put a place in a cool neighborhood and somehow people think the food tastes better  one last thing this place does not take credit cards be warned dont get how in 2014 restaurants dont take credit cardsfriends and i waited a month to finally get a reservation for a place so tiny that they should only do first come first serve seating there are maybe eleven tables each seating only four and two people to be completely let down by the food service and pretentious clientele   the overpriced food was definitely not worth all the accolades and the only thing that stood out was the panna cotta on the dessert menu   they apparently overbooked on the sunday five pm slot we reserved we were rushed through our meal resulting in disgruntled patrons who came for the next seating the waitstaff on hand chose a passive uncommunicative approach to resolving the conflict making for a very awkward and unnecessary experience   this is my first yelp review and i am putting in the actual effort to write one because this restaurant is lacking the professional and efficient management that they really need if they are going to continue to pass off cheap cuts of meat as four star quality   its needless to say that we wont be back for secondsvery disappointed  went here for breakfast and there was no line  we waited over 45 minutes for our food and mine came out cold  no apologies from any staff who were unfriendly when ordering  the pastries looked quite nice and were popular and they serve illy coffee which are redeeming factors  i would eat here again if i were just getting a muffinalthough the service was top notch and the chips and salsa were delicious the main course was a little underwhelming    in fact on the walk home i realized that although i havent grocery shopped in quite awhile i still could have prepared the same meal at home    that was depressing    it just seems like they are caught between being a snooty nolibs restaurant and a neighborhood mexican placei just paid 1250 for a caprese sandwich small soup and a wee bag of chips no drink are you serious not even a very large sandwich at that i have got this same thing multiple times and it seems like it started at around 10 bucks after tax and suddenly its just to nearly 13 dollars their pizza is alright to grab since i work across the street but never will i pay this much for an ok sandwich and soup again i also just worked out the math here sammich cost 799  1 for soup then assuming they charge for chips thats maybe another 1 so 999 how the hell did i pay 1250 twice in a row now last time they just gave me a drink cup to make it evenive had better theyre new so ill give them a pass this time bowl was poorly put together and the staff lack professionalism there should be some adult supervision and someone who can train them in customer servicestopped here for the first time last week and was not too impressed it was a fridaywasnt too busy yet our food took forever to come out i dont know if it was the kitchen or the waitress that was slow but the food came out cold didnt taste bad but definitely had better after we finished we had to wait another 15 minutes to get our check because our waitress was in the back of the restaurant stacking bottles aside from that i did enjoy their chips and salsa but that was probably the only good thing from my experiencei had a big problem with my dc finishing her food before mine arrived when i mentioned it to the cashier she told me that thats normal because the salads come from a different part of the kitcheni have to tell ya i was excited to get another food option near where i work on the northwestside i didnt wait long to head over to five guys especially after i heard how good it was supposed to be  it wasnt  talk about a lame menu burgers fries and i think a hot dog not much else i guess that wouldnt be bad if you were as decent as 96th street steakburger but this place is not 96th street not even close i even thought it smelled a bit rank when i visited not a good thing smelled like the bathroom was backed up or something which doesnt make for an appealing lunch break blah  a quick look just now at their web site confirms it for me even that needs help and  looks like you have five options around the city in case youre wanting to try for yourself maybe a different location will be bettertypical starbucks quality food ok prices but this particular time service was super slow we even had to remind them in the drivethrough of the cake forgive them thoughi had food there last week my pizza i had was delicious and ice cream was good cotton candy with mini marshmallows great atmosphere and location the manager was constantly yelling at employees which makes it an awkward experience since you can see everything going on it was kind of like gordon ramsey but way way worse because he was yelling for no reason the staff is young and maybe the manager takes advantage of this hopefully the owners do something about it because i can see the food failing if the staff is yelled at all the time i wouldnt bring my family back because its stressful hearing the barking from the manager when youre trying to enjoy a meallets be totally honest here this is drunk food that happens to be pizza happens to be hot and happens to be in the area your drinking we got something pizza something pepperoni something cheese whatever i dont even know what we paid i think it was a medium i got heartburn or maybe it was the vodka idk pretty bad when your buzzed and it still ranks 2 stars if your coming out of the vogue or any other establishment and you need pizza caveat emptorsorry but its just too damn hot in this place anytime ive gone there the side of the building is a garage door and its always up only 2 small ac wall units one aims at the band and the other one is at the cash register both at either end of the place so be prepared to sweat beer is 6 a pintnot cold enough and yes they have a bad aftertastegreat food but received poor service by our waitress erica  we sat outside and waited in gaps of 3040 mins before she came back  recommend the food first visit was poor in service  we tipped bus boy well because he checked to help a couple times and explained bbq saucesthe food always comes out fresh but expect to wait in the drivethru for at least 20 minutes  steak n shakes have always been notorious for long drivethru lines but this is a little excessivei love pancakes and i had heard that the pancake pantry was the it place for pancakes in nashville  far from it   its very a trendy vandy thing to do but we wont be back head to fido on the same block and you wont regret it and if youre ever in minneapolis go to the original pancake house for the best pancakes of your lifefirst off finding parking is a nightmare  second although the name is catchy and cute the building is cute and trendy the food and coffee are mediocre at best  we stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our anniversary weekend and were really disappointed  our breakfast sandwiches were very greasy and salty the coffee beverages were also very lacking  its so hard to find a good coffee shoppresentation was put over authenticity   quality was good but average at best taste  service was quite slow waited a solid 20 minutes for our waitress to greet us and waited another solid 20 minutes waiting for our check   this place is great if you dont really like mexican foodwe had the mussels and chicken sandwich and both tasted like nothing drinks were overpriced and not worth it either would not recommendwent there for the first time evereveryone brags about how amazing sprinkles cupcakes are so i had to have them to my disappointment i wasnt happyfirst the lady didnt put the cupcakes properly in the box and when i opened them soon as i walked out they were toppled over then i try pumpkin it had great icing but the cake part was dry  then im like let me give it another try  i tried the sprinkle one well to my disappointment the cake part taste like baking powder i must say on a positive note the store was so pretty and the presentation of the cupcake was so nice this place used to be the best everbut recently it is not the owner the fatherwas so friendly happy and just awesome love that guy but recently i have not seem him thereand now the food is horrible  went there over the weekend and the cook a young guy actually served me a hash brown that was so over cooked there was no potato left in it it was so greasy and just dry  what happened to manager  the father that worked here he needs to come backnot impressed  we ordered for delivery which was timely but the pie arrived cold the cheese had slid over to the side and the crust def was not as good as down the shore  the crust tasted like they had a hard time rolling it out and it was kind of rubbery it tasted like crackers or matzo or something it was very bland  with that said had the pizza been hot the sauce is pretty good and the toppings though there was barely any sausage at all on the half of the pizza that we ordered were decent  i live in south philly and i just think that they need to do a little better considering the area  i dont think i would bother giving them another chance there are too many other places to trywow 4 for a cup of coffee the coffee was ok definitely not worth 4 there are coffee shops nearby that have comparable coffee and better prices the people were nice and the shop is cool but i cant justify spending 4 on a 16 oz coffeethis is my second time to cosi i come to 30th street often last visit i needed a quick dinner so stopped in for a sandwich this time breakfast   i was happy with the number of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu the food is actually decent i was really impressed with my breakfast wrap this morning and probably would get it againat a different location   two problems the portions are very small and the customer service is horrendous   i ordered the tbm for dinner and thought oh for 56 the half is plenty i feel like there was two bites and my sandwich was gone my breakfast wrap was the same way im not looking for a gigantic serving size but these portions are tiny   both trips to this location the service was awful when i came in for dinner i asked the lady how she was doing as i always do before ordering and she looked at me blankly and said what do you want this morning different lady same response when she gave me my number i wished her a good day and she said yeah when my food came out i thought the gentleman said a totally different number and when i asked him what number he said he called my number i apologized and he literally threw my bag on my table and walked away no other words spoken with the slogan be kind to each other cosi really needs to step it up im not looking for some feel good smiles and sunshine place in the middle of downtown philly but goodness they could stand to improve their service   i think ill likely stick to the convenience store for a quick bite and to the breakfast spot next door for hot foodsorely disappointed  ordered takeout on a friday night lamb  bison burgers w sweet potato fries  vidalia onion rings  everything was extremely bland no flavorseasoning whatsoever the fried batter on the onion rings was a let down on first bite sweet potato fries seemed that they were just cut  baked w a few scarce grains of salt  the burgers were justsad the best part were the sauces on the side for the togo burgers probably made by somebody who actually cares how their food tastes  given the high cost for our low quality meal i do not intend on returning to this establishmenthunger was running wild and hopes were high for something special upon finding pizza mizza most of the time your pizza options at the mall are pretty much limited to sbarro so it was cool to find an independent pizzeria with classy wood paneling tvsaplenty and nice patio seating the inhouse menu didnt include their appetizers those are only on the takeout menu for whatever reason but we settled in on a fine pie unfortunately the pie was totally bush league we received thin crust instead of regular as wed ordered it was overcooked to the point that they cut the charred crust off of a few slices before serving it super tacky because the crust was so crunchy you couldnt fold these crustless slices without cracking them in half it was pretty disappointing because they didnt hold back on the toppings and the thing smelled pretty fantastic oh well our server must have had a hot date too because the service went from prompt only slightly forgetful and notparticularlyfriendly during the early part of the meal to rushed and cold by the end maybe they close at 8 pm sharp and we had overstayed our welcome who knows anyhow i can get flawed pizza and underappreciation all over town ill stick to woodstocks for a good piethey need to bring back the scale the prices of the different size cups are not worth iti know these guys have a big following and i am new to this chain and wanted to give it a go   i showed up at 1145a  there are maybe 4 people in line at this time of day   i ordered a small cheeseburger and small fries i wanted to start with something easy    it took a nearly 15 minutes to get my food but i had high expectations so i did not mind plus they have those peanuts they offer to keep me busy   the fellow serving up the food did apologize for my wait and it was nice that he noticed it took longer than a burger and fries should take  fries a lot oily i have to say  crisp is not a word that i would use to describe them  plentiful they are generous with their fries portions   burger wow it was so average  a little on the dry side but it was a small burger  i do not like chopped onions on my burgers i am old school and i like a slice of onion on a burger chopped is fine for dogsbut not for burgers    sorry guysconvenient location service varies last time i went was fine but this isnt always the case their hygiene procedures are not where they should be i watched an employee make a sandwich handle the money and then begin on the next sandwich without ever taking off her gloves subway pays min wage and the patels who own most of the nashville locations are very rude and treat their employees like dirt so its no wonder no one stays long not to mention the only things that are actually fresh are the onions cucumbers and tomatoes even their guac squeezes out of a bag its all frozen just like any other fast food place and they overcharge on beverages and its like 60 cents more for an extra piece of cheese i most likely wont returntasty food small portions the ice cream is amazing smaller portions for higher prices the booths are the most adorable seats ever my kids kept closing the curtains for privacy which was fun the staff is what you would expect of this sort of place  sort of pretentious with that i wish you werent here wasting my time attitude but what trendy place doesnt have this sort of staff anymore id argue the answer to that is very few  my husband went out of his way to say i know you have a sundae gambler which means you get what you get but i want the what the waitress on her break is eating next to us then received some godawful concoction instead that he couldnt return because the menu explicitly says sales are final on this and couldnt eat because it was basically every gross thing they had behind the counter thrown on some basic ice cream but still had to pay for so you know dont seem excited to be there and maybe theyll treat you nicelythis place is wayyy overpriced and the sushi isnt all that great ordered the spider rolls tempura and an eel rollservice was alright and nice setting  ive had better at smaller sushi places such as  terryinn i wouldnt bother coming here again only reason was of the outside seating next to the fountain and because i live in walking distancefor anyone who knows or really loves q this is not going to impress overpriced and under flavored a ride to try some of the citys best mom  pops not far is worth it comparatively location in south tampas townhome zone will keep it busy walking distance or an easy drive for many residents and its better and cleaner than jimbos though im not a fan of either nevertheless it just doesnt burst with smoke spice or texturesensation that low and slow meat fans crave for ribs ill mention first choice in brandon  simply unsurpassed and kc quality yes worth the drive down the crosstown and mandatory attendance if going to bass proevery  once in a while its fun to play tourist in your own town with that said the 65 price for a couple of crabs some melted butter six onion rings some romaine lettuce croutons dressing and a cup of bland chowder was not worth it   for that price i kind of expect some semblance of service real silverware and maybe a cloth napkin here you get to order at a window and wait for your number to be called  your food is presented on paper plates with plastic forks and thin paper napkins that dissolve like tp so you need to use about 30 of them   the view is always nice out here on the pier and thats what the two stars are fori am a frequent customer and have been for years i have watched this place slowly deteriorate to be fair i usually only have a coffee and sometimes a scone the scones are fabulous  the coffee however is now barely drinkable please please use a decent coffee your current brand is terribledoesnt live up to its potential love the atmosphere and bar but i have never enjoyed a meal there been there at least 10 times due to it being nearby and friends wanting to go  most recently my food was gross and misrepresented on the menu and the server who seemed really nice but also really busy trying to get out of there for the night did not ask to box up my virtually uneaten plate or ask if something was wrongthere are better places in tucson to buy your alcohol knowledgeable staff and a unique selection of wines and liquors can be found at plaza time market or rumrunner   so what brings me to bevmo pretty much its just logistics now that beverage house on broadway has closed its closest to my eastside homei went to this location for the first time just recently the reason we decided to go to this location was because were given a gift card i have been buy this restaurant many times but never a desire to go in overall i was not impressed with this restaurant i had the chicken parmesan and it was not the greatest i also felt the service was very slow and disorganized do not have an interest to visit spasso in media i feel there are better options in mediai am surprised im giving this place such little stars because im a huge fan of all 4rivers locations ive been to in the past their food is delicious staff is friendly and the food comes out quick easily a 55 star experience   and it wasnt much different this time all 3 of those things happenedbut i ordered the 6 chicken wings to dine in and they put it in a black styrofoam plate and the warmth of the wings literally burned several holes through the plate the styrofoam material from the plate was melted into the wings i feel like it should be common sense not to out scalding hot items in a black styrofoam plate i read that the melting point of those plates are 464 degrees fahrenheit but it starts to soften around 80100 degreeswhy would food cooked at a warmer temperature be served on those types of plates that material is carcinogenic cancer causing   i was in such disbelief that i didnt even think to take a picture of the plate i went back to the check out area and told the girl about it and she said shell get me some new wing in a different plate and what happened they put it in the same kind of plate again i moved the wings to the big plastic tray before the wings made new holes on the plate i just couldnt believe the obliviousness   i know 4rivers is a good business and this was probably hopefully not something that happens often i hope the reevaluate their serving method for hot items ill be back to reevaluate my review eventuallywe used to come here once a week for breakfast and im thinking that we need to find a new place the cinnamon rolls used to be the high point of the visit they used to be so moist and full of cinnamon goodness now the outside of the rolls are so hard you could break a window with them have hardly any icing on the top and the inside doesnt have the beautiful swirl of cinnamon its almost like the cinnamon rolls were made without butter or the cinnamonsugar mixture my other favorite here used to be the pumpkin crumb muffins boy when they get a new baker maybe we will come backbrought this in sierra vista at the outdoor market  we brought the manicotti  and our friends brought the lasagna with extra sauce   had it tonight and was very disappointed  bland  it needed italian seasoning but we do  like the concept of no salt and organic  just more  seasoningthe crab cakes are more cake than crab which is disappointing they are also served with honey mustard which is a bit strange it overall made the dish way too sweet the lobster chowder is tasty but it was served to me cold by cold i dont mean refrigerator cold but it was cooler than room temperature that was disappointing the shrimp were okay but i was kind of done mentally by the time i got to themcame here for sunday lunch  decided to check this branch out since we love the chateau cafe in kenner  place was halfway full  it was 1130am but they still hadnt brought out the lunch menus  this shouldve been a warning sign  nonetheless husband and i ordered paid and tipped the 20 sat outside to take advantage of the pretty day and waited  and waited  and waited    32 minutes later husband goes in to check on our food  2 minutes after he sits back down waitress comes out with my sweet potato fries and quesadilla  she then barks our burgers are made fresh  it depends how you want them cooked  they take a while  eh husband just wanted it medium done  instead of getting bristly and defensive she shouldve just said im sorry for the wait yall  itll be out anytime soon  thank you for your patience  we wouldve left it at that and not written this negative review  oh right the food  the sweet potato fries were ok veggie quesadillas were supergreasy hamburger patty was big and underdone and french fries were cold  not coming back here lifes too short to waste on slow sullen service and mediocre foodif you dont have the money to lose dont go there im a non smoker and its disgusting the smoke in the air they use to have free drinks on the floor not anymore and they use to have a non smoking roomnot anymore  ate at the hard rock cafe the food was good but be prepared to wait a very long time for service food and drinks we waited over 20 mins for a rum and coke when it did come the ice was melted and the glass was soaked with sweatthat means it was made when i ordered it but sat at the bar til the server got around to running it to our table video poker is your best bet if you dont want to lose your shrit slots pay out very little before you know it that win and your money is long gone i cant wait to get some new casinos around here that are more like the ones in vegas fat cats making big money and were all dumb enough to go back handing over our money thats life i guessi had high hopes for bennas west i love the mural on the interior wall and the vibe of the place but the food was a big let down ive never been one to leave a negative review but here it goes i ordered the praline french toast which was served cold  i gave the staff a heads up about it to which they asked if i wanted a refund once i said i wasnt interested in my money back but just wanted to give them a heads up their concern seemed to end not the response i had hoped for might check back in a few months but on the whole it was a bummer for sureive been bummed on pks food ever since spring 2009 when they took the fish and chips off the menu and believe me i kept trying til recently goodbye churchill burger too   i want to continue to like the barbut going any time past 730 pm its been pure loud chaos in there to end on a positive though ill keep stopping by every so often for their oyster special that is til they take that away toovery unhappy for a first experience here when i entered the store i asked if i could sample the yogurt since i am not a fan of greek style yogurt the woman took a spoon and proceeded to walk me to the flavors and ask which one i wanted to try i told her i would like to try two she said i could only try one  after sampling one flavor i got my yogurt and toppings i think the topping choices were limited compared to other yogurt shops in the city i took out my debit card and she proceeded to tell me there was a 500 minimum for cards i told her i did not have any cash the total was 470 after telling her i did not have enough cash she made an exception and took my debit card  i asked for a glass of water while i was sitting and eating my yogurt and she said they have no glasses but i could buy a bottle for 100   two other people came in to get yogurt and had the same problem with the credit card situation the cashier actually asked the friend who had just paid in cash to lend money to her friend so she could pay  i would not go back and support a local store that had people working there who were so unaccommodating i would rather walk 5 blocks down the road and go to another storei was very optimistic but the say cheesesteak which both my wife and i had was very underwhelming the cheese itself was tasty but the meat for both of us was somehow both dry and fatty and just not a great experience the menu has potential but the actual sandwich is disappointingly lackluster i should point out that this is also the 3rd time i tried to eat there after hearing a great review from vegetarians maybe stronger for them and say cheese being noshows at different events they were scheduled for not worth the effort to have finally tracked them down im afraidseriously tho why change the noodles from beef noodle soup to some cheap non chewy dry noodlesso disappointed the breakfast burrito was not what i remember it was flat and unfulfilling lacking the girth of breakfast burritos of the past underwhelming and approximately 23 oz lighter then before gave two stars because the fries were plentiful on others meal and the fry sauce was decent so sad that what they used to be known for is now non memorable and possible reason we have little intentions in returning anytime soonmy first stop on my first visit to armature works and i was tempted by the chicharrones on their appetizer menu being the addict that i am to this cuban crispy crunchy juicy fatty delectable morsels of pure yumminess if you have this weakiness like i do dont fullfill it here as you will be sadly disappointed there was no crispy crackling skin and merely skinless seasoned pork belly dropped in to the deep fryer and fried to a dark brown color the only things good were the sauces served with it which were a spicy habanero based one they called cuban fire water and an avocado sauce to cool the palate a tad the servers were friendly and attentive for which i gave two instead of one star with all the choices of food at this venue i probably would try others before i gave this one another tryyesterday was our second time eating at this red robin location the first time we ate at red robin and the service was a bit slow but we figured maybe next time it will be better nope id say last nights experience was worse  never got a refill on the fries our server said hed bring napkins never received the napkins and it took forever to get our to go boxes it took about 15 minutes to finally get the to go boxes the burgers are good although we tried some boneless wings and you could tell they were just frozen not fresh at all  our server basically forgot about us and didnt check back with us at all my rating is based on the service we received mostly the food could use some improvementi was happy about the hours of the place because i wanted to stop and grab a batch for the family and it was almost 8pm however paying 18 for 6 cupcakes that were dry taste was definitely nothing special was a bit muchthe pancakes were pretty damn good but thats where the good ends the line is absolutely ridiculous the service is slow when you finally do sit down and worst of all the coffee is absolutely dreadful and im pretty sure the fresh squeezed orange juice is just minute maid what is it with breakfast places making amazing food and shtty beverages itd be like a 5star steak restaurant only serving pbr to go with their filet mignon sure youre going there for the steak but would it really hurt to step it up in the beverages department yeah i get it the pancake pantry is known for its pancakes but i like a well rounded breakfast with good food and beverages bottom line unless they step it up in the coffee department ill go elsewhere like fido or frothy monkey where the joe is good and i dont have to wait 45 minutes just to sit downi am torn i liked the cafe the ambiance the people i liked the soup but some salt pepper and hot sauce on the table would have been nice maybe they were around but the soup was nice enough to live without it  the sandwich premade and came out hot on the outside and refrigerator cold in the middle it should be one or the other portion was good flavour nothing special  the coffee i should have known better i saw the bag of transcend on the bar i prefer my coffee with out sugar and if it is a drip i take it black i asked for a cappuccino a nice flat capp colouring a bit dark with a bit of a leaf poured into the centre of a very attractive cup i took a sip and knew immediately like most transcend coffee i have tried i would need to disguise the flavour  off to find the sweets  next time i would have teai was disappointed i hated that very much because i was so excited to visit my servers were overwhelmed for no reason because the place isnt big enough to bring an overwhelming crowd i ordered the banana french toast and it  was basically slop on my plate not sure if thats the norm but i was not impressed we did order a bottle of champagne which was 25 and came with unlimited juice i think it would have been better on both ends to simply charge a flat fee for bottomless mimosas i spent the majority of my visit mixing my own mimosa not ideal for a saturday brunchbeing able to buy baked goods and pizza in the same place sounds amazing right i went in kermits for the first time today i asked the woman at the counter what their popular items were i like to ask the people that work at food establishments whats really good because 1 they usually have so much enthusiasm about it and i think thats awesome and they could sell me anything at that point and 2 theyre getting the feedback everyday and seeing what people are going crazy for under her breath the woman mumbled the pizza is good our popsomethings are goodpeople like the ice cream sandwiches no enthusiasm and barely audible   im looking at the pizza the pop whatevers the little desserts and im like do i really want to spend money on this right now i get a slice of pizza and a flourless double chunk chocolate brownie and head home the pizza was meh honestly it didnt really look fresh non of the slices did and it was small and thin i got the sausage and peppers which was flavorful but underwhelming the brownie was tasty even better once i popped it in the microwavecalled to ensure theyd be open when we arrived they said they would be arrive before their stated closing hours lights on but closed two stars for bad servicehave been going to this panera for a steady week now being on vacation in this area panera is a great place good selection good coffee etc however this particular panera has gone down in the quality of service the bagels were burnt for three days in a row and they still try to serve it to you wondering if youll notice  today we ordered a frozen mocha and it took all of 15 mins to get it and that was after going up to the counter to get the girl to stop talking to coworkers and focus on our order which she had messed up and had to redo on a good note theres a very nice friendly lady who cleans up and always is smiling and professional besides the good selection of food shes the best thing to this panerafoods ok  sucks they dont have anything smaller then the sloppy monster slice sometimes its just too much also they claim to sell tarantini panzorottis  but they are always twice as big as a real tarantini and cheese never fully melted still searching for somewhere in or near medford that sells a real tarantini panzorroti after reading the very mixed reviews here i decided to roll the dice and try ghinis for breakfast they have a very elegant website and that was part of my decision to go i was underwhelmed the ambiance was that of a minimall diner plastic menus are not appealing to me but these were even dirty as was the table and several other tables in the indoor section i took a table in there was noticeable crumbs and stuff on the floor as well after watching my waitress cart a huge tray of food out to the patio the patio dining area fronts right on the parking lot for the mall and so did not appeal to me i decided the place was understaffed which may also explain the slowness and lack of coordination in the kitchen i ordered there provencal special with added hash browns and a side of bacon the hash browns were outstanding and well worth the 175 additional  if i had a normal portion as it was i received what seemed to be a half order or a childs portion of the most enjoyable item on my plate  the first thing i received was my coffee i ordered my coffee black expecting to receive a french roast but the coffee was bland and disappointing it came with  plastic creamers another disappointment in a french cafe the mini baguettes that came with my breakfast were embarrassing they were similar to frozen diner rolls from the supermarket really absurd when a socalled french bakery is sharing the same space with your french caffe on the way out i bought a peach turnover on the bakery the crust was pretty good but there were only 3 tiny slices of peach inside overall the food was ok overpriced and over hyped i ordered the side of bacon because the website declared that ghinis serves thick sliced maple cured bacon instead i received 3 slices of thinsliced oscar mayer or equivalent bacon for 450  worst of all my breakfast arrived but no bacon i went ahead and started on my breakfast and by the time the bacon arrived i was almost finished  i should have sent it back and saved the 450 but the waitress was nice and i just let it go ghinis suffers from poor management excessive pricing poor decor and a slow kitchen i was glad i checked it out but would not go there again hope this has been helpfuli read that this was one of the top 20 ice cream parlors in the country i went with high expectations i was disappointed evidently they are famous for their weird and off the wall flavors i tried quite a few of them including lavenderhoney and chocolatecayenne nothing was wowed meat all  me and 2 of my friends wound up ordering simple fruit flavored gelato it was good the service wasehokay nothing spectacular tastee freeze is just as goodi am so disappointed to have to give red kings 2 a 2 star rating all other past experiences here have always been great  the food was delicious and the perfect amount of spice  kick the griddle meats were fried to the perfect amount of juiciness and crunch and the cumin dishes were just mouthwateringly fantastic but tonight such fond food memories are gone  pros  unusually quick service normally there would be a 15 minute wait time for our food to arrive but tonight it was out to our table within 5 minutes of us placing our order not sure if the speediness contributed to the lack of flavor in our dishes  rice here is really good they steam it with the right amount of water to produce perfect white fluffy rice grains  they have a new menu that has a lot of pictures great for individuals new to szechuan cuisine   cons  cumin chicken had no flavor whatsoever the onions had more flavor than the chicken  boiled beef was way more oily than i last remembered it i remember the dish being more soup base with chili oil as a flavoring agent andor enhancer this time around it seemed the beef and cabbage were just sitting in a bowl of chili oil and no soup broth  they have lowered the standard spice level they once cooked at  if this is the new quality standard red kings 2 cooks at i am greatly saddened my housemates and i loved coming here for warming food during bitter cold nights now we will have to look elsewhere for delicious late night eats within chinatownbottom line  over priced food unprofessional staff dirty atmosphere  great view of the ocean  you know the food is fresh  horrible service no refillsconstantly getting up to ask for things even had to go to the waiter to pay i honestly felt like just leaving since they obviously didnt want the moneyusually pretty good but just ordered 2 large plain for the manic monday special and specified well done delivery just showed up and both pies are undercooked not regular undercooked wonder what wouldve happened if i didnt ask for well donecold unflavored tacos found a pad of butter in the rice of the which also was unflavored this may of been on step above taco bell i would consider going to chipotle i cant empathize how much i disliked this mealthe coffee is pretty good they have a good selection of pour yourself pots the only negative is that the music is a horrible mix or top 10 and 90s rock hardly a relaxing atmosphere to drink your coffee and enjoy a good bookgreat atmosphere but the service and food was a comedy of errors you order at the counter and there are no menus out so there is i description of what each dish containsyou have to guess or ask the employee taking the order who doesnt know what is on it  we ordered a cheeseburger hamburger cobb salad tea and a latte the cobb salad was good the bacon was a little funky and the pickled onions would have been better left in the jar the service to the table was slow and the hamburger was cooked as a cheese burger so we sent it back and the staff apologized saying they had new kitchen help 10 to 15 minutes later it showed up but had shrunk to a kids burger like a white castle burger and no fries the fries did come out later  so for coffee and pastries this place would be great but for lunch or dinner id recommend someplace elseso heres the deal the food is quite good but the way this place does business is pretty horrible  if you live in nashville and someone special is visiting you or youre here for the first time then sure go to pancake pantry and stand in line for over an hour to get the food but if youve already been there and you just need breakfast go someplace else  as i said the food is great but the experience is pretty horrible  ive been here several times once when we first moved here and then more times with outoftown visitors and every time im dumbfounded by how poorly the restaurant itself and the entire customer experience is managed  last time we waited in line with my 82 year old grandma they said she could wait by herself in their tiny crowded entryway for us to work our way up in the line but refused to seat for over an hour in the cold then their uncaring host sat all 5 of us around a square 4person table when i said why are you putting us 5 around a 4 person table instead of a bigger one he said thats how be do things then as we watched he sat 3 people at a 6person booth then combined 2 4person tables for another group of 5 and the list goes on  then after waiting in line for over an hour we sat there for half an hour until a very kind cute but unattentive woman finally came over and got our drink orders which was extra strange because she walked passed us probably 25 times as we sat there next to the drink station then we watched as all the tables around us who had arrived after us got their food ate and left before we even got our drinks then we sat around waiting for our food even longer as whole other tables had their order taken got their food and left  when we finally got our food it was very delicious and we enjoyed it but we were done eating in about 10 minutes then we stood in another line for several minutes to pay then we got the hell out there  any business person can see that for the almost 2 hours that we were there we only spent about 10 minutes eating  if they would clean up their act understand how customers actually want to interact with them implement new procedures to actually be efficient with their space tables seating and serving they could greatly improve the customer experience and allow those who love the food but hate the experience the chance to spend our money there more often  also even if you only count the time we were at the table if they were to actually get on the ball they could have have probably 5 different groups of paying customers at that same table rather than just us paying once  bottom line try it once  after that unless you really love it or want to get up to be there when they open when the lines are shorter dont bother going back the owner has a whole blurb on the menu about how they have such great quality well the food is great but the quality of the experience is horriblethanks to extremely poor customer service that is driven from the store management my wife and i go out of our way to avoid this starbucks  things like no multiple orders in the drivethru even on a slow day  there seems to be high staff turnover and many of the staff are lessthancompetent even at the simple task of making coffee by recipe or running a till  head to 91st  ellerslie or windermere for a better experiencefood good on a road tripall the cooks and servers were not wearing gloves the cashier was patting down cheese on fries to go in a micro wave type machine and then took money from drive up all in front of my eyes big concern herelets start by saying your rewards program is absolutely horrible guest services wouldnt tell me how much i could get max for a meal you have to pay for your drinks the food is mediocre depending on where you go now you cant use your points for the food court council oak has great food but 9 dollars for a side of corn and their pricing is way overrated the slots are good tables have a lot of people who have no idea what theyre doing these are the 25 dollar tables because thats all they usually have i went on a sunday morning at 7am and the tables were 25 its the only casino except for the casino boats which are better sometimes but seasonal theres about 15 of table dealers that actually have fun with you and have great customer  service from the north and loved mohegan sun  get it together tampai guess tourists make up about 95 of the customers here typical greek food nothing special there are other greek restaurants that have way better food in the area this place gets busy during the weekends for no apparent reason the service here is annoyingly bad each and every time my family chooses this place we always get the worst waiter i recommend going somewhere else for better greek food this place will not overly satisfy you unless you have never tried amazing greek foodi really want to give this place a million stars but the pizza was decent and the fettuccine alfredo was okay the chicken was dry and the sauce had just a bit of flavor however the delivery person was so kind and the service was wonderful it was an okay place to grab an early evening delivery meal after not wanting to leave my hotel roomwe didnt actually make it to dinner they screwed up our reservation so badly we left never a good place at that location unfortunatelyi really enjoy ccs coffee but every single time i go into this place the employees are miserable yesterday was the first time i actually had someone smile while ringing me up however the person making my drink still looked like they had been sucking on a lemon bitter i should also mention they are not usually busy when i go in there so its not being overwhelmed by the amount of work that makes them so rude   wish they could get some customer service training because a smile and a thank you really go a long waythe food ok the service bad  walked in the the cafe with a friend and ordered 2 indie grilled cheeses pears with five spice and honey with gouda on rye bread  the guy taking our order looked confused as to what he was supposed to be doing  i also ordered a chai which he completely forgot about  the computer wasnt working so he told us to order at the bar10 min later the bartender shows up and just laughed and said what the hell is a chaiand sent us back to the cafe  we finally did get our sandwiches btw no gloves used after a bit  they were good a little too overpowering  could use some sort of salty or savory elementwe came here around 1230pm and there wasnt much to choose from they tasted like regular donuts tbh  nothing strange about them not even the 2 creation onesthe last time i was at ghinis was in 2009  it was a weekday so less busy and the service was quick i remember being blown away by the food   just went back this past weekend to celebrate my brother and his new fiancees engagement i ordered the provencial  which is pretty much two thick slices of tomato and two eggs i paid 825 for that well 2 buttermilk biscuits too it was a nice fresh healthy breakfast but not worth the price tag  the bro and husband both got the corned beef hash they were starving so i didnt try it as i didnt want to lose a finger they seemed satisfied but neither was raving new sisinlawtobe had the italian omelette which was just ok   the service was pretty atrocious it took forever to get our food they mixed up part of our order and in general it seemed as if the two servers were confused and forgetful as they scurried around they were nice just not on their agame i suppose  and the restroom is a strange large room they have one of those helper toilet seat things that you can roll on top of the toilet for those that need assistance sitting down and standing up which is nice for those that need it but gross for everyone else as that is the first thing you see when you open the bathroom door  plus they are dog friendly  we had our two pups with us on the patio and they brought out water and some dog treats for them which was sweetgreat location friendly welcoming staff but falls down with odd soup oily salad and the lamb special prepared much earlier in the day i have not yet had until todayeither a pita or naan bread that was so burnt and dried out that it was not chewable  another middle eastern restaurant just opened its doorskabsa i have been in before just for a juice seen what looks like some tasty and interesting foods  i have been told that the king fish steak is halibutso i planned to try it today i was told  they moved from downtown 2 months ago to whyte ave and ran the same name restaurant for 11 years before ending up here   i came in today to try the king fish steak and was told they didnt have any they did say each day they have a special so i ordered that it was a lamb dish with soup and rice  not 5 minutes later a large order of rice and lamb appear with a partally charred pita bread i  dont think it was naan bread  i first think i wont be able to finish it all very large portions adorn the disposable plate i try the soup and cant figure out the taste large carrots and peppers and potatoes but little taste there are mushy parts at the bottomnot sure what it was so i skip it altogether  i start with the lamb that has been simmered so it falls of the bone i like the portions but have had better lamb at other buffet tables elsewhere in the city  the heaping mound of rice are mixed with seasonings they  also provide 2 small side containers of a clear hot chili pepper mix and a cream dipmaybe its yogurt i dont know  i also skip the dipstry them but they dont help with the meal the blackened crispy pitanaan is hard to chewover crispy and does not really go with anythingits not stale but it is dried out and burnt so it is discarded  the salad which is some lettuce tomatoes and red peppers and white onion are drizzled with a lot of oil it lost its crispy freshness and reminds me of a greek saladminus the olives and feta cheese nothing really stands out in taste or flavor i think the daily special was prepared much earlier in the day   i came around supper hour so i think its should be their freshest dish to offer they even suggested it  but i leave disappointed  wow do they pile up on the rice  i get the rice to go leave the soup salad  but cant get seem to get that lamb and spice smells to stay at the restaurant   it reminded me sort of like mall foodthe ready to go kind the lamb special costs 1500 so after 2 months here they may have to iron out some food quality and taste improvements    i wish them well the staff were very nicemaybe it was an off day  im kinda glad i didnt get to try the fish dish after all some people came in checked out the foods and left so hopefully its still in the developing stages   i am told  that in 2006 or 2007 they were named as one of the best visited middle eastern food places to eat in edmonton i will look forward  to those days againthis is one of the local starbucks that is definitely hit and miss sometimes the oder is perfect sometimes screwy sometimes you order mobile and the order is ready when you get there and sometimes they havent even realized it is there and then there is the time when a woman has her child and her dirty bare feet standing on the counter at checkout and the star doesnt open their fing mouth to ask the woman to move the child it seems as it the woman works there if theyd like i can come put py bare feet on the counter and see what they say better yet have them bring me home and i can put my feet on their kitchen table unsanitary for surethis place has awful service  all the employees looked like they hated their job even managers non of them had any sense of urgency to get customers taken care of we waited a good 10 15 minutes just to order because the guy running the register couldnt handle more then order at a time when will this location get a drink station in lobby so u dont have to wait forever for a refillwe had lunch on a tuesday the inside is very nice   if you only have an hour for lunch this is not your spot  the waitress was nice but with few people in the restaurant 25 minutes is too long to wait for food    the food is ok and expensive  ive had much fresher food at casita taqueria for a lot less   will not returnwas not happy with my oil change  i went to walmart because they opened at 7 am which is nice when you are expecting a crazy saturday however i am not sure i actually got what i paid for  i can say with certainty that my tire pressure light is still on even after going back and asking them to recheck and that my carpets were not swept even though i paid for the step up service and my bill says carpet cleaning complete  will not returnim tough on mexican food i grew up on it in southern california our waiter attempted to school me on the topic which was privately amusing grandes version is supposedly authentic so you wont find burritos or fajitas im okay with that but the basic dishes they do offer are fairly plain and uninspired the guacamole was pretty good the best thing about this place from what i can tell is the bar the mixed and frozen drinks are impressive the decor is quite fun and entertaining other than some work on the menu my only suggestion is that they improve the lighting in a few of the main dining areas its stark and a little harsh fun pendant lights a cheap fix would do wonders to make for a more inviting and intimate dining experience definitely a great happy hour venueawful awful smoke in food court and everywhere we went wasnt very impressed with atmosphere even in non smoker section either food in food court was amazing though at cuban place but wouldnt recommend any of othersmust eat here on our nashville trip was not what i expected from the recommendations and reviews  stood in line for an hour in the rain  still wet from the rain and glad to finally be inside only to realize that if feels like thermostat is set at 68 degrees and now were freezing  full dining room is noisyloud and the diner quality breakfast fare was average at best  waitress was efficient and food came out in an appropriate time but there just wasnt anything special that i could see  restrooms needed attention i was with a party of 7 and wanted to cut the pancake pantry some slack because they did pull some tables together for us when we finally made it to the door  most at our table ordered combinations of eggspancakesfrench toast and etc  no one was very excited about their choices  menu is challenging for vegan preferences as they do not have any alternative to the milkegg based batter  no soyalmondoat milk available  oatmeal and fruit was the only thing on the menu for us pancake pantry oh well been there done thathad a beef noodle soup and the beef was almost inedible meet was a horrible cut and hard to chew probably was the worst beef noodle soup i ever had i walked in at a later time of the day so not sure if the quality would be better had i come earlieri have always loved frost gelato but tonight there was truly something wrong with the gelato i ordered my usual gianduiachocolate with hazelnut  it has never tasted like this before my husband ordered a peanut butter and that was also not same flavor as before  it had too much creme and not much peanut butter flavor almost tasting like milk my gelato tasted tart and something was off about it   i had my husband taste my gelato as well as i tasted his and we both agreed there is something not right tonight so i went inside to tell the very young person behind the counter about how it tasted tart and not fresh he turned and said to me  well we havent changed the tray yet then he tells me that different frosts locations sometimes have different colorstastes and depends on chef who makes it  that it could taste different i never heard anything like this before this young boy offered me another one but after his explanation i told him no longer interested and that i was throwing my gelato away in the garbageand did so in front of him he never said i will refund you  he just watched me toss an entire cup away as did my husband i did not care about the money but the fact he made excuses for something that was not rightis just wrong this is what happens to any good place turns into a franchise any pastry chef will tell you making desserts are like a science each measurement must be done right or it will never turn out the same  there must be a recipe they have to follow as well  sorry frost i have supported you since you opened in tucson but now i will not eat gelato in tucson  i love gelato and fortunately i do travel so i will have to wait to have my gelato when i return to italysummary awkward hostess odd vibe crunchy rice bland salsa stale chips long wait for food not busy decent margaritas average service   our party of four was greeted and immediately taken to a table in a very empty restaurant we were sat however next to the only booth within eyeshot that had people already seated at itand of these people 4 were fresh out of preschool and very excited to treat the booths like a jungle gym we requested to possibly be sat at any of the dozens of open tables and were met with resistance and excuses about some servers first day and wed be overwhelming after a minute or two of awkward glances and children climbing into the booth we were being sat in we were finally offered an undersized for our party table in another area service beyond that was ok margaritatequila options are good house margarita  sangria were yummy chips and salsa were stale and bland food took forever to arrive which was fine for us  we drank and enjoyed friends we ordered pretty standard dinners  enchiladas and burritos around the table the consensus was the rice was terrible crunchy the beans were ok everyone liked the the flavor of the meat chicken carnitas beef but there was nothing that stood out on any dish as being really good if youre craving good mexican food dont botherif you need a place where you can have decent drinks and talk with friends without having to search for parking or be subject to a long wait it worksim not sure which type of tour the bulk of these yelpers went on but the free tour is disappointing  the brief visit to the stables is by far and away the best part the rest of the tour was standard brewery tour garbage  brief history of the brewery a sample of bud or bud light upselling the birch chips to make the water beer seem better i wish they would do something more about the history of the buildings if they did that it would be a much better experience  i would have given the tour 1 star except they were patient with me sampling the tappers at the end  i settled on the goose island saison and it was delicious  the bartender told me the staff drinks that over bud so that should tell you something about the beer  where can you get a better free tour you ask come to milwaukee and miller will hook you up from the history video to the caves to the building histories to 34 free samples the miller tour is a much slicker and informative free tour i think bud could stand to send its employees on it to get an idea how to improve its own gamea seriously over rated pancake place we waited over an hour in line to try this local place out had the georgia peach pancakes honestly it tasted like box pancakes and canned peaches poured on top of it  coffee was medicare service was slow and prices were okas you know im a boudin snob ad i did not think these balls were any good they had barely any batter on them and they were small my ideal and perfect ball would be from billys in scott la they are huge with an inch thick of batter the taste with these balls wasnt there tasted like flavorless meat maybe i should have gone with a burgerhugely inconvenienced w having to come back 3 times to get these letters ordered 2 days ago and owner fully aware and involved in my service but didnt seem to have any regard for my timetrouble also the n unfortunately isnt as lucky as the m  all the other letters match in sizeshape i ordered them individually wrapped but said id do myself since they werent done  2525 for 1425 oz of chocolate letters that caused a lot of frustration on my partsuch a shame for year this place was our goto place for a yummy quick simple meal unfortunately recent changes have really taken the place to a newlow   a few months ago the drop off was noticed for instance i ordered a piece of chocolate cake to finish off an ok meal husbands dinner wasnt prepared correctly the cake was clearly old the entire side of it was hard when i told the waitress the problem she showed it to the manager who effectively told me there was nothing wrong with it i told him to eat it but id not be paying for it regardless of whether theyd take it off the bill which the waitress did eventually   hoping this was a oneoff weve returned several times since then and each time either the food isnt good or the prices are inconsistent yesterday sealed the deal when we wound up being charged 450 for a single blueberry pancake yes only 1  325 for a single pancake is insane to start off with but then hit with an extra 125 for about 12 blueberries when i mentioned this to the person at the register i got no response or acknowledgement of the issue at all   so not only is the product inferior the prices higher but the management is choosing to do nothing to rectify issues with their formerly loyal clientele there are other restaurants just down the street that will now get our business   three strikes and your out stargate we will not be backthis place has really good food and i normally dont have any issues here tonight i got here at 830 after waiting for 8 minutes i finally got seated granted they were busy however this does not mean they have to completely ignore us they could have said it would be a 510 minute wait  we finally got seated though and noticed it was happy hour until 9 so we ordered our shakes as drinks and then waiting for the server to come back and ask for our food order that actually did happen at a decent speed the food got ordered at 855 and then it took another 30 minutes before we got it at 920 my group and i decided we would pay for our half price shakes and then go somewhere else for food because we were there for way to long we started discussing where to go and right as we started getting up our food came literally right as we were getting up at this point the diner was at least half empty so really no excuse but even then at olive garden or any other busy restaurant we would have been served quicker than that food does not take half an hour to cook especially at a burger joint okay whatever so we eat and then asked for a manager the manager told us chicken does take a little longer to cook especially since we have changed how its cooked but i apologize wait so chicken takes 30 minutes to cook okay my 10 year old can cook chicken faster than that did we pluck the chicken too make a trip to the farm then we get the check check was timed for 943 and happy hour was not counted so we got that fixed now its time to pay right okay most people at this point wouldnt tip right so i look at our server whos taking the payment and told him hey dont let this get you down tonight you were nice his response sorry for the service and the tone of voice was definitely more of a f you but hey i still gave him 2 bucks  if you are here for food then please order to go order ahead but do not done in whatever you do donthad high hopes for this placetried it 4 timesprobably not returning because of these reasons donuts are disappointing they look great but as other reviewers mentionthey are just really big plain donuts with some unusual toppingsnothing to rave about not really impressed with the sliders either had the fried chicken slider twice and loved it the first timesecond time the chicken tasted so strange that i assumed it was offthe place was too busy to get anyones attention so just left had a few of the shakes and they were awful even the dole whip just seems too expensive for what you getcool concept it kept my 10yo daughter entertained but the food was lack luster  we had a couple of rolls they were ok steamed dumplings have had better and the hot teriyaki steak was tough and served lukewarm  i would go upstairs to the sushi restaurant on bay street zen bistro insteadstopped by for a late lunch today around 130pm to miss all of the crowds from the convention downtown we were told service at the bar would be quick but experienced the complete opposite wait staff was friendly but our sides arrived after we had already finished our burgers as well several other staff were shouting at each other from across the bar interrupting any type of conversation being had would only come back for the ice creamgood food  terrible service  throughout the entire meal the waitress we had made it feel as if she was doing us a favor by waiting on us   she spent the whole time chatting it up in the back with the manager and other wait staff  the most attention she gave us was when she delivered the check  of course  cant stand those type of servers  get it together tre lunadirty dirty dirty thats all i can say about this place i love the food but this location was gross there was a spilled drink all over he ground as soon as you walk in the bathroom had a puddle of god knows what on the floor i wish i went to the drive through wont be going back to this location if o can help itugh just tried them again because i wanted some pasta big mistake i ordered the beef lasagna  it was like a school lunch weird little meatballs like the ones you find in canned spaghettios covered with cheese  stuck in a broiler hardly a bit of sauce  the bread sticks should have just stayed at the restaurant awful i also ordered a piece of cheesecakelisted as a cheesecake factory product definitely not ive gotten the cheesecake they are talking about from sams club its great the crust was like dough not like a cheesecake crust the only reason i am giving them 2 stars is because the food was delivered on time  my canned coke was a highlight i wish so badly there was a quality italian delivery in east nashvilleill never order from here againi walked in and stood at the counter for 2 minutes before even being acknowledged manager walked by and didnt even greet me very poor customer service after i ordered to eat in the restaurant and got my drink i had a seat and waited for my food i saw an employee walk around with a to go bag looking for who it belonged to she went back behind the counter and then emerged with a receipt and an empty tray she aplogized for putting it in a to go bsg and handed me the empty tray the food was served hot and typical for the chain but what is lacking is the human interaction and customer service i refuse to order at a do it yourself kiosk that is what the employees get paid to do without the human customer servicewhat do they havei have been a pho fan forever the pho here is marginal what takes away from the whole experience is the rude counter personlook for somewhere elsemy family and i recently visited hendricks bbq for a birthday celebration our waitress was pleasant and kept our drinks filled which was great however the food took over an hour and a half to be served not once did anyone apologize my 6 year old daughter was with us and was so hungry she was in tears my uncle finally tracked down the manager himself and asked if this was normal his response was yes we are very busy the restaurant was not even 12 full i thought this was a completely inappropriate response if this is normal they need to post something up front and warn customers of the extremely long wait we even ordered appetizers which were subpar and they came out staggered after asking twice how much longer the beef brisket sandwich was quite tastey but the macaroni and potato salad were so gross i couldnt eat it  definitely save your money and go somewhere with way better servicei have given this place many many chances as i keep fooling myself into believing that maybe i caught them on a bad night but the service here is absolutely abysmal  every time weve been in we basically had to hunt someone down to wait on us  even when weve sat at the bar the bartender was too busy screwing off or not even behind the bar for the 10 minutes we waited before leaving and going to the nickel plate  there was no management anywhere that we saw to even complain to    its a shame because the mass ave location is awesome but this place is poorly ran and poorly staffed ill definitely just uber to langtons irish pub in carmel now  same vibe but impeccable servicecoffee was not good in my opinion overpriced as well its nothing personal but for taste it is very overpriced i wont be planning on going back i did get a bagel from where though and it wasnt bad    service wasnt bad just that the coffee wasi try avoiding this starbucks location ill even go out of my way to go to the other westshore location i i have enough time unfortunately tonight i did not have that luxury  the employees here are clueless everysingletime why i dont get it besides never knowing what they are doing or what is going on they are incredibly slow there are 2 other starbucks locations off of westshore i highly recommend going to one of those if you want to enjoy a coffee while you shopover priced food that wasnt very good  had the seafood pot pie and it was disgusting  wont be going backbeer was great food was okay service was abysmal every staff member besides the hostess was so rude wasnt even busy so i dont understand why they were so unpleasantnot nearly as good as other options in nashville most people that i know that rave about this place mainly go there to drink first of all cold flour tortillas do not a taco make not that they happened to be cold this is their intention  blah also the ingredients dont seem fresh at all tried the brisket once and i couldnt even chew the meat ive never left a mexican or tex mex place without finishing my food but i have here at least twiceanother trendy place with little more  to offer than the place to be seen we did not try the bar which was too noisy and too crowded  we ate outside and i am reviewing only the restaurant we ordered the burger but the waitress said we should order appetizer because the wait was 30 minutes thirty minutes for a burger well the burger are all cooked to order and many people are ordering it said the waitress we were kind of expecting that the food would be cooked a la minute we were not in a fast food joint  55 minutes later our food arrived one hour to cook two rare hamburger  the burgers were cooked as ordered good size but a little greasy nothing special just another burger produced by an understaffed kitchen which was not able to produce the food on time however there was no apology for the delay and when the bill came it was 18 for the burger mine was 1950 because i ordered fries look at the site from pub and kitchen they do not give the price of their burger wonder why do the math and you will spend over 70 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks including tax and tips in my opinion it is not worth ithow do you run out of potatoes at a breakfast restaurant on a sunday morning this the 3rd time this has happened to me at this particular location its not like there is a potatoe shortage make more potatoes i am able to write this review because this is taking forever time to find a new breakfast restauranti came here for lunch hour it was packed  i waited a long time for my food as well i was in a rush and i was just upset because they took a long time and they did not get my order right however its good food i enjoyed my delicious potato fries with all the high blood pressure salt that i like  you know what really hurt my soul that they only give you one ranch to like 10 pieces of wings i had hot wings and i love to eat my boneless wings and drench them in ranch sauce so i was angry that they would not give me any extra ranch sauce i had to pay almost 2 bucks for one sauce when i could go to the dollar store and get a whole bottle for like 1 i was disappointed because i had high hopes for this place based of coworkers hyping it up and it was just normal maybe ill go again and hopefully they wont be pack and mess my order up but for right now im going to end this with meh ive experienced betterive ordered from here for years they always delivered  knowing i live 3 minutes maximum away and my car was broke down  they refuses to deliver super upset  i was a very loyal customerlimited variety of frozen yogurt flavors to choose from several toppings are available though to try and compensate price is reasonable needs more seatingcame here recently for karaoke and was pretty disappointed with my overall experience especially the food  on entering the restaurant there is a small dining room and they lead you up some sketchy steps to where the karaoke rooms are in the room there was a large table surrounded by seats and a screen in the front with a computer for picking the songs   the service was pretty slow and it took a while to get a server in the room to order our food and drinks the menu was  interesting definitely not like the normal szechuanchinese food we were used to it was also a lot different than the menu we had seen online like a lot different the menu online has a huge variety of food items most of them recognizable the menu we were given had bacteria soup and dishes with blood it was like from a bad horror movie im not sure why there was such a discrepancy they did have some entrees that we recognized and those were what we ended up ordering   once we ordered the food came out very fast like so fast that i think they probably have ready made food and they just warm it up when a dish is ordered it tasted like that too pretty terrible overall the scallion pancakes were greasy and lukewarm the cashew chicken was the same plus was flavorless the fried rice was completely flavorless and looked like frozen rice you would microwave at home the dan dan noodles were oily and gross not spicy at all and were lightyears away from the han dynasty dan dan noodles the beef with broccoli and general tsos were fine but still not on par with standard chinese delivery food which i think is not that great to begin with the best dish of the night was the spicy fish which at least had some flavor and was cooked nicely its the only dish i actually went back for seconds most of the other food i left on my plate after trying a bite even though i was starving  the karaoke is fine and our group had fun with that the pricing is reasonable and was about 2530 a person for the entire night   im not sure why a lot of the reviews are positive maybe i went on a bad night either way i wont be finding out because you would have to pay me to eat here againive had items from this bakery a few times  the pies while pretty on the outside are not good when actually cut  the cherry pie especially is waaaaaaaaaay too soggy  they either need to precook the fruit to get the water out or add some sort of thickener like corn starch to the filling  i cut into the pie and the filling just started pouring out of the pie into the empty space that the first slice had left  continuing like that to serve guests was actually quite a mess and pretty disappointing given that the pie comes from a bakery  because of the overly wet filling the bottom of the crust is incredibly soggy    a guest had brought 2 berry pies from village bakehouse to a dinner party i was hosting and the same thing happened with both pies  i thought my experience was perhaps an anomaly but it turns out its par for the course  we also purchased some macarons and did a taste test of these with ones shipped from a ny bakery and therefore were at least 2days old  the ny macarons won hands down with my gueststhey said the village bakehouse ones were dry and tasted very old and i agree  they must be serving macarons that are at least a few days old  not goodi dont know what the hypes about this reminds me of the story of the emperors new clothes yes the place is crowded but i think its more of a place for usf students and teens to hang out at one of the four tables the ice cream or ice milk is so bland i thought that is tasted like frozen milk the toppings were cute but thats it we had thai tea and lychee and also the banana chocolate combo both were sub par im sure their successful but ive had better ice cream at jeremiahs dq and cold stone which has a similar concept the show is hibachi style lots of chopping but at the end of the show it leaves you empty i wish that i could give a better review but i gave them 2 stars one for being able to creating the system and not mixing up orders and another star for creating the hype with great marketing i give that student an aall in all at best it was ok at worst it was ok went here with a gaggle of people  lets see ill just list what was had what was good ok meh nothing was great  mushroom soup was good seafood bisque was good scallop appetizer was good but pricey for the plate tuna polke nothing extraordinary or even worth while to order again  entrees beef taco a complete fail small dried out meat terrible meatloaf  a horrid dried out saw dust like lump of coal sirloin  reportedly good although very pricey fig salad  reportedly meh one other entree had by a guest stated it was pretty good  service was meh seemed unprofessional and could have used more training it wasnt due to a lack of effort but so many common sense things were missed for instance no water was offered plates being passed over our heads dirty dishes not removed until asked dirty spoon dropped off plate and landing on a guest and the bus person mumbling something of an apology hmm come to think about it no the service was not good or managed correctly of course we over tipped  total for 5 including tip and a round 250 which was entirely too much for the over all experience on the level of an applebees but priced way over  fatty says swing and missso many people i know spoke highly of this place but i wasnt impressed  i thought it was very expensive and the food was average  their shakes tasted identical to a burger king shake which i couldve bought for much cheaper  this was a one and done for mewe used to like coming here  the past couple if times weve come here the service was half a i was constantly having to request to have our drinks refilled the lastime we were here they had no silverware  the lettuce for our salads was brown on the edges and my wifes burger had the wrong sauce on it which was spicy please get it togetherstopped in yesterday for lunch very busy at 100 i grabbed a seat at the bar but wasnt there for the lunch buffet though apparently most everyone else was there appeared to be 2 servers and one host available for the entire restaurant which was quite crowded but not to capacity i started with a spinach appetizer while i took my time to peruse the menu when the server finally returned i asked for an order of toro and an order of uni shed told me shed have to see if they had any she returned quickly only to to advise no they had neither she said they were seasonal ok then maybe that could be noted on the menu i didnt care for the spinach appetizer the long thick stems were attached big ones were not talking baby spinach and i could handle that but didnt at all care for the sickly sweet sauce that was pared with it i was expecting more of a peanut sauce shame on me for not knowing the difference i are less than half of the spinach goame appetizer   perusing the menu was a chore since many of the rolls are either deep fried or contain fried items i typically dont like anything in my rolls to be fried so at least half the the menu items would be off the list   i ordered a spicy tuna hand roll next there were three pieces of nigiri tuna within the roll with a splat of very tasty spicy sauce on top also included was a slice of avocado and some cucumber sadly the rice was not evenly distributed on the nori so literally the bottom 1  12  of the cone were empty   just the nori most times when ive had spicy tuna the tuna is chopped and mixed with the sauce but not always served this way it was much harder to evenly distribute the spicy sauce to all the bites some were very spicy some not at all i unwrapped the roll to try and redistribute the rice and sauce and was a little more successful but feel its a shame i should have to do this with a 5 hand roll really you cant even put the rice to the bottom of the nori    i then orderedagainst my typical preference  a roll with tempura shrimp  avocado it was tasty but the pieces were very very large i ate half of that as i mentioned that fried anything in rolls really isnt my style finally  finished with a sunset somethingorother roll that one was the best fresh salmon and tuna in very nice portions inside and the finished that happily   the server was adequate given how many patrons she had to cater to though my water was completely empty and i had to flag her down for a refill however when seated at the sushi bar i was forced to look at the dirty restaurant equipment with the back stainless wall caked in splattered grease the health food score in front showed the restaurant received a respectable 89 but i cannot see how based on what i saw yesterday the floors are worn servers overworked and menu advertises items they do not carry ive been to more than 30 sushi restaurants in and around nashville and the immediate area there are many restaurants less busy with much better food and much more reasonable prices than rusan   you wont catch me at this one again sad if this is all the gulch has to offerthe most disappointing froyo i have ever had the misfortune of consuming selection of yogurt was slim there were many topping options but the most basic obvious choices were absent i had the original tart and salted caramel salted caramel was flavorless original tart was almost too tart lending to a spoiled taste i actually felt bad giving a few spoonfuls to my dog i wont be returningi used to absolutely adore this place but as the saying goes do or do not there is no try  first off the poutine used to be awesome spread out on a plate the fries were evenly coated in gravy  you would hit cheese curds in the pile it was great now however it was served in a bowl the bottom fries were dry  there werent cheese curds so much as a large cheese glob on top  the salmon was my favorite thing on the menu i would drive down from phoenix for their pan seared salmon  red quinoa they took it off the menu i get it things change no hard feelings the fish special tonight was halibut on red quinoa with the same balsamic reduction my good old salmon used to have woot im up for that  i shouldnt have been the halibut was criminally over cooked dry as the desert it was being served in also they were either out of quinoa or the server had screwed up the special because the dry fish was served atop flavorless risotto   honestly the atmosphere was still lovely the service was still the alright as it has always been maybe a 3 star night however the bitterness of expecting magic  getting applebees if theres such a thing as a 30 applebees dish was a stars worth of disappointmentfood was fine but service was terrible 4 people  2 couples and dinner almost took 2 hours ordered an appetizer specifying that i would like it out first over 25 minutes later app comes out with the food than we dont see our server again no would you like another drink etc until he brings our bill 20 minutes later he comes back and we ask for a split bill and he responds he can only do it down the middle we wont be backfirst time my wife and i dined there it was last thursday night the place was half full nice environment  we sat in the back room where it was quiet   i had the broccoli soup and had to send it back it was not enough broccoli and too much chicken broth my wife unselfishly share her salad with me  dont know what it was but it was very good i had the linguine and my wife the salmon the linguine was fairly greasy and not very tasty i ate 25 and took the rest home i didnt eat eat later the salmon was good i guess i was having bad luck the creme brulee was nice i noticed that i was charged for french fries the waiter forgot to serve us it was taken off  all in all a fair but not good dining experience 2 glasses of wine appetizer entree desert and 2 coffees came to around 80 without a tip limited menu ill go somewhere else next time  i gave it 2 stars but it should be 2 12 starsits passable food probably more of a 25 stars type joint the place is nice and the staff is nice also the food was edible but nothing special   i felt the chicken was of relatively low quality and it had way too much seasoning to the point where you could almost not even taste the chicken the catfish also was not great overcooked and dry id stay away from here and try other placesi had really high expectations for this bakery since im a pastry chef myself they seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad we arrived at 1045 on sunday but there was no sign of life we thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11kind of odd for a bakery we had the blueberry hand pie it was good but probably not worth 650  no espresso drinks but they had drip coffee we will come back again in the future when they arent so newmy family and i stoped here on our way home at the end of our vacation we loved the building and decor of this brewery however when we went to get a growler of beer we were very frustrated every beer we loved we were told that they cannot put those into the growler  basically they were selling us their version of budweiser beer second the growler was 65 holy cow by far the most expensive we have seen to us they were selling the growler not their beer they were like here buy this amazing growler with our cheap ass beer lol  their food was nothing special either it looked pretty but nothing crazy to the taste worst money weve spent on a meal all vacation needless to say we will most likely never come back to this brewery ps the mac and cheese is deliciousokay food but extremely dirty always ask employees to wipe down tables and boothsnot impressed  the burger patty was very thin and over cooked  you are mainly eating a ton of bread with their burger  theres definitely better options for a great burger in the areai hope this gets back to the owner because they have two restaurants here in woodbury and i like to support the small businesses here in my town i paid over 12 for a salad from both of their restaurants which is fine when the salad is good but that was not the case i ordered one from their restaurant called gia ninas about a month ago and then one today from woodbury station cafe both salads were from a bag absolutely disgusting i could smell the preservatives as the waitress put the plate down in front of me how on earth do you own a restaurant and feel its okay to serve bagged salad never againthe food here is good and fresh and i have no complaints so far  it is a little pricey for instance last night i got  a gyro a small smoothie and a side of dolma and it was almost 19 wow  and they charged me  75 cents for extra sauce on my sandwich  really  it takes me about six months  between experiences  before i am willing to give this restaurant another try because i truly like the food   i always receive bad service  last night was no different   i even geared myself up before going in positive  smiling polite  ordered without hesitation  and all looked good  i was going to get through my experience without a problem    so  i  placed my order and waited and waited and waited  sat and read emails and texted for about 12 to 15 minutes   and then i notice that my order is just sitting there waiting to go but they havent made the smoothie because they rather keep taking orders  cooking orders and ringing up the cash register and because i dont want my food to get cold  i go to the register hoping my presence would trigger a recollection that i had an order pending  the servercashier asked if i needed something  i said i see that my order is ready just need the smoothie  smiling  he said well he hadnt got to that yet the other person in the store continues to make all of the orders that came in after me and the cashier keeps helping people and taking orders     then after hes helped everyone in the store he starts making my smoothie without washing his hands  health regulation that after you handle money you wash your hands before handling food  and i let it go   and get my semiwarm food and walk out    funny thing its the best experience i had there and the last for me  all of the other times were worse    bottom line   good food  terrible service and pricey   would i go there again  neverthe food was okay nothing spectacular the service however was not good at all our waiter was pretty much mia for most of the evening and the few times we saw him in the dining room he didnt come close enough to our table for us to wave him down and then he was gone again in addition to our alcoholic drinks my friends and i asked for water we got our one glass of water each but that was it no offers to refill nothing at all call me crazy but i like water with mexican food especially if its spicy or hotso i dont know why but i wanted meatballs so i came to wages and ordered a medium meatball not only did i only get 3 meatballs but it was like 4 dollars there was room to add more obviouslyi wanted to love this place  the yelp reviews were good and i was totally craving fried chicken today  well first of all the potato salad was delicious and i wouldnt change a thing  great balance between savoury and sweet with the seasoning and pickles in harmony  now to the chicken  it was indeed super crispy like others have said despite being delivered in a plastic bag but unfortunately it just  wasnt very flavourful  it was also overcooked  i usually privately will eat all the crispy fried bits off of a good fried chicken but i was not tempted to at all with this  in fact i avoided it where i could  the skin was also oddly flavourless  the chicken itself was stringy the batter was cooked too hard leaving it slightly burnt in flavour with no other flavours but overdone  too bad it looked fantastic  normally i also wouldnt be mad that a 6 piece pack contained 5 dark pieces and only 1 premium white cut as i prefer dark but regardless of part this was over cooked bland and stringy  the gravy also oddly tasted like it was beef instead of chicken based  not into it  wouldnt order any of it again but the potato salad but i cant ever see myself just ordering potato salad from somewhere  would largely not recommend for their classic crunchy fried chickenfirst timer ordered their turkey chili which was great had flavor also ordered their turkey provolone panini which was the most unappealing in taste of any sandwich i have eaten out the turkey had a gamey taste to it and the entire sandwich was hard to chew and bite off even  the price was more than i usually pay for lunch compared to other establishments in this neighborhood  not worth it i will attach pictures of the sandwich i only ate half it was not worth the effort to chew  i wanted to like this place but it did not live up to the hype on the menui was excited to try this place but i was disappointed its a tourist trap with food thats borderline ok the lobster bisque is ok a little on the salty side the shrimp tacos  seafood pasta were so bland  the crab cakes were on the dry side im not sure if we just ordered the wrong dishes but i definitely missed out on what the other yelpers were raving aboutwent here for lunch based on some of the reviews here  i was not impressed  i ordered the bento box with teriyaki beef  the soup tasted like salt water the fried rice flat out sucked  how do you screw up fried rice  it had a really odd flavor to it ive never not finished fried rice but left it alone  the beef was actually decent and the california roll was good  maybe would try some of their other sushi before i sign off of this place  oh and one of the employees came out to eat their lunch right next to us which was a bowl of the soup but he ate it with chopsticks  it was the loudest most disgusting sound ever  think of scooping soup out of a bowl and slurping it into your mouth  i thought it was a joke at first  thats probably standard practice for them but wowbeen here a few times nowyelps two star rating describes it best meh ive experienced better and after our last late night venture here we probably will not be back unless we are super hungry andor drunk as this place is 24 hours   food comes out fast like scary fast so fast even our hungry 10 year old son who usually complains that the food is taking too long made a comment about how fast it was lol food we have tried is mediocre at best their hash is weird its like par mashed potatoes that are grilled on a flat top to get the exterior crunchy and the inside is mushy with lumps pancakes and waffles are ok pies and cakes are storebought not made in house  service is good though gotta give them that we received friendly and fast service the times we were there prices are cheap portions are huge you get what you pay for thoughi got a burger from here once and it had a green mold spot on it after eating the sandwich not the mold i called the manager and she told me this was impossible that this happened pretty much saying i was a liar never did go there again and its been 3 yearswent here for lunch i expect this rating to improve once the shop has been open and is less crowded and they have a chance to really nail down their kitchen production process summary at bottom if tldr  location not bad sansom is one of my favorite streets in philly the new space is well decorated and pretty well set up there is an entrance on one side that leads directly to the order station and there is a assembly line and large pick up area after the waiting area is a bit tight but even with the large crowd i wasnt uncomfortable i like that you can see the entire kitchen completely open we sat against the wall and it was ample space to lay out our food  service friendly enough and efficient you can hear as they call your order number too didnt see many order mistakes and the manager was on top of things the wait in line took about 20 minutes unacceptable for lunch fare but not their fault persay and the food took about 10 a bit long when they had a massive pile of burgers cooked and ready at this point i cant sink so much time over my lunch break so be aware of this point   food i ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar medium and red onions and a side of truffle fries   burger first the bun is good but not what i expected it has the texture of stale bread but this ended up being great the burger held in place wonderfully and it did not fall apart like the softer potato rolls for example my burger was cooked great but was extremely salty on one side the cheddar was rubbery and flavorless and the onions were very overcooked mushy and flavorless the side of pickles was unexpected and a bonus i love pickles good size in my opinion but my food mate thought it was too small for the price almost looked like a slider 55oz uncooked patty overall it was a good burger but not great out of 5 i would give it 3 if the cheese and onions were better it would gain 1 because the meat was tasty and juicy the heart if you will   the truffle fries were a gigantic portion for 2 we should have shared a single order they were awesome and the smell of truffles was fantastic the flavor was not overpowering almost subtle addition to the fries the fries were not at all greasy which i really really appreciate and the way they were cut was great some were nice and crunchy and some were soft so there was alot to like here fries get 5 out of 5 the spicy fries were on par with these   milkshake god i wish i ordered one after seeing them make it   but i am sure my wallet 5 bucks and my stomach thank my brain for saving them from the looks of it though it would have raised the rating 1 star alone haha   value was the burger worth 550 in my ideal world no but comparatively in the market it wasnt outrageous total meal cost without drink was 9 after tax and i think that is slightly too much considering what you get but we could have also split the 2 fries for how many you get i couldnt make this a regular place to eat as i dont see the value   summary the wait times were prohibitive of a lunch time meal and the value is right on the border of being overpriced the jury is still out but i enjoyed the meal enough that i would go back 2 stars is not mean to be a put down and i think it is accurate of the food and experience i hope the lines get more manageable at lunch time though   me and my friend made an overunder bet on if this place would last goodburger didnt survive a year for the same issues i brought up with 500d value wait time however i expect it to last so took the over side i hope i dont loseive visited einsteins 5 times within the last month the store itself is clean theres ample seating but there is a distinct sense of chaos that is unmistakeable the instant you walk in the door during a busy time of day which seems to be just my luck  orders are taken and you are sheparded down the line only to discover that what you ordered is out of stock only moments later  this has happened on at least 3 occasions when ive ordered simply plain bagels and challuh rolls which i dont understand why these are even on the menu i think ive only gotten to get them once today i went through the drivethru which is an accident waiting to happen  there was lots of paint scrapings on the side walls of the building and ordered a plain bagel nothing more  just one plain bagel i got it home and discovered id been given a poppyseed i can appreciate a good bagel and einstein does in fact have them its just the other incompetence that bothers me  especially when its not isolated to just one or two instances the workers seem cheerful enough just wish theyd actually listen to whats being ordered instead of worrying about rushing to the next one in lineits a really lovely bar the food was good but in no way was that burger worth 18 for 18 dollars it should be the most amazing burger in philly it should reach up and slap me in the face i stick by the royal tavern burger hands downservice was veryvery slow considering it is an order at the counter place i got the salted caramel donut which was good but not great the donut was a little heavy i also orderd the cinnamon roll which i did not care for it came swimming in gooey icing and was soooo overly sweet that you almost couldn t taste the cinnamon plus they had sprinkled sugar on top of the roll too  sometimes balance of flavors is more important than just throwing everything in if they had free wifi i couldnt find itwe have been coming to this location since they open but it is slowly going down hill the people that work the register dont know the products there is always a problem with their drink machines even though i usually order the same item it never comes out the same this sad because there was a lot of hope for this businessthey babysit you at the yogurt i hate that i came with my husband and mother who is in her mid sixties if you would think of people to cause a ruckus two fat people and a geriatric are not it they continued babysitting after my mother got her cup the flavors were either too over powering or too bland when compared to other yogurt places  if the yogurt was better and i time traveled to high school maybe i would understand the babysitting there are too many other yogurt places you can go to that dont do thatwent here on recommendation to try the gnudi and i may not be taking recommendations from that person again they seemed to be pan seared smothered in butter and then served in a greasy oily mess gross  also trying to get my bartenders attention from him flirting with the female bartender  made my experience even worse when he finally would come over he acted annoyed that i was breaking up his little momentit pains me to write this review i love cfa but the service at this one on december 23 2016 at 136pm was terrible there was a line for drive thru which is typical and understood inside there was a line out the door with 1 person working the register for about a 10 minute period not the cfa i have come to loveordered the pizza to go was ready when promised but seems like they forgot the tomato sauce or something not up to the standards of other bjs ive been toothe wait was really long for our party  we made a reservation and still had to wait an additional 30 minutes  by the time we were seated they were out of brisket for the night  overall the bbq was mediocre and the service was about the samethe food is not good i was quite dissapointed  giving 2 stars as the customer service was really goodfood was excellent no sarcasm steak and shrimp tacos were both on point  however  do not sit upstairs service suffered immensely we literally had to walk downstairs to get our check after sitting and waiting 15 minutes to get our credit card back when we walked downstairs our waiter and two other employees were literally sitting on the stairwell w our receipts in hand just not coming up to finish our experience  oh and it must be noted that my wife found a sizable piece of saran wrap in her rice when mentioned we were comped with a free dessert a nice gesture but once again left us with no waiter for 15 minutes while we picked at it even though full   great food slow service plastic wrap the endas others have mentioned  insanely priced but friendly almost never a line and in the neighborhood also they have pretty decent hours youll never really find a deal here but for oneoff shopping they do the trickso overall the food is okay but i have major issues with precooked burgers  fries at a burger restaurant  for 10 each burger and around 5 for fries it should be cooked to order not made to order i watched the kitchen cook   fill large bowls of fries and leave them under a heat light while expeditors used tongs and place them on plates and out if the kitchen same for many of the burgersthey were precooked and warmed on the grill with their respective toppings when my food arrived it was room temp at best they have potential to be good burgers but please dont give me fast food at restaurant pricing i was disappointed with baileys this go aroundits still quite difficult to find a restaurant that has gluten free bagels andor bread however fillabagel does  i was so excited about it i didnt even mind shelling out 300 just for the frozen then microwaved semi faux bagel the very sweet girl who took our order cecilia was great we ordered 1 bagel with a schmear of smoked salmon salad and one gluten free bagel we asked 3 things 1 how was the frozen gf bagel prepared told microwaved then toasted 2 can we get the cream cheese  schmear on the side told yes 3how much of the spreads would you get if on the side enough to share  cecilia went and asked someone how much salmon schmear we would get she held up two approx 2 oz each plastic containers  that with 2 small coffees and a tip it came to 16 what we got was 2 bagels the regular one toasted the gluten free microwaved only and 2 partially filled 2 oz containers one with cream cheese one with salmon schmear i immediately told the nice woman who handed it to me that we were told we were to get 2 containers of each that the girl who took our order specifically asked the person who prepares the sandwiches then this other woman had to check with someone who had to check with someone elsea very grumpy someone else then they all had to discuss it all the while my microwaved untoasted 300 bagel was turning into a tiny rubber like disc thats what happens if you nuke a gf bagel and dont eat it immediately if someone internally told another employee wrong info deal with it behind the scenes and dont make the customer wait for you all to figure out where your miscommunication happened finally the very grumpy woman kelly leaves 2 more 2 oz containers even less filled with schmear at the pick up counter and says nothing no sorry for the wait no here you go not even heres your st  just a pissed off face and lousy attitude if you hate your job that much and despise dealing with the public who was just looking to get what they were told they were getting dont work there leave your bad attitude at the door it may only be about a bagel place but it seems anymore noone cares if they do their job well if i had that type of attitude i would be fired if you are in a customer service type job service your customers happily make them feel comfortable and welcome and want to come back especially in a little neighborhood business i have business right in that area relatively often lately and would have made it a go to place but now not so sure to go grab a bagel and coffee should be a really relaxed thing this was far from it i am probably one of the biggest fans of sonic out there but sadly i have to give this one very poor reviews i normally order a ton of items here but at this place i ordered just one item and they couldnt seem to process my order  so it took five minutes to order one item im not even kidding and then inexplicably it took quite a while to get my item and then the item with a different size that i had requested im sure some people have good experiences here but this is a synopsis of my quick less than pleasant stopthis particular location gives me the willies the last time i went into this store i heard the following quote from the cashier at the photo department shit im going to have to ring you up in the front because this register decided to be a tard    then as i was shopping for odds and ends i noticed a man following me around the store while comparing prices on deodorant i saw him at the end of the aisle crouching down in a squat and staring at me after making my purchases i was fiddling with my bike lock at their inefficient bike rack small semi circles 6 in height stuck into the concrete for several minutes seriously how am i supposed to wrapunwrap a ulock around my bike and into that mess finally as i unlocked and mounted my bike i saw the man standing directly in front of me behind the window still staring at me  i give them one star for being a pharmacy that usually has the items i need i give them another star for providing me with weird encounters to share with the interneti was really disappointed by my visit here the donuts were very thick and rubbery like they had been sitting out for many hours i tried 3 different flavors and none of them were particularly enjoyablei got an everything bagel with jalapeo cream cheese it was good but they got our order completely wrong only to realize it when we got home need to work on that its the worst when you get home and your order js wrongvery watered down version of asian cuisine these are the owners of the original sk noodle in sparks it sucked when they were there but luckily for them they didnt have any competition close by now the tides have changed and less than a mile away you have golden flower and pho 777 i went to sf kitchen once and i told the owners they needed to step up their food game cause crappy fails when you have the option of excellent avoid sf kitchenthis place is confusing it has two separate dining areas seperated by a half wall when we walked in we were asked what we were going to order because that would dictate where we could sit   apparently there are two owners that share a space but serve different items the waitress did not know what drinks they offered or really anything about the menus i got the sushi burrito and my husband got the pad thai the sushi burrito was awful i overheard the table behind us say the same thing the pad thai was good though we would not eat here againnot impressed the drive thru experience was difficult i had to repeat the order numerous times i felt it was overpriced 2 burgers and a order of fries for over 13 dollars the burger was not nearly as good as its competitors however the fries were ok my curiosity is over i will not be backthe reason i give more than one star is that at least i can grab an upland wheat on tap otherwise my experiences here consistently fail  i was a regular at the bloomington upland when i was at iu and i rejoiced when i found out about this taproom upon my relocation to the indycarmel area  the rejoicing ended once i ordered food and felt the atmosphere the food is inconsistently average the atmosphere is not welcoming it is not the home i knew and loved at the bloomington upland i voiced this once to the manager on duty and he quickly shut down my opinion this is not bloomington he said but this is upland my experience did not match my expectation of the brand i had come to love   i am compelled to write this review now that i find out that samples are 1 each if you want me to become a fan of your beer you should at least be willing to invest in shelling out 5 oz of the stuff to develop loyalty   i am saddened to write this as every so often i try giving this place a chance in the hopes that my views will change maybe next time i come ill enjoy it a bit morei came here with a group of 8 the other day for lunch and i was disappointed  first of all it took over 45 minutes to get our food i fully understand there were a lot of us but the restaurant was practically empty as it was barely noon in the meantime we got an appetizer of salsa queso and guac the chips were really light and crispy and the guac and salsa were fresh but the queso was straight up out of a jar and microwaved  i ordered shrimp enchiladas and they were kind of foul the shrimp looked barely cooked and had a rubbery texture the sauce tasted like it was right from the can and the dominant flavor was salt the rice was somehow undercooked so that there were little hard pebbly bits throughout the side of black beans was decent so i mostly ate that   the rest of my group said the food was fine though the overarching complaint was lack of flavor between the unimpressive food and the tacky decor i have no desire to returnok food bad attitude  sat here for 20 mins and didnt even know who our server was no one even came to ask if we need water the restaurant was only half full at the time came in for a bloody mary  i asked if they make good ones and the waitress said yes  all they did was use the liquor store mixer and added vodka it was pretty gross  we didnt get coasters with our glasses and it didnt seem like the people at the bar really knew what they are doing  i checked in on yelp and got a promo that said with checkin free dessert i showed this to the bartender and she had no clue what i was talking about she said she will ask and never did i never got my dessert  i didnt try any food but hope the kitchen is better than the bar service wasnt that great and neither were the drinksstep right up folks what mysteries what wonders lie within this glassfronted grocerarium youve gawked the bearded lady you yawned as the swordswallower downed a flaming bayonet but ladies and gentleman let me assure you  you have never seen anything like this here in our fair city mere blocks from our humble abodes there dwells a spectacle of most mindshattering magnitude its the worlds most expensive grocery store  you heard it here first folks you want carrots lasagna noodles a block of feta youll find all these things and more at prices so high youll feel dizzy just reading them marvel at the 6 crackers gasp gaze at  singularly unappealing prepared foods no and dont even ask what they charge for method dish soap ill bet you thought whole foods was rather pricey  my dear friends take it from me youve never seen anything like thislarge selection of beer  if you find a good one youll pay for it  this place is pretty expensive  the worst part is that it is not efficient  you go to the coolers to try and find what beer you want but you cant really look because the space is so small that everyone else is asking you to move so they can get in there too  also the line tends to wrap from the cashier directly in front of the coolersso youve got a small space as it is then a line then all those still trying to browse  i found it annoying overallfood good price high atmosphere quaint flies flying on food service good accommodating very poor had our two kids and they were not that hungry asked if we could purchase kids meals and pay for separate drinks in todays health driven society you would think forcing someone to order what they cant eat would not be acceptable not here had to pay for everything separately and were price gouged for every item most of the food wound up as wasted side items you wouldnt normally take home all in all it was good but not going back unless they change their policies yea rightcame into today with my boyfriend and ordered an iced cinnamon almond milk macchiato caramel nonfat frappuccino  a venti blonde roast with a shot of espresso they messed up all 3 drinks and our sandwiches came out burnt after waiting for 20 minutes after orderingafter being seated we were soon greeted by our server who said he would be right back  a few minutes later another server showed up and said she would be taking care of us  in the middle of her greeting the first guy came back and told her right in front of us that is was his table after a few awkward words back and forth they agreed she would serve us  were 10 minutes in at this point  ordered drinks10 minutes later were told that the diet cola was out so my wife ordered something else  20 minutes in and we finally ordered lunch 35 minutes from walking through the door we had food   it was just ok  ive had better at places that dont specialize in burgers  the fries and chips were nothing special either   it probably took 15 minutes to get a check and process payment once we were done    there you have it  an hour out of my life for an average overpriced burger  server was nice and i tipped her well but overall execution was very poor  i didnt spot a manager on the floor or i would have provided the same feedback   and that we make our own soda thing is dumb  go ahead and make your own but have other commercial options availabletastes like mcdonalds but this place is soooo slow i often have to repeat myself when placing and order as wellwas hungry for sushi last night and wanted to order online  the online menu is as busy and as confusing as the menus they have in the restaurant its doesnt even look attractive  needs to be done over i gave up and went to kroger  its much easieri dont understand how this place has so many stars i just had the most disgusting meal of my entire life i ordered the beef gyro platter  a strawberry banana smoothie for delivery  the platter had hummus  a greek salad with it  the gyro wasnt even on the pita the pita came on the side  i could barely chew the pita and it was as tough as cardboard if not tougher  the hummus was half water and the salad was horrendous  the dressing had my eyes squinting and the lettuce tasted very old  the rice was good but thats about itmediocre food service at hostess station needs lots of improvement layout of restaurant is terrible not impressed by servers training needed in food servicegood smoothie but the service is real rough we waited 20 minutes for three smoothies  in the end they made the wrong ones other folks waiting were also very frustratedbeef is very average pork is better but still not great  is high given the food  atmosphere not for menothing special really   this place is around the corner from my apartment and ive wanted to try it for a while i ordered 10 medium wings i chose to pickup so i sat inside and waited it was a reasonable wait   about 10 minutes go by and they announce that 10 mild wings are ready i continue to wait they give the order to another customer and then she turns to me and says i think this is your order because i should have more wings than this she returns the wings to them there was then some bickering behind the counter and then someone turns to me and says this is your order i stated 10 medium wings and they assured me oooo yes 10 medium wings  they were no where near medium there was barely any sauce on them at all it was all in the bottom of the container   i doubt ill go backso let me preface my review by saying this isnt set in stone and it could go up after i sample other items also i realize with its opening it has a lot of community support and i love seeing local family businesses thrive therefore i must be honest in hopes that they can get even better  i had a peach cobbler cupcake the whipped cream was very good the cake light not too sweet in light of the sweetness of the fruit good call but the base was not executed well considering the deliverya cupcake it was very gooey maybe caramelized but just hard to eat out of the paper and i guess the thing that was most disappointing was its 3 price tag maybe im not a big cupcake buyer but that just seemed high for such a tiny dessert  unfortunately the coffee lacks in flavor as well it was very weak and lacking any richness  again im all about second chances and hope to try another menu item again soonthis tims drive thru has a reputation of cutting you off and rushing you through to the point thats its rude its happened multiple times to neighbors friends and my husband and myself there are few times i would have ordered more but was cut mid order  and today was the first time in three months it was not rushed so i have a two star now instead of one stari have always enjoyed raising canes and the customer service i received so you can image my excitement when i found out one was opening in noco st louis  unfortunately the customer service ive received from the lindbergh location has been less than desirable  i ordered food today and found that there was a missing item when i reached home i quickly returned with my food and receipt and was met with an immediate attitude there was no apology just an annoyed stare after providing me with my food there will soon be a chic fil la in our area guess that will be my new fav if this is what i can expect from raising canesthis place was quite large but it wasnt that great for the location it may been decent and an easy place to shop for the odds and ends of an oriental cuisine that average american shops dont have but they are priced higher than most other city asian shops on most of their products selection of fish meat and obviously perishable inventory seemed large things that arent as obviously perishable seemed that they may have been sitting on the shelf longer than perhaps fdaallowed overall it was just an experiencewe ate there last night the food was great but our waiter was terrible and rude id love to give this restaurant a higher score but the service from the waiter specifically was so bad it left us shaking our heads it really doesnt matter how good the food at a restaurant is if the wait staff makes you never want to returnthis place takes forever to serve mediocre japanese fare and pretty terrible sushi and bombards you with japanese techno music at an unusually loud level for a restaurant its pretty damn expensive and the service is awful definitely not worth the huge amount of time and relatively large sum of money you will drop id go with samurai or tenno insteadthis concerns breakfast only the much bragged about popovers are a joke theyre exactly what i would make at home with the williamssonoma recipe at home they wont cost a ridiculous amount of money or time and i wouldnt have to deal with all the pretentious nonsense multiple flavors of butter polluting the air of this place   the butter out of my fridge would taste fresh too   coffee was ok but not worth the wait or the cost or the annoying atmosphere with the gigantic tvs blaring away some news talk show   ill rewrite this review if i ever get in on a different context but downtown badly needs a really good quick breakfast option and this sure aint itid love to feel better about coming for a meal someday because we hear good things about the food but i cant get out of my head my first experience going in there a year or 2 ago  i simply came in to locate a menu to either look at or to take home  i looked around to locate the menu and saw 56 pretty female employees standing over to my left  they were not far from me  they continued to talk during this time  not one of them looked up at me and no one from there or anywhere came forward to welcome me or ask what they could do for me or if i would be eating  i felt uncomfortable  it was not crowded  is this an overly picky criticism   i really dont think so  to me it spoke in volumes a non customer service attitude thank you for reading this commenti always drove out of my way to eat at this location last 2 times the quality of the food is poor the trash cans were running over and the employees were chatting at a table  seemed bothered when customers arrived were done with this qdobadefinitely a locals place its not in the safest feeling area entrance out back with limited lighting would recommend a serious update to the place we bowled so that was still accomplishedi wanted to like this place but it wasnt anything special and kind of greasy glad i got there at a time where we were able to walk right in and get a table without a wait i would have been upset if i had waited in a long line i didnt have pancakes though because they dont have a gluten free optionnot much to be impressed with here  my burger was overcooked and lacked flavor not sue what all the hype is aboutwe used to go here weekly last time i ordered takeout there was a loooong hair in my roll it grossed me and i havent been back sincecame here as part of a tour we were suppose to go next door to hermitage house smorgasbord however the food looked unappetizing so we walked next door to jiab my friend texted the number on the door to get a free curly fries we ordered junior bacon cheeseburger and a 10 piece chicken nuggets which came out to 4 hard to believe being that im from nyc we were one of few people in the restaurant at the time and the woman behind the counter was friendly even giving us two free drinks it is a fast food place so food was average for me however i do like mcdonalds and wendys chicken nuggets better but i guess i am bias glad this place was next door to save us from the food at herimtage house which according to people who went there for the tour said was grosswriten june 2011 oh the food truck a staple in some cities a midnight dream walking from the taverns pubs and cocktail bars alike everyone loves the smells and enticements of a great food truck i have heard rumors that west coast taco was one of these great food trucks best tacos in town they would say i find the best way to test the theory of the quality of the food truck is to do so sober the drunken palate cannot be trusted so i found myself walking across from the indianapolis capitol building and there it was a tall black truck with a group of people waiting around it i thought to myself this is a good sign a line is always good there where people suited up people in shorts and jeans a nice group i look to the menu and ask the young lady for the burrito with pork and a taco of course i waited for my reasonably priced meal that was handed to me in a reasonable time i walked a bit found a nice shady bench and took a bite expectations set high and was let down this wasnt the greatest taco not even close the burrito included the rice seemed over cooked and nothing special the meat was fine but again nothing to write home about but enough to warn you about  if you are drunk bombed smashed or even a bit tipsy these maybe the tacos for you but they are not for me food trucks these days are seen as restaurants on wheels gourmet pirates that travel the asphalts of our cities serving its citizens delicious goodness of whatever niche they are driving at there are a number of food trucks in indianapolis now i have been to three of them and tasted what they have told me was their signature grub and have been disappointed food trucks are coming to indianapolis and i have high expectations every time you hear of these food trucks they are suppose to be the best ever and i am waiting for the best to come to indy because they are not here yetive passed this place a few times and wanted to give it a try with my girlfriend we went in for the first time last night and it wasehgood heres my big 5 breakdown  customer service  the entire staff or at least everyone i noticed or encountered didnt seem to be a day over 20 years old which unfortunately correlated to inexperience and slightly poor professionalism the hostess was confused and gave the classic line im new here the waiter kind and helpful disappeared after our meal was delivered and im convinced she forgot us altogether until briefly passing by with our bewildered look with my payment in hand we had been waiting a while closing note we counted 4 different people approached our table within the hour offering to take perceived finished plates or refills in which i had to repeat no thank you im still working on that my thought leave us alone so we can enjoy the meal   food quality  it was good not great or offering anything out of the ordinary its a burger bar that i applaud for the fun beer paring and housemade carbonated sodas aside from the beverage uniqueness its not pulling ahead from the competition ill get to the better competition in my price criteriakeep reading  atmosphere this gets my most positive critique the place is colorfully vibrant with lovely murals and pictures on the walls theres a retro miniature train set chugging around the restaurant on tracks suspended above which allows for a fun familyoriented experience as well matched with the fun housemade sodas including green apple and dark cherry with the local craft beer for the adults its a wellrounded familyinclusive atmosphere  cleanliness not much to say here its clean and well maintained and that includes the bathrooms well done   price this is their downfall in my opinion its a little pricey for what were speaking in reference to burgers last night 3000 for two burgers two sodas and two small sides that includes the tip pricing points are not competitive for the quality you can receive elsewhere and by elsewhere im referring to boogie burger in bripp or bru burger downtown both easily comparable or better   overall im glad we can say we tried it probably a onestop experience in my booki said three times no egg on my breakfast sandwich did they listen nope   this place is good if you need something with wifi and for other meals but im giving two stars since i didnt feel like i was taken seriously this morning i will be going elsewhere next time i need a quick grabandgo breakfastprecinct pizza is a standard subpar pizza joint serving up new york style pies the inside is decorated with a large amount of new york memorabilia it can get fairly cramped when crowded but there were a lot of families with kids enjoying themselves most of the food options are not for the health conscious they have a wide variety of specialty pizzas with 3 or 4 different types available as slices on any given day the cheese was better than fast food chain pizza but thats about all i can say the bbq chicken pizza was average as well with a subpar bbq sauce i also had some of a chicken roll with bacon and tomato the dough was cooked well but the inside was salty salty salty with small bits of chicken and crumbled up bacon the marinara sauce was also salty but went well with the roll  overall better than dominos if you want pizza and good for the whole family but if you want better pizza you can find it elsewheredont waste your precious time or money the service wasnt completely terrible but definitely could have been better we saw our waitress 3 times and had to flag her down for all my friend and i both ordered lemonade whoever made the lemonade definitely forgot the sugar we did get refills and they tasted a lot better fried pickles were disgusting and soggy i didnt know it was possible to make a bad fried pickle macaroni and cheese had no flavor i ordered the popper burger which also had no flavor and over cooked dont believe the hype they also have a really long table that that make you sit at with other people with no personal space at all we could barely here ourselves talking my friend and i asked to be seated at single table on the upper level which wasnt a problem but seriously dont waste your money you will thank me lateri came here once with a friend with the intention of using a dealyo voucher i purchased was disappointed when i was told i couldnt redeem because i hadnt it printed out i was visiting from nyc so embarrassing ok so a few months later came back with printed voucher in hand i have to say this place probably needs to close down and regroup for so many reasons the decor needs up dating to start for what your paying for the food it needs to be more visually appealing in this place looks plain old  and plastic cups come on now to the food the real reason im here nothing special rather below average i had a seafood combo thingy nothing tasted fresh it was like it was left over from the day before so disappointed was so embarrassed i brought someone with me this place needs to get it togetheri never thought you could screw up a dunkin donutsand then i went to this location always out of everything latte machine is always broken and service is slowthe cookies are wonderful the service is so terribleits laughable this location is still open on my in house to go order i asked for a lentil bowl with egg asked about it 3x and 6 reg sizes cookies and 2 of each chipper cookies i was charged for but not given any of the chipper cookies no one greeted me i was in there and no one cared to pay attention to my order nor be looking to even see me standing at either counter i left 4 cookies short with my lentil bowl leaking out of the bag because no one cares to actually put the lid on a soup came home with soup in my car missing cookies and feeling taken advantage of knit wit teens working there couldnt care less please train and test your employees i would have had better service from toddlersit is offensively bad staff product service hereive been curious to try mad mex since it opened in its wynnewood location a few weeks ago since id heard mixed reviews about their other locations i went for a friends birthday celebration and i wish i could say i had a better experience but things just went from bad to worse  we put our name in when we arrived and were waiting at the bar for our table for quite a while maybe 30 minutes when someone went to check to see how much longer it would be and they had crossed our name off the wait list which made absolutely no sense they said it would be about ten more minutes until a table opened for the 8 of us meanwhile two people in our party ordered their food at the bar since they were in a bit of a rush  soon after we were seated after ordering it took a while to get our food but when we did i didnt notice the waitress coming around the table and was looking in the other direction when suddenly i leaned forward a bit and bang the waitress had knocked a couple of the big heavy plates she was serving right into my tooth and my wrist she must have been placing them down with a lot of force because she came pretty hard against my tooth and wrist enough to leave my wrist really red and bruised and my tooth sore so granted this was an accident and the waitress was very apologetic about the incident part of me definitely expected her to at least offer me a free meal which in my opinion would have been the professional way of handling the situation not only did that not happen but when she handed us one big check and we politely asked her if she could split it into individual checks she insisted that she was very busy and we just write down what we all had on the bill after this was taking way too long we decided to just ask again and she did it but was obviously not happy about it  and on top of all that the food i thought was just mediocre i had chicken fajitas which came with a lot of toppings but the seasoning on the chicken was lacking flavor and had too intense of a lime flavor which in my mind the seasoning makes or breaks chicken fajitas i also didnt care for the guacamole that came on the side it was also very limey without much other flavor the flour tortillas were good though  id say one other positive in this experience was the ambiance of the restaurant it seems like this place is one of those restaurants youd go more for the ambiance and margaritas rather than the food  one last thingthe two others in our party who ended up sitting at the bar to eat their meals said that it took 30 minutes just for them to get their check so they couldnt even join us after theyd finisheddespite never purchasing anything from say cheese myself i had half of my friends grilled cheese and was pleased but not blown away yet what really turned me off from this truck was being interrogated by one of the owners on why i actively visit other neighboring trucks street food farm truck as opposed to buying from them i said i was lactose intolerant which i am mildly and he rolled his eyes mockingly replying with yeaaah okay im not sure if this was meant to be a pick up line or what but it certainly deterred me from ever coming backim going to give castrillos two stars because it was underwhelming to me  but it was not bad  i stopped in for a slice because its really the only place that ive seen that offers slices  having moved here from nyc about 8 months ago my eyes lit up at the prospect of getting a slice  well it was a bit disappointing to find out that they only serve slices between the hours of 11am1pm    weird so finally i remember the time properly and was able to stop in for a slice  at first glance  ewwthe slice of cheese pizza looks like a big pillow strike 1  slices should be on thin crust and not oooozing with cheese  thats just not necessary  then i take a bite and i am pleasantly surprised that the sauce is actually pretty good  so im thinking i would entertain the idea of possibly ordering a pie for delivery one day and make sure that i ask for thin crust light on the cheese   i really just dont understand why people think its necessary to pile on the cheese  that is just not what makes a good pizza slice  its all about having the perfect balance between sauce and cheese and perfectly baked of coursewe shall see how round 2 goes  whenever that may bethis is my everyday dunkin but the past 3 weeks ive been getting burnt iced coffee if i wasnt on my way to work id go back and complain one more time and ill try a different dunkini went in to order a takeout dinner but the host  owner not sure was too busy on the phone speaking with her cell phone provider took her 510 minutes before she decided to try and multitask by taking my order    the food was ok but the service is awful fun to look for bargains prices have escalated since i began shopping here occasionally i think their prices are now equivalent to any other grocery store except acme giant etc doesnt sell outdated merchandise food they sell fresh foodthis place has really gone down hill over the past year they are randomly closed during normal business hours so its a hit or miss if you can actually go in and get yogurt my son  i were in a hurry today and got county vanilla and milk chocolate we should have taken the sweet lady working up on a sample bc it would have saved me moneythey were both disgusting so bad i throw them both away after a couple of bits disappointing because it used to be such a cute placethis review is for the bar only bar tenders were not friendly at all drinks were ok my main issue was how dirty the bar area was it is also a tight spacewe got a growler here and the lady charged us the full price but only filled it halfway will not come back as they short pour the glasses as welltjs needs to enforce the service animal rules or post a sign that reflects their practice of allowing animals in their market  i am a dog person  but i dont allow my pets to eat off the dinner table  this store has open produce and meat  if they want to be a pets mart and allow animals please sign your store with a warning for those of us who have no idea about the hygiene of these petsthis place made me sad because i think their beer choices are excellent but boy were they having a bad night when i took the time to try their food their tenderloin was completely flavorless the salmon tacos were a sad piece of overcooked dry salmon on top of a tortilla with virtually nothing to bring it flavor or moisture the burger that was ordered medium well was delivered closer to a hockey puck  our server never took our dishes away until she put down the bill despite us stacking them and putting them at the edge of our table  when i did pay the 32 bill in cash with a 50 sticking out she asked if i needed change  major pet peeve  my tip is stick to the beer at the baroverrated for a bbq place the portion sizes are crazy small i got the messy pig which is essential coleslaw with a half an ounce of pulled pork   there are better places in tampai went in there about 2 weeks ago for sandwich and a drink i use to always get  i went through the dt which i always do because i have no time for lines inside lady on speaker super nice and upbeat never said anything about being out of a ingredient that for me makes the drink and maybe silly to others but if i am going to spend 8 bucks its not petty for me i waited 6 or 7 minutes just to make it to the window which was more than fine i know what i am getting myself into when i go here got to the window and she took my payment than told me my drink could not be made with strawberries and said but that is okay does not matter i looked at her and said to me it does because it makes my drink and i use the strawberries in water after i finish my refresher she said well we do not have it so you can just drink it without i asked for a refund and she did so but she was not willing to come up with another option she was just rude and snappy because she assumed someone paying almost an hours of work for coffee would be fine with missing what is her favorite part of the drink is not sure what her name is and honestly does not matter she wants to be sour she has to live with her self just make sure you ask if they have what is needed for the refreshers if you are like me and its the best part of your drinkdont believe the hype  ok i have tried these donuts four times these simply are not good donuts the people who own and work at strange donuts are nice creative and hardworking folk but their donuts do not taste good im judging this based on all of their sweet donuts the gooey butter donut had a very gritty topping the cake style donuts are too dense and dry the fritter was the best but i wouldnt eat it again i wont be returning because the donuts are not deliciousthey use to be great there  and the staff was too  now they jokers and the manager there doesnt seem to be there now   my fiance and me use to eat there all the time but now we avoid itthis could be a 1 star review but the food was in fact good  starting with the positives of the food the many options of beef bison elk and boar and some vegan options were fun to look through and left our table of 3 with one black bean one elk and one boar burger we split up the 2 meat burgers to share between the carnivores  the food was excellent the large order of fries for the table and not as individual sides were plenty for us to share and the sauces were very tasty the side of spicy pickles however were disappointingly not spicy there was a hint of horseradish but that was it  the portions of the burgers themselves were quite small and left me feeling kind of hungry after including the fires also the black bean burger did not impress the vegan in our group he decided to have the burger in a collard leaf to be glutenfree but i feel like this just eliminates the whole idea of it being a burger  service was also underwhelming as the staff wasnt particularly attentive say with the water and making sure the orders were fulfilled  we had to ask about a side that didnt come at first also our party of 3 was seated at one of the booths which didnt seem to be designed for more than 2 one on each side i ended up feeling a little like i was sitting on the edge  discounts for jeff id holders was nice but everything seemed overpriced which we attributed to the whole organic only thing but even counting that we felt the burger portions were too small and the overall total was too high for still feeling hungry afterwards  sadly i will not likely go again  note we went for lunch on a weekendbeen three times now and while the decor sodas and service are great the food underwhelms and disappoints its restaurant 101 that appetizers not be served alongside entrees and still br does good fries and dips everything else pales with poor execution im afraidi loved everything i had heard about h  w before visiting this location  lower prices fresh produce and a local business  unfortunately i was unimpressed and disappointed with my visit  the store was small and felt run down and dirty  there were pieces of squished fruits and vegetables all over the floor and herds of kids and adults bumping into me and my cart as i tried to shop    the prices are somewhat lower than a normal grocery store but i found nothing exceptional in terms of freshness  the avocados and tomatoes were so underripe i had to go to safeway after to finish my shopping and items that i had been hoping would be of better qualityfreshness than a grocery store ie green beans red peppers were just as sad and uninspiring as anything at sobeys or safeway    when ringing up my purchases the cashier keyed in at least three of my items incorrectly perhaps more while i was getting my wallet and bags out  given that h  w is an extra 10 minute drive from home the produce wasnt anything special and that i couldnt wait to escape the crowded cramped aisles i wont be back  the experience wasnt worth the few dollars savingsi was really excited about going to cyranos and ended up very disappointed  my friends and i were seated in front of a door with wait staff constantly walking by us but not acknowledging us  we were seated for 30 minutes before i was able to flag down someone to ask whom our waiter would be  the service throughout the evening was lackluster at best  the food was good but it came from sugarfire so i cant even give cyranos kuddos for that  for dessert i ordered the bread pudding it took 22 minutes from the time that we ordered dessert for it to hit the table and it was cold upon arrival  needless to say i will not be backcoffee is good but scone has too much sugar preservative or something that makes the flour too much like a pastry starbucks please do not call it a scone this one even has frosting blechitalian disneyland as the only big italian market in town mazzaros has this action cornered and unfortunately they act like it big crowds big prices long wait times and sluggish service being from new york where they abound i have high standards for these specialty  markets quality wise mazzaros is mediocre at best definitely not worth the herald square sized crowds and madison avenue prices lack of competition is the only thing which accounts for their beatlemania like popularity on the plus side their bakery is quite respectable as well as their cheese shop as to the butcher deli wines and grocery far better choices abound in saint petersburg as a new yorker i pine for the days of balduccis on 6th ave or the quaint cheese shops of the east village while mazzaros smacks of something sentimental of these i always find myself entering their amusement park as homesick and leaving sicker still only with buyers remorse 40 for a frozen lasagna if youre lucky it wont fully thaw on the seat beside you while youre waiting to turn onto 22nd street its truly the magic kingdom of italian markets abracadabra your money just disappearedwhen we first noticed that the building that is now the village pub was being constructed into a new business my boyfriend and i were stoked when we found out that it was going to be a pub  beer garden we actually let out cheer our home happens to be less than a block away so the thought of crawling home from evenings filled with mischief and relaxation sounded swell   instead we avoid visiting this establishment due to crummy customer service strange policies and a lackluster menu  ouch  another reviewer mentioned that her 6 month old sleeping child was banned at 4pm due to a policy of not allowing anyone under 21 years old in the establishment i can understand wanting to take precautions from underage drinking but do people under 21 not eat as well you are really limiting your customer base if a family cant bring their supervised children for a meal we attempted to sit on the patio with our 5 pound wellbehaved  silent chihuahua for some drinks one afternoon the waitress rudely told us that no animals are allowed on the outside patio area and that we needed to take him home i can understand that every place has their own policies but again nashville is a very petfriendly city especially east nashville and to exclude people with wellbehaved pets from enjoying cocktails on your patio will turn off another demographic of people from supporting your business it should also be noted that she was rude in the delivery of her message and the service to follow wasnt up to par either  the menu was another issue as it was limited to basically meats cheeses breads and pretzels there werent any healthy or vegetarian options available either i have heard from others that the pretzels and cheeses are good i personally think that there should be more meal appropriate options instead of just snacks available it could mean that consumers would be more likely to stick around if they didnt have to plan to leave for dinner somewhere else  i can appreciate the fantastic job that was done in building out the village pub because it is quite comfy and cozy with a large wrap around porch the 24 ounce mugs of beer are also enjoyable because of the nice selection of microbrews and imports   however the alienation of various groups of people who could be loyal customers and the lack of service make jumping in the car and heading to another locale more likely tis a shameim really not a fan of the way the business is run  the hours are not posted and are completely unpredictable the last 4 out of 5 times ive gone midafternoon on a spring weekend theyve been closed and the staff members are quite variable in terms of quality of making the softserve and smoothies as well as in level of courtesy  while the softserve is pretty good with extra points for the large variety of flavors its about 2530 more expensive than the other frozen yogurt places in the area making it difficult to justify choosing it over other more consistent optionsbah whats up with this philly this was some inferior coffee maybe it was an off day but just because you have hipsters serving you coffee in gorgeous italian ceramic mugs doesnt mean its good  im sorry man but the espresso in my cappucino tasted so burnt it was not a very pleasant drink my so didnt even finish his espresso he disliked it so much  bahhhgreat place for the scene but dont go expecting amazing brewabsolutely not authentic food terrible tortillas that they dont even double up when they serve them as a taco when i had went on the facebook page to comment on a picture well they werent to happy that i was telling them that they over price their wrinky dink tacos i lived in the southside of chicago in pilsen before i moved here and anyone whos been there just drools thinking about tia luis or el milagro i was then told i could go to taco bell if i wanted a cheaper taco and then blocked me from ever commenting on anything of theirs on facebook   you cannot quite my reviews  anyways for a place trying to run a business its crazy that they are assuring us that they have mexicans cooking or being completely rude about suggestions   nothing will ever be as good as my pilsen southside mexican food from chicago at least they arent being bulldozed for a trader joes the service is extremely slow the bartender had no interest in serving a drink to me or a young lady also waiting at the bar instead she played with her computer for a few minutes while joking with the three regulars at the end of the bar afterward she served them each a refill and then prepared a drink and took it out on the casino floor i gave up then she did all of this while never even looking down in our direction even as she walked right by to take the drinks to the floorslowest starbucks drive thru in history i could have driven back home brewed a pot of coffee and packed a travel mug in the time it takes to get through their drive thru parking your car and heading inside is not any better either its unfortunate but its the only starbucks with a drive thru in the riverview areai have shopped at the tampa road store since the mideighties when the store grew and expanded i felt like it was due to the great service selection and quality that i  had always found consistently   unfortunately i wonder if the groupon and half off depot has led to their demise prices have gone up and stock is barely visible my last visit i only left with chicken that i was overcharged forthe ambiance is absolutely lovely especially sitting outside unfortunately the service is so exceptionally slow that it ruins the entire experience we have been here 4 times on various daystimes and never have we gotten our food faster than 15 hours after being seated the food is average at bestthe food at cafe olivia is really good the service is not  this is a business that cares more about pinching a penny than serving the customer  the owner runs the register while another man presumably owner as well barks orders at his workers and refuses to do anything extra even on request    once the owners daughter was working the register and i requested extra sauce she told the man running the pass however he refused to add the extra sauce i told her i was happy to pay for it  another instance i asked the owner for extra sauce on the side she was happy to charge me for the extra sauce but then insisted that it could not be put on the side the extra sauce would only have to go on the sandwhich     if you dont ask for anything extra or different you are in good shape and your experience will be fine but dont bother them by asking for a side of sauce it just cant be donemcdonalds what do you need to know   they serve the purpose id complain about the inaudible spanish fellow working the drive through but why would i expect much elsei think everytime i go here its a scam  everything is overpriced and everything is priced  its not like the small town farm where can go on a hayride and bring home a buy  i mean unless you want to go broke  there are other smaller farms around dont get me wrong its really nice but paying 1015 for a pie is insanefeels sort of like a private club everyone seems to know each other which is great if youre a regular ok food and drinks but i felt like i was at somebodys party in their housei came into this place with pretty high hopes we entered around lunch time and there was no one else in the shop i almost turned around to see if i had the right place this is the patisserie that everyone talks about right  on booming maple street so busy you cant find a parking spot right  ok so moving on i am welcomed with a case full of beautiful pastries a vast selection of them to boot  oh my eyes were in food porn heaven  not to mention the baker with his european accent that also lures you in this man has to make awesome stuff i mean listen to his accent  how could i possibly choose just one    there is a vast selection from scones fresh baked breads tarts eclairs croissants slices of cakes petit fours cannolis cinnamon rolls donuts i could go on forever its all there and it all looks amazing  well we didnt and decided on a few selections some fruit tarts an elcaire filled with vanilla cream a slice of red velvet and a croissant  it was all so beautiful and we couldnt wait to sink our teeth into the treats    the taste well that a something i wasnt expecting everything and i mean everything tasted funny  i couldnt believe it and was genuinely shocked  i wasnt the only one who said this  i dont know if it was that the case hadnt been cleaned out in awhile or what it was  it all tasted either like it had been frozen or been in the case looming with the other flavors for quite some time  it didnt taste fresh or like it should let me just say that     other than the funny taste that i couldnt define the cause of let me move on   the tarts were topped with slices of kiwi strawberry and mandarin the cream of the tart was smooth and rich not sweet the crust was good not great   red velvet was dense and moist  the icing is not the traditional cream cheese though its more of a whipped cream type   croissant was flaky and buttery  the eclair as it turned out to be let me explain we were a bit mislead by the young funky uptown girl behind the counter she said it was puffed pastry i asked what the filling was she said it is vanilla cream i asked if it was cream like cream puff cream she said yes  it wasnt it was an eclair with bavarian cream maybe i didnt speak patisserie well enough for her to translate what i was looking for    it was all fine enough except for the fact that everything had this odd taste to it everything  it made me very sad as i was really looking forward to a knock your socks off bakery experience based on what i heard about this place  the staff aka the girl behind the counter was not very helpful and she seemed a bit inconvenienced by us and my lack of being able to make choices within the timeframe she normally allots for customers even though we were the only ones in the shop   while we were there one of the baker men finished a chocolate cake for someone that looked amazing and he went to put it into the front counter cooler he pulled out a plastic container that had half a sandwich and a strawberry in it and asked the girl why it was in there she told a story about another person and the fact that she was saving the strawberry  hmm maybe this has something to do with the pastries tasting odd   i dont know    i might give them a second shot but i am sad to say i have had better pastries that tasted fresh from other local bakeries  pro tip dont approach the counter until you know exactly what you want here if you dont want to feel like the bad kid in class and about to be put in a patisserie time outbeen here multiple times and i generally enjoy the selection of yogurt and toppings however i have yet to have an enjoyable customer service experience every time i go the associate seems to be more invested in their phone than the people in the store or even cleaning the tablesreally underwhelming for a place that markets itself as health food it has about two vegetarian items on the menu i had to be creative with substitutions on meat items to make something worth paying money for i hate to write bad reviews  but this is the most overhyped place on yelp that ive seen in nola yetworkers are extremely rude and dont smile especially one of the creepy managers who walks around in the pm hours and asks to help you mockingly food selection isnt bad it is a small store but they have everything you will need however very very very expensive about 3x or 4x more than an average supermarket i know city supermarkets are going to be more expensive than suburban ones but this is much more expensive than the other city supermarkets you are better off going to food and friends at 20th and spruce superfresh at 10th and south or if you have a car wegmans in cherry hill overall rittenhouse market is basically awfulyech   side salad 350 looked like they got it out of a dumpster  watery bolognese sauce had no detectable signs of meat  meatball 3 was sawdust tasting  service was good but that is all  no italian was harmed or would walk near this joint in the preparation of this foodso i have the same order every time coconut milk tea with extra boba and thus i cant speak anything else keep that in mind this is only applicable for milk teas  tldr  is drink sweetness and customization a major factor for you go to chatime down the street they have much better service too  want a fast meh ontherunimdrivingonthissideofcampbell boba go to bings   want a drink and are super hungry too wtf get your tail to miss saigons already they haveedible boba if youre not a boba snob you wont notice  its really yummy but honestly any excuse to go to miss saigons is a good excuse  so bings isan okay boba it beats the lowerthanaverage quicklys locations in san francisco but thats not saying much  however though i truly love tucsons chatime bings is more consistent with their boba cookin chatime boba can be undercooked overcooked  who knows    boba should be al dente you hooligans al dente  yes chatime can do the i want it 314159 sweetness or whatever but i dont really give a shit about that i just give a shit about my al dente boba okayim okay  anyway bings advantage ends right there the service here sucks like consistently sucks you only interact with them for 20 seconds max but its the principle if you want to support businesses that care about customer service go to chatime down the street  their staff is awesome and though i harp on their nonal dente boba shenanigans its usually quite good and the actual drink itself always superior   i recommend chatime overallsurly service and 3 donuts smashed together  with no wax paper  in the bottom of the bag i wont make a point of going back the only reason im giving 2 stars is because they had a decent selection of donuts available at the time of my visitfood 25 service 25 value 2  did not live up to the hype in terms of quality pricey and strange little placethe saddest part of this review is that i used to like axis and frequent it all of the time but my last experience was telling in ordering a chicken finger platter i asked for a side caesar salad along with bbq sauce and honey mustard for the fingers when i get back to my office and open my meal i find that instead of the salad i received chicken noodle soup and instead of bbq sauce i received maple syrup whats even more annoying is that i paid extra for the bbq sauce when i call them and tell them of their mistakes they only offer to remake the salad i still had to travel back to the restaurant and exchange my food myself with no reimbursement for my time and inconvenience axis do betterwhile the staff is funny and nice the entire place is overrated the donuts are too expensive and they arent even that good the weekend donuts are hit or miss the chicken and waffle donut was really the only donut i felt worth the money and hype i love donuts but ill be going elsewherefood and drink is pretty good but the ordering and flow are very awkward and inconvenient heres the typical experience  1 stand in line to order from the main counter while you constantly dodge people leaving the restaurant or going to sit on the patio   2 if you ordered a drink you then go stand in line at the bar and compete with people that are sitting at the bar  people who are ordering their food directly at the bar because they didnt feel they needed to stand in the first line all this time you might be holding your silverware and nonalcoholic drinks and your table number sign and now youre dodging food runners and people filing up their drinks at the drink station   3 carry all your stuff to find a table while dodging everybody in the queues  mentioned in step 1 and line 2   if you want another drink repeat step 2  i was excited to hear that local taco had previously converted to table service but theyve already reverted back because people complained that service was too slow i think instead of reverting back to a bad system they shouldve focused on improving their table service model  just my two cents but i would rather see local taco be a place to go relax and pay someone to run around the place as opposed to being a chaotic version of chipotlewow i cant believe people have been giving this place 5star reviews not that thai tanic is bad its just not any good either ive never been bored at a thai restaurant before  i knew there was going to be trouble as soon as i saw the menu i didnt see a single originallooking dish many of the names had been changed from thai to english what is a thai taco it didnt look promising i should have stuck with that instinct  thai food is supposed to have subtle and complex flavors thai tanic didnt get the message my scallop dish tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and not much else the waitress brought a small bowl of red pepper saying the chef had forgotten to add it to the dish when he cooked it my wifes curry was equally unsubtle mostly coconut milk and not enough heat our son loved the pad thai but then hes only 2 years old the adults thought it was pretty awful  if you want to eat decent thai food skip this place and go to nadia or thai orchidhonestly i dont get the hype wait was incredibly long20 plus minutes for a bagel sandwich and the only compliment is that i can say at least it was food i get sometimes you wait for quality but that doesnt apply here do they deep fry the bacon it was crunchy and had a really awkward texture honestly it was gross the bagel itself was ok not terrible not great just ok ill say that the guy cooking on what looked like the worlds smallest griddle was non stop hustling which made the wait seem even stranger im gonna assume the call in orders take priority over customers that actually make the effort to visit the store last visit here for sureso disappointed  our waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu we had 2 adults and 3 small kids we asked him if 1 large fry would be enough for our family the boys had kids meals but it dod not say anything about coming with fries and he said probably not so we should order 2 large fries boy we we surprised when the kids meals came with fries and we were stuck with an additional 2 orders of large fries we also asked for our burgers done medium while the burgers were tasty they were extremely well donecharred our waiter didnt come by our table for 15 minutes so we couldnt take them back when i mentioned it to him his response was we have had lots of problemscomplaints with that in the kitchen there was no discount offered or the very least a new burger we will not be back as 80 is way too much money to spend for 2 burnt burgers 3 orders of chicken fingers  way too any fries and 2 beerswe want to love this place because when the food and service is good its great however after many times visiting they just arent ever able to get it right one day the service is fast the pancakes are cold and the waffle is gross the next time the food is good and you wait 45 minutes to get it if they could consistently get their service and food up to par on the same days this would be a solid 4 star breakfast option in indyextremely disappointed i bought their special harry potter red velvet cake with butterbeer frosting slice i wouldnt even call it a slice and they charged 10 for this i wish i wouldve taken a picture but after splitting it in half with my son i got a whole six small bites of cake the picture of the slice they showed on facebook is very deceiving its that height but cut like a piece of bread not cake and the cake itself was dry and i didnt really taste the butterbeer but the frosting was good we did also buy an oreo cookie covered with chocolate and a cake pop which we havent tried yet i really liked the theming they did for harry potter but i dont think ill be back too overpriced for what i gotstopped in tonight for a quick bite before a movie at the ritz and was thoroughly disappointed i got the mixed garden vegetable noodle bowl with vermicelli noodles and extra shrimp dumplings the broth was so mild it could have doubled as warm water i added soy sauce but the waterbroth was so flavorless the soy was powerless against it the vegetables were equally underseasoned like they were boiled in water and then served there was no flavor for the noodles to absorb is there no shoyu garlic ginger sesame oil etc in their kitchen i found myself thinking well the menu didnt specifically say there would be seasoning maybe i was wrong to assume they would add flavor my husband suggested that maybe someone in the kitchen mixed up water  broth either way i wont be back on a positive note the movie was excellent  i do highly recommend begin againjust left lee roy selmons  how disappointing  i got the baby back ribs which were dry and very toughwas here 2nd time food below average just boring nothing worth the money egg noodles simple green beans and tough pork with mushroom brown gravey my wife returned grizzly beef stroganoff got medium burger well done brought home to dog 3 aptz nothing great there was just no wow effect over all not worth 140this might just be the saddest liquor store i have entered to date  no baskets were in sight this left the following options either go back outside and grab a cart or cling on to your items and hope they dont drop because that would be costly and unfortunate  beyond the cartbasket situation maro brothers aka the old joe canals manages to have fairly terrible selection youll walk in to florescent lights and wines hanging out in carts rather than on shelves i didnt bother to browse the wine  i headed over to the beer section and they were severely lacking in the craft department but hey if youre looking for a case of rolling rock this is your place  just make sure you have id on you and ready to present for analysis ive never seen one store display so many signs about the fact that youre going to get carded like cool congrats youre following the law but how about investing in something other than signs  like say basketshas a nice environment and nice servers but when we were brought our waters i could notice little white specks in the water that looked like someone backwashed the water after eating something i asked for another water and yet again it had the white things in it after that we ordered our food and i ordered the caesar salad and french fries the fries are delicious and the salad was okay but could use more flavor as i was eating the salad i noticed a little piece of blue plastic which was probably from the toothpick they place in the sliders in my salad and that was unappetizing and to top it all off they forgot my order of fries the first time so again great environment and stuff just disappointing and grossed me outi really wanted the station to be my goto for not working at home but the noise levels in there can get really loud for those used to coffeeshops in the city its not conducive to work  think more family hangout and chatty meetandgreets as opposed to a place populated with laptops where you can get stuff done even with a pair of earbuds  as another reviewer also noted the music does intrude it included commercials the last time i was there and the menu is pretty basic if you want a place to hang out i think the station is great with what theyre doing for merchantville but as a place to get work done telecommuters look elsewhere  last ill say that my friends bands have played there a few times and there was a 10 cover charge in merchantvilleid been hearing about wct for about a year had seen their truck parked and tried a couple of times to buy some but it was just their parked truck no serving so i liked them on facebook so i could know in advance where they were going to be typically theyre in areas im not or at hours that im sleeping so i was forced to wait a while then they were going to be at butler u so my family took the stroll over the selection was minimal with 3 choices teriyaki chicken steak ori dont even remember something else the tacos were ok but nothing to write home about they sure couldve used a better brand of tortillas because these thin wimpy corn tortillas werent much better than waxed paper  overall i found them fine for truck food if youre drunk or if you have money to burn for a changeofpace lunch thats available right outside of your office however i didnt find them worth the trek or the money if youre wanting a good soft taco there are places on or around the 38th street corridor that improve on these considerablyi probably should have gotten the pancakes while at the pancake pantry but since it was later in the day i was really in the mood for lunch  i got a turkey bacon wrap and it was extremely sub par but i got the soup of the day with it also which was unreal  it was a white bean and ham soupwe tried the derby steeplechase pie and the pecan pie  papa c is in love with sugar and light corn syrup the pecan pie and derby steeplechase pie were overpoweringly sweet  the crust was crumbly rather than flaky  honestly my own derby pie is superior to papa cs  at 775 for a sixinch pie these are not a bargainatmosphere was pretty nice boba tea was sealed in plastic cups the servers were friendly and attentive  what i had issue with was the food itself i started out by trying the spicy basil chicken for 1285 the presentation was great in a stainless steel bowl but as i bit into my second piece i quickly realized each bitesized chunk was 65 bone making my chopsticks useless i attempted to eat it by hand but there were just too many little bits of bone hidden and i had to pick apart each piece to scavenge for where the meat was one of the pieces was literally a 1x1 piece of spine and ribs i asked if it was supposed to be served this way and the server said yes i told them the menu did not warn me of this and that if its the most expensive chicken item in the gourmet section prepared in bitesized chunks of meat covered in sauce it makes it very difficult to determine youre going to bit into a piece of meat or bone i couldnt finish it they agreed to give me halfoff  so i ordered something simple kung pao chicken they had it ready in less than a minute after she went back to the chef which drew my suspicion this time it was brought to me on a simple white plate it was a generous serving size for 9 and some change unfortunately the amount of salt was much too much the mixture was uneven so one bite might be perfectly fine while another bite was chock full of salt one piece of green bell pepper had so much on it i could actually taste the sandy granular texture of the salt crystals i felt like a cad but i couldnt finish it either i finished my boba tea and steamed rice without issue and paid 23 for my meal  to my surprise one of the cooks came out and i explained it briefly the word is there are two chefs a good one and a bad one the bad one is related to the owner so he cant be let go this explained things quickly to me it felt like a gordon ramsay moment  needless to say im still hungryafter reading review by friends and checking out the menu i was psyched to go and try the veggie burger and ice cream my sister and i decided to head downtown for lunch to check it out we always have a hard time deciding where to go but it was easy to decide this time  we walked in and asked to sit upstairs  we agree with erin that the communal table isnt our thing we immediately noticed that it was freezing both of us were wearing pants and fleeces since its a huge open space we knew asking for some heat wouldnt help our waitress came right away and got us waters i ordered the root beer on tap only to be told that there isnt any root beer on tap hm ok for such a new place with new menus that was surprising i hope they get it in the future there is a huge list of bottled sodas really interesting ones i didnt get one though decided to stick with water   i ordered the veggie burger with fries and the regular ketchup plus the creamy slaw i asked if the slaw had onions because i dont like them and they make me sick the waitress said she was pretty sure that it didnt but shed check our food came out very quickly the first thing i noticed was all the onions in the slaw the second was that the veggie burger patty looked very different from any ive seen the waitress told us it had beans nuts veggies but it was pretty plain looking no veggies apparent i scraped the slaw off the burger and took a bite the patty was mushy room temp and tasted like smashed beans with no seasoning and not even grilled i tried the fries they were good the ketchup was ok  but from the bottle wouldve been fine if you like a lot of sauce this can get pricey my sister and i each took another bite and just looked at each other gross it was not at all good in fact it was pretty inedible the waitress came by and we told her that we really didnt care for it that it didnt taste like anything but mashed pinto beans and wasnt warm she said shed get the manager we waited and waited and waited and waited no manager finally our waitress came back and said they were taking the burgers off our bill we were a little disappointed that the manager didnt come around we really wanted to give our feedback about the burger and give advice on how to improve as we want them to do well but vegetarians would not like this burger at all   i had some ice cream because i was pretty starving still and it was decent the mint tasted good but the chocolate chunks were huge and overwhelmed it and the cookie dough was creamy and good but there wasnt very much cookie dough in it  we walked out feeling disappointed i hope that the ownerchef see this and take that veggie burger off the menu it really brought the menu down rework it try some other places and give it some seasoning veggies and cook it and i might try it againnot a good experience when i went up to the sauce station to get the cilantro garlic sauce there was hair in it which completly made me lose my appetite when the serverfloor attendant came and dropped off my food i asked how he was doing and he said he was sick but fine not cool to have a sick person working especially around food lastly the chicken avocado wrap and fries he brought out to me were cold sucks that it was bad service because i work close to the location and its very convenient will not be returninghate to sound pessimistic but i ordered to creole catfish entre large instead of filets it came out looking like a childs meal tiny pieces of fish that was like bait  do not order this you will be disappointed for 1950everything i saw in print and in the media said grand opening  it was not grand  the place was asses and elbows and the manager said they werent ready for it  you are having a grand opening and youre not ready for it  for one thing there has been a signbanner up in the window that this place was coming for over a year at least  people saw the sign and they have been waiting  reviewers tend to like to give justopened establishments a break and say oh they just need to work out the kinks  ok here were the kinks 1  staff couldnt meet the demand  nothing worse than going somewhere to drink and youre standing there with empty glasses  they even took away our glasses and didnt ask us if we wanted another drink  we had to catch someone and ask if we could get another drink 2  they only had vodka and i believe wine  they didnt have any beer and i believe i was told it was because there was a problem with the coolers  they are supposed to have gin and rum but it wasnt yet available  they were also out of club soda for the mixed vodka drinks 3  the interior seemed unfinished  the concept is fantastic  theres so much potential with the chemistrymad science gimmick as far as decor props colors dry ice etc 4  probably the most important thing of all is that i did not like the vodka  i gave it the old college try  i tried it with cranberry i tried a moscow mule and i tried a french 76  it all came back to the vodka having an earthy dirty taste  its somewhat smooth as far as the alcohol bite but its not clean  to be fair my drinking partner liked it  she was not bothered by the taste i will go back as i would like to see if i like their rum is any better than their vodka and i would like to see if there is more to the place in time  it would also be nice to see if the bartenders are more personable when they can do more than be at the mercy of an unruly mob of craft cocktail seekerstook our kids there for lunch on a very slow saturday we switch table because our had ants all over it they were out of the soda we requested out of kid menus and out of mild salsa  reason was they were out of tomatoes even though they are in the same shopping center as a main grocery store we had to ask for sliver wear refills and the check we wont be back for awhile which is sad because the food was good and i do want to support the local business in our townatmosphere and food were great  service left much to be desired   i arrived early and solo   my entrance started with the hostess smiling then walking away she returned a few minutes later and immediately helped guest who entered after me   i decided to find my own way to the bar and was treated fairly well there although i did see an employee put their nose directly over a liquor bottle     i came to dine and socialize with a larger group and the staff was not as accommodating to our needs as anticipated   the expectation is that all attendees arrive at the same time which is hardly ever true with a large business group   we were at risk of losing a table but fortunately all we anticipated to arrive showed up  again the food and atmosphere were great  entry is everything and if people dont feel welcomed they may now return or recommend for that matterim giving another review as its been under new leadership for some time now for the last two years ive been getting my holiday parties catered from riverview fresh market and even pointed others their way for catering as well not anymore their food quality is inconsistent rice taste like its been made days in advance you can tell when rice been around awhile plantains are dry and fried pork is over cooked their inconsistencies with food quality made my family stop going and thats disheartening  since we would eat there at least once a week however their others products and groceries are reasonable in price and a variety of choices from produce canned foods other non perishable items meats hair products and more thats why they are getting 2 starsi like the ice cream at icesmile the only thing that i thought sucked was the fact that they advertise giving you a free ice cream on your bday bring your id they say i was there buying more than one ice cream on the day before my bday i asked if i could get my ice cream that day or next week bcuz i was having surgery on the day of my birthday and i would not be able to make it there id be in the hospital that was the fastest no ive ever seen a manager say boy was i dissatisfied kind of rude  not sure if i want to go back for a while or at allhad an ok dinner came in an hour before the place closed on a tuesday but might as well been ten mins past closing since the staff had already checked out   was odd to have server walk past me and ask if we were ok and not stop as she walked by   dirty plates stayed on table for a while and asked if we wanted the check while one person was still eating  no bueno   food was ok sides were cold and refills were non existent on drinks   have tried to eat here before now i know i didnt miss anythingeh not worth it wait was quoted at 20 minutes turned into 40 and then we sat in a table in the middle of the restaurant where people kept hitting my back while i walked by when i complained and asked for a booth they gave it to us but the hostess was very rude the food was eh good but overpriced you would do better at bobbys burger palaceooooh girl no   you know when you go shopping with a friend and they try on an illfittingugly shirt and they think its omgsocute and you just dont have the heart to tell them that its just not working for them you just want to shake them and tell them they could do so much better but instead you smile and tell them that they look great  actually im not that friend at all im brutally honest dont ask for my opinion unless you really want it but for the sake of this review lets pretend that i am   the island frozen yogurt is the equivalent of that ugly shirt that your friend is in love with  and honey ill let you in on a little secret you could do so much better   dont get me wrong the island is cute its an adorable tropicalthemed froyo shop in the heart of soulard and if you want to stay in the city its one of your only options   let me take a moment to not be a food snob and say that the island isnt that awful they have a pretty decent variety of flavors even though vanilla was one of the only ones i could choke down and yes i sampled every flavorfatty the service was fantastic the guy working the day i visited i want to squeeze him into my pocket and take him home with me and the price was reasonable   but back to the froyo itself it had a weird consistency almost icy its such a far cry from the sweet rich velvety delicious froyo that yogurtland or red mango or orange leaf serves remember the selfserve vanilla frozen yogurt that you gobbled down at old country buffet as a kid just me ooookay or the frozen yogurt at sweet tomatoes the frozen yogurt at the island is like that and hey if youre into that do yo thang i wont hate you go glen coco   butcan i tell you something you know just between me and you promise you wont get mad okay  that shirt looks like shit on youi went here once waited in the obligatory long line and founda regular run of the mill diner no frills pancakes were good but nothing special our waitress was incredibly slow the place was packed but dont they expect that and we had to wait forever for our check not worth the hypethe bacon egg and cheese breakfast bagel was very greasy  obviously the bacon would be but the bagel itself barely stayed in my hands price and flavorwise it was one of the more reasonable options at the airport though i had a side of grits it is new orleans after all and the cheese smelled so bad i almost threw up it literally smelled like bo i dont understand definitely do not recommend it after reading other reviews i decided not to get any of the cheesecake it looked good so it was tempting thoughi finally made it into the sweet taco never made it in to its predecessor taqueria del sol wish i had so that i could offer a comparison   however i stopped in for some tacos they were asiasi as they say in mexico just being soso is not good enough though for a place that specializes in tacos   we make better tacos here at home on our taco night to tell you the truth i had the chicken tacos there two kinds grilled and crispy grilled chicken was flavored pretty well but all it was was the chicken a little lettuce tomato and sour cream slapped into a little soft taco shell i could literally put in in the palm of my hand squeeze my hand shut and you wouldnt be able to tell that there was anything in my hand but thats how theyre supposed to be and theyre cheap so what do you want me i rather something more flavorful and substantial   the atmosphere was kind of cool lively the employees were awesome speaking of employees there were so many of them working for how little there was going on in there very nice employees though who cared about their job   the doughnuts didnt look appetizing at all i couldnt imagine wasting my caloric intake on one of those   the place just comes off as having an identity crisis part americas version of mexican food part bar and part bakery sometimes when you try to do everything you end up not being able to do any of them really well this place has plenty of potential if they were focused on mexican and were more authenticdoc bakers used to be one of my favorite places to stop and get lunch and a healthy shot previously the staff was warm and very informative today the staff was cold and appeared to be bickering about an order they were trying to fulfill on time the past four times ive gone they havent had any of the wraps i attempted to order nor could they make any wraps i will no longer be making the twenty minute drive to be disappointedgreat service rock crab over cooked  looked good  but  great soup and salad  bread good when u asked for itsat for an hr waiting for 2 slices of luke warm pizza and 3 philly cheese steaks that lacked meat and flavor wont be returningwe had high hopes for this place but we found the burgers just average here you can custom order your burgers with whatever you want on it i had a pretty standard burger with swiss lettuce ketchup mustard mayo and to add a bit of a twistroasted corn the buns were averagea little too big for my liking the taste of the burger was pretty good but again nothing too special not sure if well be back for a second round there are so many other better options out therethe food wasnt very good i have no idea why theres currently 45 stars the wings were the best but not great the greek food was way below average yelp rarely lets me down but it did this timemeh is right  ive been here a few times because i work nearby and ive never been blown out of the water by it  their springs rolls are ok a bit small and not cost comparable to other vietnamese restaurants  in fact all of their entrees are smaller portionsnot that this is necessarily a bad thing but im just used to take home portions with most of the asian cuisine around town  the prices are higher too  i was charged 20 for an order of egg rolls and one of their specials  thats crazy  ive had the lemongrass chicken bun and it comes with a wide assortment of veggiesmore than just the cucumber and carrots you may expect  that was nice but again the portions are small and higher priced than their competitors  the moms country fried beef is good too but sometimes there is too much pepper in the rice    i dine here because it is convenient for pick up orders or if my boss is paying but if i have more time to spare ill go to viet orleans down baronnethe market is going downhill recently i went and they were selling costco muffins in the baked goods after i wrote a complaint they started carrying frogs bakery stuff which is ok but overpriced the last few times ive been there the food in the hot grab and g section has been soggy burritos in tin foil or burned pizza i do like the farmers market on saturdays though especially the little baby goats the soap guy bringsi was a bit harsh giving it one star based on horrible service experience  the pizza was good  just make sure you do not get your drinks yourselfi would love to give this place at least 4 stars because the seafood is great however the staff and their customer service sucks big time its a hit or miss whos in a bad mood today and if you will get an attitude or not and the phone  you can forget it after 6pm i love getting them to steam and season my crabsremember alices diner  it feels that way when you go to dinardos  1970s wood paneling gaudy fish and fishing ecoutrements on the walls and crotchety old lady waitresses  i went with a group of 10 and every dish was basted in butter covered with garlic and soaked in crab meat  youd think that would be good but its coated with a pound of old bay seasoning  to make matters worse its horribly expensive for food that doesnt taste that great  i took a chance on this place and ill never make that mistake again  red lobster serves better fish than dinardos  avoid it like the plaguewent here on monday night ambiance is ok pretty nice for an amtrak station the beer selection isnt good  but they have a few decent taps food is good not spectacular oh and its expensive beer is 56 a pint not terrible though overall a decent time but not a landmarkfood is good always is manager is a maniac really unenjoyable place to eat but again food is goodthis place is a perfect example that a long line isnt always worth the wait i flew into nashville  hungry and came straight to the pancake pantry but only to be met with an hour long line for a table  despite all that time i still had trouble picking from their huge list of different pancakes so i just ordered the pigs in a blanket because it seemed like a safe bet  the server was no help as she was busy running around tending to other tables instead of offering suggestions  when the order came out i couldnt help but notice how underwhelming my meal looked  the food itself was nothing special  im 99 sure i couldve made it at home which is never a good thing  when it was all said and done i was out 2 hours of my time and about 15 bucks  dont make the same mistake as i did  tldr  skip the line and go to dennysslow service pizza was missing some flavor we got the bianca pizza forgot the full name and it was mainly just oil garlic and cheese garlic knots were burnt and not a good kind of burnt it just wasnt that greatfood was okay expected more for all the hype and popularity burger wasnt any better than whataburger for the price ill keep going to in and out better burger better price and no waiting sunday afternoon we were going to stop again already been here earlier in the week the drive thru line wasnt out on speedway so thought it might be a short wait we pulled in only two cars in front of us still ended up waiting almost 15 minutes for the two cars to go so we finally placed our order at 153pm it took from 153pm until 216pm to get to the drive thru window to pay once we paid we waited at the window for another 15 minutes i finally got somebodys attention and asked why after 45 minutes they still didnt have a bbq sandwich and a bowl of chili ready thats all we ordered he apologized and went to check came back 5 minutes later with a lukewarm bbq sandwich couldnt taste the bbq and a warm bowl of chili no spoon no napkins obviously the food was prepared when we ordered it 45 minutes prior whats worse is that once we got our food we still couldnt leave because there were two cars between us and speedway still waiting for their food the guy inside finally came out and asked them to move over to the parking lot so we could leave we spent more than one hour in the drive thru believe me the food was definitely not worth that kind of wait if i knew id be spending an hour in the drive thru i would have opted to go dine at olive garden when looking inside there were several employees walking around and talking to each other none of which showed any sense of urgency they need to seriously rethink how they want to operate their drive thru operation not to mention the parking lot they should reroute the drive thru so that it does not go out to speedway makes it very difficult for people who want to park and go inside  our visit earlier in the week went slightly better still spent way too much time in the drive thru although the bbq sandwich tasted much better and was hot on our first visit and had the right amount of bbq sauce  after our last visit i doubt well be back anytime soon hopefully they can figure out how to run a drive thru and maybe establish an escape route so youre not stuck behind other cars waiting for their food very very frustrating there is no food that is worth that kind of waiting and the food here is not even that good dont waste your time go someplace where you can get your food while its still hot like in and out i have better things to do with my time than sit in their drive thruwe were in town to visit friends and thought we would check out the local vegan food  the food was great the service horrible  if i had the choice i wouldnt give a tip  our waitress was rude and it wasnt just her the other waitress there was pretty awful too  i asked for honey and i only got it when my tea was 34 empty  she slammed it on the table very rudely  the building is cool inside is neat think modern day hip diner vibei have visited this place a few times twice i left because they didnt have any donuts left i gave the benefit of the doubt that maybe they are so good that they sell out fastbefore noon and im just to late the third time i came in and no one was working the counter at all i saw no one anywhere i stood and waited for awhile i saw two people sitting at a table eating and assumed they were customers and not employees after a period of time i left confused i could have taken some counter displays and left the store and no one would have known i gave it one last time and they had no donuts as usual but my friend and i ordered a breakfast sandwich it was actually not bad at all fresh bagels but that didnt win me over the employees seem not interested in being there all the times i went there other then that one time when you had no employees working they seem to have a little attitude trust me you are not doing me a favor so why have employees who act like they dont care i could go to dds across the street acme for donuts wawa and the list goes onin your hometown you have your gotos for best food and service  when travelling especially solo its a crapshoot  was feeling bbq or mexican tonight so yelp is my buddy or so i thought  huma was the mex choice but when i arrived 7pm saturday place was packed and i didnt want to stand outside waiting  kitty corner is a grill a thai spot pizza and yes fired up bbq a quick check of the yelp reveals 4 stars though im looking at an empty parking lot  inside i notice one gal behind the counter no customers  tables all need a wipe down  she clearly doesnt take pride in her work   so im on alert here and i ask her whats good  she recommends the brisket which is not 13 or 14 like other bbq on the menu but 17  comes with 3 sides reviews i saw liked the beans and the corn  but as im looking through a glass window i can see the beans look like theyve been in there all afternoon the corn is on its last scoop and sorry the mac n cheese scared me off  looked like nobody had any all day dry as the desert   the brisket was a good portion she poured some bbq sauce on then scooped the last of the corn and a pitiful amount of beans on my plate plus one of the last two slices of cornbread again skimpy what was there should have been one piece  onto a tray with a medium sweet tea at just under 20   brisket good tender just a slight bit dry and lukewarm spots that were cold  could have used a quick reheat  i wish she had given me a side of bbq sauce because what she put on only covered the top slice   beans flavorful smokeyspicy and good enough for nearly being dried up  skimped on the portion corn okay good flavor but lukewarm and again skimpy portion sweet tea perfect sweetness but i would have liked a bit of ice in it and a lemon slice  summary  ive had much better fresher hotter bbq for half this price  commanding a premium for this brisket wasnt worth it  and im being nice when i say i could have gone to a buffet where i would have found all these items and much more for a similar price plus dessert  if youre gonna let food sit in pans for hours best you not put in a display case for customers to wonder aboutthe new design of this teavana concept store allows for more employee interactions  aka pestering and bugging you as you move from corner to corner a lot like an apple store i wish they had the back counter againim sorry to say that i cant give more than 2 stars this used to be my favorite pizza shop in levittown but after a serious price hike ruse staff and a lapse in the quality of their products they have lost my patronage  today i called them to order a medium pizza as a last ditch effort to hopefully keep ordering there only to be hung up on twice by a rude fellow who could barely speak englishdecent coffee here but after i put a buck tip on my receipt my bill was over 6 for one 12oz mocha sorry but that absurd wont be back2 donuts  small and a large coffee  for 9  beilers donuts at reading terminal market have better and cheaper donuts went here last night for their taco tuesday special of 99 tacos the chips they served with the salsa was stale i ordered an ice tea and it was day old we started by ordering 9 tacos i asked for a side of sour cream but never got it the second order we ordered 3 more but asked for shredded cheese on them to which we never got they were not busy so to me there was no excuse for not giving what we asked for when we ordered will not go backi use yelp all the time and i think this is my first review my nine dollar kale salad was so disappointing that i felt a need to say something the kale had bits of spoiled kale in it and was a little too mushy the feta was scant and provided the only flavor in the salad the dressing had no flavor and for nine bucks it could have been a little heftier synopsis soggy sub par kale a few walnuts approximately one tablespoon of feta non descript dressing and soggy cranberries ill be sticking to coffee from here on out pros patio is nice and has plenty of shadethe food and pastries are incredible but the service is so unbelievably slow and overall just bad its hard to justify going back dont expect refills on water or coffee dont expect to order within 20 minutes or get your food within 40 to add insult to injury they add a tip on and wont do split checks try calling and youll be on hold until the system puts you to voice mail if you can put up with it more power to you i used to love going here to josefs for lunch but its just gotten so badthis place treats me like im homeless  i came into the cafe to meet my mom for breakfast she met me at my table and we were exchanging mail and discussing what to get  one of the workers came over and informed us that wed have to order something that tables are only for paying customers  ummm yes can we take our coats off   their coffee is oknot great  but they have lots of tables and plenty of room to spread out and study which is a huge plus  i also like that theyre open until 10great service brings this up from one star   the first time i came here i probably would have reviewed it as five stars but i only had beer at the bar the service was excellent   tonight the service was excellent in the dining area and the bock beer was good but thats where the good news ends   i ordered soft pretzels with the cheese dip which was just ok and i probably wouldnt order again hard to describe but get a pretzel in a great german restaurant and youll know the difference  these seemed more like frozen from a box and the cheese sauce was entirely unmemorable  i ordered a bloody mary it was a disaster  of the accoutrements on top of the mary the shrimp was just bad rubbery and had a terrible texture the olive was off and the cheese was  poor but the worst of it was the tomato juice  i could only taste one seasoning no tomato  the seasoning may have been old bay which is ok but i want a bloody mary not a cup of old bay other than two sips it went untouched   the meal finished up with a disaster as a main course i had a ribeye steak medium rare  you expect extra fat with a ribeye but the connective tissue was terrible  you can see from the picture this was a very cheap cut of meat and im someone that loves round steak in gravy  the steak came with blanched green beans and a potato dish with parmesan sauce these were both fine  so between my two visits i would recommend coming my here only for the granite city beers which are pretty good but the bar is otherwise pretty limited it seems  the service was excellent but that alone cant fix he serious shortcomingsi travel often for work and visit many subways this particular location is probably the slowest unfriendliest most disorganized one that i have been too ive gone here 4 days in a row during off peak hours and am i am still waiting longer than normal for my sandwich   the employees there seem like they are unhappy to be there you do not get the typical welcome to subway greeting yesterday they ran out of green peppers and onions at 2pm today the gentleman forgot to put egg on my ham egg and cheese flatbread sandwich  overall the negative feeling given off by the employees is felt throughout the store and running out of items often combined with the time it takes them to make a sandwich resulted in the 2 star ratingthis place is comparable to disney world  all the bells and whistles you might want for a local pub except everyone and their mother is there with you  be ready for 2 hour waits to be seated and having to maneuver through a herd of cows to get a drink  oh and be prepared to park a mile away on popular nights  once you are finally able to get a seat the food is decent for your typical pub foodwhen we pulled into the parking lot my dining companion immediately said looks like a wingstop  after walking in and seeing the menu i had to agree  similar concept  i was amused to see random menu items like crab rangoon fried pickles and korean beef tacos on a wing menu  i decided to order the same meal as i would at wingstop to compare  parmesan garlic wings with fries and ranch dressing  the combo was 699 and an extra 70 cents or so for a large ranch dressing bummer to charge extra for it  dinner companion dc ordered the chicken strips in the hot mama sauce with mashed potato  the wings took 10 minutes to cook and when they came out they looked pretty tempting  big pieces of parmesan but not drowning in sauce  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside just like they should be  the size of the wings varied pretty widely  i had a 5 piece and 3 were what id consider normal while 2 were considerably smaller  i was pretty disappointed with the taste though  they werent very flavorful  not much garlic at all and i love garlic  the fries were just plain fries with some seasoned salt not the magical awesomeness of wingstop fries    dc was kind enough to let me try his boneless wings a rarity to talk him into sharing  they were strangely thin pieces of chicken in almost a tempura type batter  bonus points for that since most breaded tenders are overwhelmingly breaded  the hot mama sauce was pretty good started out with a sweet honey taste and quickly transitioned over to a heat  too spicy for me im a total spice wimp but a tasty few bites  overall dc and i agreed we still like wingstop better for now  ill go back because a its so much closer b  i have a thing for fried pickles and c i want to try out the thai chili lime flavorate here with my wife a few days ago when we were on vacation the atmosphere is cool but the food left both of us with some pretty bad stomach issues the cole slaw and the salad were likely the culprits as they werent as cold as maybe they should have been probably wouldnt go back if we went back to fl for vacationour first visit here  my wife ordered classic grilled chicken sandwich but chicken was still pink she also ordered waffle fries that were cold and soggy i ordered rice and beans and corn and they were coldi much prefer the kirkwood and laclede locations this place is so so stingy with the toppings its also slower than other locations yet always has more people workingi really dont know why i keep coming to this location  the staff is unfriendly the food tastes old 710 times and it is usually just a bad experience  the few times the food is hot it is great  just wish it would be like that more oftenwe must have come here on an off night off the three appetizers and 7 entrees we ordered only a few of the items were good the meat was over done the entrees were bland and the appetizers were nothing special i have two stars for the service and drinks which were goodsince a lot of people have made comments about the poor service here ill start off by saying that our service was very good  unfortunately i cant say too many positive things about the food  my kids both ordered from the childrens menu my 5 year old loved her corn dog and the crinkly fries were really good  my 8 year old had the kids rib plate which was a basket of 3 ribs and fries  each meal came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was actually quite good  my daughter said the ribs were ok  my husband had a half rack sweet potato fries and beans  i had a texas beef sandwich and sweet potato fries  my husband wasnt at all enthused over the ribs  i had a taste and i had to agree  mediocre at best  his sweet potato fries like mine were greasy and tasted like theyd been fried in old grease  my texas beef sandwich was not half bad  the sauces were pretty good but nothing special  now about an hour or so later my husband and i both have upset stomachs  we wont return  there are too many other places in the area to eatwhy waste our time on mediocritybefore trying this restaurant  everything in me wanted to give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars based on the pictures  reviews    sadly  i can not do that  our hostess was unkind but i can get over that  as for the food  i thought the veggie burger sounded fantastic and even thought it tasted pretty good until the last few bites  started feeling sick right away  also ordered the onion rings as an appetizer  they left little to be desired  very bland tasting    if i were to go back  i would give the milkshakes a try and thats it after seeing the reviews here im feeling kind alone but this location of the bakery is just plain disappointing  in the past as a frequent rtm shopper and fan id sometimes give in to the need and buy something from their counter  pretty much every time its mediocre or bad  my family has grown to shelf the termini reputation its no longer a treat  in recent years someone converted me back but through their original location on 8th st  wow  that place is incredible so now i have to convince my whole family its the original location thats still good  theyre skeptical  this campaign has lowered my guard and once again while shopping at the terminal i decided to pick up a last minute dessert for my familys sunday get together  fail  no one wanted to finish the first few slices of the chocolate cheese cake i brought  i thought my sister was on a diet or something when she only took one bite  eventually my familys polite mode wore off a record 3 minutes and they were pretty liberal with their critique of the cake  playdoh was perhaps the most agreeable for the table thats what the cake tasted like  i admit it was nasty  how do you have a name like termini and not pull off a basic cheese cake  i had a decent maccaroon while waiting there but otherwise im sorry i didnt just go the the super market  and that folks is the ultimate insult no  anyone know why in the world this location has become the bizzarroworld bakery of the original location  perhaps they should just be the termini bros cannoli depot and stick to the apparent success of thatthis particular location was awful first and last time ill go there i ordered a specialty bagel sandwich it came out cold when i asked them to heat it the guy who was clearly the manager rudely blamed me for not hearing my name i told him whether i heard him or not the cheese was a cold unmelted slab so it had never been warm to begin with he continued to throw me attitude while a very nice employee mouthed a quiet apology and heated it for me later while heading to the filthy bathroom i overheard the employees arguing with this sad excuse of a manager this would be one star  except for the kind employee who took pity on the customermaybe it was because i got my sandwich during the bike race but it was just completely underwhelming  understuffed and overpriced breakfast sandwiches on a soft boring roll  dont see what all the hype is about  havent had the water ice but told its underwhelmingits was 640pm and they had the doors locked to the dining room we awkwardly made eye contact with the employees inside working then two little kids came and opened the door the employees didnt attended to us at all and pushed us off and made us wait nobody was in the drive thru of course shake machine was down like anywhere else around here we just got two tacos and leftservicesomewhat confusing when you order at the counter and not the register but owners and workers are very friendly   foodvery low quality and not very appetizing the beef in the gyro collapsed in my mouth like tofu and the basmati rice didnt taste very traditional the beef isnt sliced like a traditional gyro but cut in a elongated tube shape the food tastes microwaved and it comes out too fast for comfort   atmospherehas a very homey feel that makes you comfortable   locationnot the best because it is in the middle of green hills but the traffic on that side of town is usually pretty horrific   staff everyone was very friendly productive attentive and they were all around good folks   overall i would go back if the food was good  but unfortunately i was only impressed by the servicetook a long time and the person at the drive through wasnt very nice also i dont go to panera in general very often bc when i hear the total for my order and get ready to actually pay i kick myself bc the price is far too high for what you get how did i end up here and why am i paying 12 for a half of a salad half a sandwich and some teai wanted to be a fan but this strange donut was not what i expected   their dough is oddly similar to the local grocery store variety it doesnt really have that melt in your mouth consistency plus their apple filled peanut butter topping was raw inside strange for a relatively successful business touting great tasting delectables   their chocolate covered jelly filled is really more cake than jelly and sadly i cant even remember the last donut i ate was   so for 1900 a dozen id rather just pay 8 for a dozen at the local grocery store id get the same donuts there and fully cooked  ive read mixed reviews about strange donuts and this fist time visit is probably this asian ladys lastoverpricedayce lunch heavy in the ricechewy seaweed pepsi is over 2 for a soda staff was nice but wouldnt recommend the lunch sushi at leastbought a 2 medium deal the toppings were very light and the chicken appetizer i got was awful pizza hut improved their appearance over the years but quality has seem to fall off a bitso its breakfast time one of the busiest times for this establishment there was only one cashier with a long line ridiculous he was going very slow almost as if he was trying to be slow  i also work in the food industry and ive dealt with very long lines and you have to be fast and accurate to make the morning rush a success well he was doing neither  everytime i come here theres only one cashier thats just going to piss off customers  decent hash brownsthis place gave me high expectations and it really did not live up the atmosphere was relaxing at the bar where my wife and i ate our dinner the selections of burgers was outstanding and i really like how they have a contest every week with different burgers a faceoff where the most ordered burger moves on to the next week where a new challenger awaits the sides were very good and the beer list gets a thumbs up from me too the problems was the actual burger i am not even sure if it still on the menu but i just didnt get it it left me desiring more maybe i made the wrong choice which might be easy to do since there are so many options ill try this place again and see how i feel about it but after one visit i wasnt thinking about the next time i would be back i was thinking about a different burger place to tryla colombe is philadelphias favorite nonstarbucks roaster and i just dont get it  the cafe itself is sleek and cool  you see less laptops here and more newspapers which is a nice change of pace  conveniently located near rittenhouse they are in the perfect spot for tourists and businessmen alike  that aside i moonlight as a barista from time to time and i personally think the beans are nothing to write home about  quality has definitely gone down over the past few years likely due to higher quantities of beans being roasted  i find that the brewed coffee leaves a bitter dry taste in my mouth  not unlike starbucks  the espresso is better but still not as great as i would have expected  id agree with a previous reviewer as to the beans being roasted way too dark  in fact the key to lcs success has probably been locally producing a product thats still better but not much more than starbucks  ill give them 2 stars because i will drink it most independent cafes serve it but there are better roasters in the philadelphia area chestnut hill coffee fonseca coffee etcok  this place was a turn offso i left  what turned me off was the  with the captain ds atmosphere  if im paying 40 for an entree i would at least want the wait staff to not have on t shirts  it was a no gowe took our family of 4 to eat here  found the seating situation inside to be tremendously unaccommodating for families w small children specifically children that are in high chairs it was cramped although the giant family style table in the middle looks cool the bar height seating isnt ideal for a kid in a hair chair or a toddler really i like that there is an option to go through a drive through but ive never found food to travel as well as it tastes fresh unfortunately because of that ill likely not go often the food that we had was good thoughthe cashier told me my 20 off pads or tampons had been automatically applied from my extra care card and that she could use 5 of extra bucks neither of these was applied she did adjust the price of a box of cheerios for me because someone forgot to take down the promo tag from the previous week but im a bit upset about the 20 off the extra bucks i can use another time but im not sure ill be needing to buy more feminine hygiene products before this coupon expiresa lot of people in jenkintown seem to love this place but im not impressed the bagels are soso and they are extremely over priced i am really picky with bagels and these just dont make the cut if you like ny style bagels this is definitely not the place for you they also make bread and have day old bread and bagels at a reduced price if youre in jenkintown and craving a bagel there really arent many options as i am not a fan of breugers across the street eitherthis casual seafood restaurant is situated in an atmospheric spot at the end of the pier in santa barbara and had been recommended to us by two different acquaintances however we were all disappointed with the quality of our meals the new england clam chowder was pasty thickened with flour the coconut shrimp tasted like what i can buy by the bag frozen at trader joes  and the prices were quite high given the quality  overall weve found the quality of food in the santa barbara restaurants to be amazing but i wouldnt recommend this place25 i should preface this by saying im not a beer drinker  came here last nite with a couple of coworkers  we were looking for a casual sit down kind of place to meet up and one of my coworkers suggested coming out here  as we walked up to the place we saw tons of people outside and thought looks like we gotta wait but it was actually a bunch of guys standing around a table  since the weather is still nice in the midwest most people were just waiting for an outside table  we elected to go inside  ambience alright i know some places are dark but you may have needed night vision to see my wife and i as least where they sat us  i know this place is a pub and all but it smelled pretty bad  the place smelled like a dirty dish towel    menu menu had your typical bar food appetizers burgers and sandwiches etc  they did have a few entrees pastas and such and some yourkshire favorites shepperds pie bangers and mash  nothing overwhelming by any means  as for beer they have a pretty large selection  again i dont drink so i cant really speak to its impressiveness but my coworkers seemed to be pretty excited for it  service our server was a grungy looking dude but was very friendly  not the most attentive and seemed to interrupt at odd points of the evening but still a nice guy  food we started out the evening with some black bean nachos  the nachos were good and loaded with black beans  it was nice because they layered it properly as opposed to having the top layer and nothing below  my wife ordered the portabello sandwich i got the bangers and mash sausage mashed potatoes and peas  my one coworker got the sheperds pie and my other coworker got the chicken fingers  i think all of agreed our food wasnt phenomenal but it wasnt bad either  my wife liked her sandwich though it was pretty oily  the one shining moment of the meal appeared to be the beer for my coworkers so at least they can rock that  overall yeah im not the barpub kinda guy  it didnt help that the place smelled but it was just ok  im sure the outdoor seating is really nice during the summer but this place just didnt do it for me food wise  im guessing beerpub people would dig this place but not me  chuck norris rating rock bottomfood 4 service 1 total score 255  ive been here twice with the most recent time on saturday may 6th for lunch to celebrate my sisters birthday with our mom and grandmother although i dont remember the service being bad the first time i came a couple years ago the service was d r e a d f u l this last time around the place was full when we arrived at around 115pm and we were seated at a table in the bar area that was the worst place that we couldve been seated because our waiter was the bartender the only bartender he was nice and friendly but his visits to our table were few and far between and we had extremely long waits while waiting for things like our food our checks our drinks our refills and everything else that we asked him for to add insult to injury there were constantly groups of 45 employees circulating around the bar area talking and laughing but not working so here we are waiting for service the entire time we are there and looking at people who work there not working smh  i ordered a side caesar salad in addition to my ribs with macncheese and green beans i had to wait over 30 minutes to receive it i went to the bar to ask our waiterbartender where it was and where the rest of our food was and he gave an excuse about going ot check on it in a second about 510 minutes later he finally checked on it it was brought out by another member of staff and had a weird red liquid residue on the side of the bowl i dont know what it was blood sauce a different salad dressing i felt sick to my stomach while attempting to eat my salad with that smudge on my plate staring at me so after our entrees were brought out about 1 minute later seriously i asked for a clean plate for my salad this came shortly after  while we all liked our food the service left a lot to be desired then after being there for about 15 hours we had a long wait to be checked on again to ask for refills and boxes one of the boxes seriously took about 15 minutes to arrive we received that along with our two checks which we had to flag the bartenderwaiter after waiting for another 20 minutes for him to come back to our table to collect the payments i mean seriously where is the help  the food at cheddars is good and the prices are great for the amount of food that you get but the service here this time was awful im not gonna lie and say that i wont be back but it will probably be another year or two before i returni am giving a less than stellar review because of an incident that happened to me  on september 10th i was in the store selecting some baked goods when an employee pushing a large cart of chicken ran into me  my back was turned so of course i didnt see her approaching and the employee and full cart ran into my left ankleheel  the pain was so strong i could do nothing but cry out then i was silent trying to get composed  luckily the skin up the back of my heel and ankle was only scraped off up to about 5 inches but no deep cuts  it took a long time for the store manager to arrive and see if i wanted a bandage  she took my name in phone number saying that the corporate office would give me a call to investigate  so far i have not received a call  i wont be back for a very long timeupdated again  just when i think the service cant get any crappier it does the only reason i still come here is because my daughter makes me unreal get it together sparks location    service and quality has not been up to par since my last review sat there for 10 minutes last night without anyone greeting us or taking a drink order had to go ask the manager if they could send someone oververy disappointing seem to be prepetully temporary closed the excuse was maintained at first now what excessive heat possiblytried 2 different cupcakes  the chocoholic and the cookie dough  both were dry and crumbly not cake like at all  expected betteri love that there is a local coffee shoplunch spot tucked away on mass ave with local arts on the walls and outdoor seating sounds perfect right but yet i find myself going less and less the owner is unkind and so are many not all of the staff that almost always is enough to stop me but this morning my stomach won and i stopped in i got the usual brush off service with my mediocre 9 sandwich the bagel had grill marks but the texture of being microwaved the eggs were overcooked and unseasoned and missing the bacon i ordered the younger man working the grill was friendly and that is all i can say argh this place could be so much bettercame in on a sunday afternoon not too busy took 20 mins to get 1 cappuccino although it was good the high price for a small cappuccino does not make it worth it wont be returningpizza will do when you are hungry but i lived in italy for 4 years soooo  but the ac must be broken because it is hot in this place and we were the only customers and the tables were not wiped cleani had to use the masters baker because they worked with the company who did my wedding in 2008  the cake wasnt exactly how i wanted it appearance wise  it was acceptable but on your wedding you want it to be phenomenal  we froze the top layer to eat on our one year anniversary  the cake still tasted good one year laterthe food was wonderful the server not so much  they were rude on the phone when they found out that i had a groupon and were unpleasant when we showed up because of the groupon  the server was curt and actually denied me when i asked for an additional knife  i have dined out frequently for the last 30 years and that was definitely a first  we were rushed through everything and when i inquired about their dessert menu which would have been an upsell for them she turned and left before we had a chance to order  then they had the audacity to add an 18 gratuity to a 2 person bill  they were pretty unbelievable  it seemed like it was a motherdaughter operation because speaking from a lifetime career of management nobody would ever keep a surly employee like that around unless they were family  but heres a newsflash simpson house  if you dont want people using groupon gift certificates stop advertising with groupon  the idea of groupon is to find new customers not chase them off with bad attitudes  its really a shame that we experienced this because the food was great and we would have returned had we been treated decentlyfirst time there for 12 i had a bowl of soup and a grilled ham and cheese the corn chowder with bacon was pretty good although warm not hot as for the sandwich the cheddar was of low quality neon orange and flavorless krafts crackerbarrel cheese is far superior the ham was sparse and equally bland the whole wheat bread had seasonings and was the best part of my meal quantity wasnt bad but overall i see no need to returni do not understand why theres always such a long wait time for a table at this restaurant  after several attempts to dine there im the evenings my wife and i ate there on a sat afternoon a time when the wait was shorter than a half hour  our table was not wiped off and silverware was available upon request after our appetizer arrived  the food was ok and our server was fine    compared to other fairview heights restaurants the decor is nice it features a fish tank  its hard to justify the slightly overpriced entrees fries not included with burgers for a view of some fish  not sure if it was the greasy onion rings or some other factor but my wife became sick to her stomach later in the evening  i hesitate to place the entire blame for this on cheddars but it will prevent us from revisitingi was not impressed with the wings at all very disappointing for a place with wings in its name they werent cooked well and where slimy the sauce was pretty good but thats all i can say about them slimyi dont recommend this place for breakfast the only reason i would go is if i didnt have other options or got tired of visiting the same places over again the food was not really good i had the avocado toast which was very bland and the popeye skillet which was mediocre and unappetizingdry the exact reason i stopped coming here years ago you might even get a white spot in the bottom of your cupi was really excited to try this restaurant i heard they made everything from scratch including buns and condiments but after trying to seemed like a hip restaurant to be at but burgers were very bland ive had better burgers elsewhere it very popular and we waited a long time to eat but wasnt worth it in the endthe chicken wings here are nasty fatty and greasy skin and the chicken meat smelled funny i threw away almost my entire order i would have asked for my money back if id dined in too bad the pizza here when they were located elsewhere in town used to be great but now it tastes like it is cheaply made i can still stomach the pizza but those wings were totally disgusting there are too many new restaurants popping up all over down town and midtown so blue moon better step it up or they will start to lose repeat customersculvers is what it is   kind of the redheaded steplovechild of a fast food burger joint and an ice cream shoppe   if youre really craving a quick burger this is not the first place that would come to mind   if youre looking for ice cream excuse mecustard this is not the first place that would come to mind   however if youre looking for a place that offers fast food burgers and custard then this is one of the few places that can do it   average burgers and average custard  this isnt a criticism of this particular location but of all culvers in general120 extra for nuts on a sundae but the candy toppings are free  due to the prime location right off 465 on 67kentucky avenue its usually pretty busyi came here for a shoulder of lamb because my regular butcher was out of them  i asked and a guy quickly showed one skin side up to me  the foreshank was squared off and missing which is a shame  when i got it home i found that it is not properly butchered at all it is just a chunk of  a split whole lamb carcass that was simply cut and squared off with a bandsaw  so it still has all the neck back  rib bones  and probably the scapula  still in it  you expect this sort of thing from a cheap supermarket not an allegedly specialist butcher and meat market  first and last time customer here  lesson learned  in future its espositos just up the block or nothingive been to many cosi shops this one like all of the rest is okay but a little overpriced considering what you get the portions are small and should cost no more than 5 or 6 however they stroke you for more like 9 ive had better sandwiches for 3  the one cool thing about this location is on a nice day they have lots of outdoor seating other than that it doesnt have much going for it save your money and timetour was in the rain but we prevailed our tour guide was ok wish it would of geared alittle towards the 3 kids we were withi used to come here a lot especially when i was younger i remember coming here and always buying cuban sandwiches or buying something to drink with the ruffles chips after many years i am highly disappointed some of their food taste old or has no flavor such as their cakes i cant complain about their workers their workers arent mean they do interact with you and are friendly even if they have a serious face they always tend and cater to their guests but the food needs to be stepped up the only plus side that i see is that they finally opened on saturdaysi am a long time starbucks customer and i usually go 57 times a week i use the mobile app almost every time and they still manage to get it wrong i rarely get an acknowledged when i come in and i always always say thank you and have a good day i would say 1 in 20 times someone looks up with a half interest and then goes back to what they are doing i go anywhere from 6am to 3pm and its always the same there was one guy working the register sunday who was very personable hire more of him i would almost rather pay the 20 upcharge at the airport just because they are friendly and always get my drink rightreview of two people with 3 tacos each tequila lime it taste like someone was smoking a cigarette while they were making it other reviewer green sauce yum   brisket un chewable dont even do it   fish the best of 3 i had simple did i think it was only so good cause the rest sucked so bad  shrimp more shrimp please  avocado ehhh needs more spice to be called a spicy avocado tacoextremely disappointed with the crawfish here  i think they use the same water when doing new boils  theyre too spicy and the flavor isnt there at all  the only good thing about it was they were decent size which is why im giving it a 25 instead of a 1  if you want good flavorful crawfish that isnt overly spicy you should check out schaefers on lake avenue  they are the best crawfish that you can get from a commercial establishment  if you pay with cash you will receive a discount too  i will never be back to fishermans cove againi arrived at 5 am and asked what was fresh the lady behind the counter gave me a confused look and waved her hand at the donuts in the case i asked about the donuts on the cooling rack she implied they were all the same i am pretty sure the maple bar i got from the case was cooked the previous day it wasnt soft enough to be baked that morning the also do not offer a french crueler so whats the pointi chose to order take out for jaipur for lunch since my girlfriend doesnt really eat indian food and their online prices looked to be cheaper than that of my favorite local indian place desi village what a mistake i picked up an order of meat samosas pakoras chicken tikki masala and a side of raita my first complaint is that the prices that they have listed on their site are definitely outdated those items together came to almost 3000 the samosas were decent but the seasoning was a little on the overpowering side the pakoras were cold and not very good at all and the raita pretty much tasted like bland yogurt water yuck another peeve was that i ordered the chicken tikka masala  which was 14 on its own generally anytime i order this a side of rice is included this was just a small plastic bowl of mostly sauce with maybe a cup of chicken chunks in it seriously what am i supposed to do drink the sauce i wouldnt have ordered the side of yogurt water which there was alot of had i known id have no rice to put it on ill never go here again  another girlfriend of mine and i dined at an indian joint on friday night last week got twice as much food and only paid 45 for the both of us dont waste your hardearned  on this crap  february 15 2011probably the worst casino in the nation no free drinks when you sit at the tables i was playing at a table for almost 2 hours i was down a lot and asked for comps to use for a drink they took my card and came back after 20 minutes just to tell me i couldnt get anything and to try again in an hour long lines at the cashier on weekends and bad service i wish there was another casino on this areadined there yesterday and was a little disappointed by how dirty the restaurant wasbbq sauce carrier and menus were sticky with caked on grease and sticky fingerprints my water came out with an ant on the lemon wedge the mason jar my beer came in had lip prints on the rim and the booth itself had crumbs all over it as if it hadnt been wiped down in days fortunately the food was still tasty but it kind of makes you wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen when the front of house is so dirtynever seen such high beef prices in my life they have more than doubled their prices over the last year price gouging at its finest nice produce thoughim sorry but i really hated this place i wanted to like it with the massive amount of great reviews but everything i had was incredibly mediocre   i know its americanized and it was done fairly poorly  i got the sesame chicken and they were extremely soggy and the sauce tasted like no other sesame chicken ive ever had it tasted like someone dumped a bottle of mauls on it   the crab rangoon tasted like it lacked the crab part and was just cream cheese shoved in  i wont try it againso in trying to decide where i was going to find some delicious treats for my wife for her 40th birthday i read some yelp reviews on this place and thought i would give it a try  i read all of the reviews here that said you had to try the puff tart or something so that made me lean towards here  also my wife likes macaroons and all of the macaroon slangers have convinced her just how vital it is to have macaroons come in a snazzy little box  they sell those too so my choice was made  i walk in and ask for the puff tart thing    oh no sir we do not have any of those today those are labor intensive we do not make those just any day  umm okay  i could not imagine a italian restaurant that advertises an excellent veal parmesan and then when i order it they tell me it is too labor intensive to make and they did not feel like making it today so instead just order the spaghetti    ok fine i see you have some macaroons  ill take a dozen thrown in those little macaroon boxes the ladies love so much  oh sir we are out of macaroon boxes but we can throw a dozen in a brown paper bag for you  really  i thought this was supposed to be part of the presentation or at least most people argue it is  ok just throw some in a brown bag if it is not too much to ask perhaps one without a hole in it  ok along with that ill have a peanut butter cupcake    we dont have any of those  sure you do right there pointing at sign that says peanut butter cupcake  oh sir we have been waaaay too busy this morning making cupcakes to change our signs  that sign is wrong that is a different cupcake    um ok just give me that one i guess  as far as the taste for everything i got  ehh it was fine  look we are talking about cupcakes and peanut butter bars at a pretty incredible price so i think it should be worlds better than an okay cupcake  more than anything i think they should carry everything they make  just as i was writing this review i thought well in fairness perhaps it is not on their menu on their website maybe it is more of a specialty item  just checked nope it s there  perhaps they should put an asterisk beside of it that denotes it is labor intensive to make such a treat and they have them in stock from time to time when they feel like making themif you are a die hard gambler then the hard rock will fit the bill im more into tangible spending but have dropped a few  in the slots when i come here its usually with out of town guests   not as nice as foxwoods in connecticut and doesnt compare to vegas but will serve your desire to live the dream no free drinks and no ventilation if you walk about a mile you will find its a bit cleaner and newer towards the hotel side   lots of slot machines and poker rooms for your donating er um gambling pleasuregood food but terrible service i can only put half the blame on the staff as they were shorthanded but needed to express a better attitude toward customers and focus on getting orders correct and out on time orders kept coming out duplicated cold or completely wronglunch buffet is gross and has not much variety chicken tikka masala is campbells tomato soup base they replenish buffet by dumping bowls of refill into trays not replacing the whole tray ambiance is pretty so its a shame its basically indian fast foodseriously i dont get what people like about this place its over priced groceries you can get the same things at trader joes for a fraction of the price sure theres hot mamas in yoga pants shopping here but they aint coming home to cook for me so whatever i rather spend my money on other markets that price things fairly then go here where omg its organic so let me just jack up the price arbitrarily that said ill give this place an extra star for having a delicious caffood was fresh and good even though there were hardly any customers service was slow lots of conversation between staffim not a huge rum fan but ive had really great mojitos before so i said id try my husbands before i ordered one for me  it was ok but not worth raving about so the waitress said i dont have to make it with rum i can use vodka mmmok honestly i think that was a mistake it was fine but also meh the salad i ordered had an entire avocado sliced over it and it wasnt quite ripe  a ripe avocado would have made the difference  the dressing was fresh tasting but a teeny cup was all i was given the fish tacos had store bought soft tacos which were lackluster and very wet cole claw under the fish which was tilapia i ended up just eating the insides as the tacos themselves had no taste and fell apart from the liquid  there was a teeny cup of guacomole which i could make so much better and there was so little salsa picante i couldnt really review it the waitress who also filled as the bartender forgot our water delivered hubbys tortilla soup dull a long while before my salad arrived forgot my drink order also for a long time and when i asked for a second teeny cup of guacomole she said sure and never delivered it she was friendly and apologetic for every wrong turn but with the cost of dining out which we love to do we wont be backthis place has all the breakfast basics so nothing really special i ordered the 2 egg omelette with asparagus and prosciutto  the asparagus was tiny and did not contain any spears but the prosciutto was adequate i do not eat bread so i asked for a substitute for my toast the server refused any substitute saying that it just comes out of the kitchen that way  fine there are maybe 11 tables in this very small space so she could have literally walked two paces to the cook and asked him for options  but i was told i could just not eat the toast my husband had the seafood benedict which was served on a biscuit instead of an english muffin so that was a unique offering however the hollandaise sauce was excessively citrusy the food wasnt necessarily bad but overpriced for what it was and there are many better places in the french quarteri  was really disappointed with my dinner the escargots were served with what i assume were canned artichoke hearts and parmesan that unusual combination masked the delicate flavor of the escargots and made the dish way too salty next i got the 20 beef bourguignon that tasted just like the pot roast at dennys  except that dennys is cheaper and comes with mashed potatoes it was served with two pieces of bread not on the side but on the edge of the plate that would have been ok until i found hidden under the bread one of those rectangles of butter wrapped in foil as the butter melted it began to slide into my dish kind of funny actually oh yeah the bourguignon also contained little pieces of undercooked potatoes something i pointed out to the waitress my daughter had mussels marinieres that were not too bad but with the addition of basil they didnt taste anything like french moules marinieres at least not the ones ive had in france on the positive side the desserts du jour were good and our server very pleasant i wont go back thoughoh this place has potential   the baked goods are delicious the service is not excellent and the business owners dont seem interested in improving what they are providing   after confusion about who to give my order to i reached the register i told the young man at the register that i would like whichever of the soups was vegetarian he rang me up when my food was delivered at the table i specifically asked if the soup was vegetarian two women who delivered the food said it was  it was not they served a vegetarian chicken soup even after being specifically asked about it   i sent the soup back and then had my meal interrupted an additional 23 times by their employees because their mistake necessitates them interrupting my meal to unpleasantly pseudoapologize  some excuses given we have a lot of new girls working here i gave my order to a man also you told me the soup was vegetarian when you delivered it we ran out of the soup so we substituted another  at this point i replied that i would have understood it if the cashier had told me that they were out of the vegetarian soup   i understand mistakes happen in food service but the buck needs to stop somewhere its not okay to serve people food they have been specifically asked not to i would not recommend trusting this restaurant with a food allergy or sensitivity problem   i hope this bakery can step up to the platei know pancake pantry is a staple of the nashvillain touristy breakfast stops but i gotta say its just not that great  the line around the block is offputting and the service is pretty brash the main goal is to get you in and get you out and this is definately made obvious by the servers  foodwise they have pretty amazing sweet potato pancakes that are really pretty righteous but not good enough to justify the line around the block or the hassle of going there    when i first moved here it was a spot we went to regularly but to me now it is clearly a tourist stop to be avoidedusually my sandwich is good but today it was terrible ordered number 16 even if its crowded i need my sandwich to come out good cheese and peppers fully covering the sandwich as i shouldwe did the tour today and were disappointed for the amount we paid  we had a groupon and paid 79  we made a total of 4 stops and tried jambalaya gumbo muffiletta and a brisket po boy  the samples are fairly small  our tour guide was preston and he told the group multiple times he has been doing the job for three weeks yet through other reviews it appears he has been doing tours for several months his facts were not very accurate and he was a bit offensive to almost everyone in the group  i would not recommend this tour all of the foods we tried are easy to find and you will pay less to try them on your own groupon has other deals to get a walking tour and the information will be more accurate and entertainingalways seen this restaurant and never stop so today my husband and i decided to give it a try  came in through a store which was quite busy and had some interesting things  i may pick up on the way out  got seated promptly and waited five minutes for our server lacey to take our drink orders she asked if we were also ready to order food but i explained this was our first  time dining here so instead of giving highlights she walked off when she came back 5 min later with our drinks and proceeded to take our oder walked off and never returned to refill our drinks coffee and water   we had to ask another server  for that  the next time she came back 15 min later was to bring food  the manager walked pass our table asking others how were their dining experience guess our opinion didnt matter  well lets get to the food  food was subpar we both ordered the smoke house breakfast the only thing from this dish that was good was the biscuits  both of our grits were under cooked my eggs were fried and chopped there version of scrambled and the gravy was bland  maybe this was an off day but i wasnt impressed if i come back i will definitely try something new and if this location i would need a different servertoo sugary and too sweet i know i know a cupcake is a dessert and has sugar etc etc  but these do not have a good balance i had the pumpkin patch here comes the bride and the happy birthday to me chocolate  pumpkin was the best of the three but mediocre  the birthday chocolate tasted like out of a boxspeaking of a friend who used to work in the cupcake business said flying cupcakes are from a boxi hope this isnt true but either way please fix the taste and balance i do not anticipate a return in the near future and this will not be a goto for mewe had a pick up order for lunch and the service at the pick up counter was great she checked and made sure that all the food was there and added extra silverware and stuff but food on the other hand was not very good we had the chips and dip and the dip tasted like it had mayo in it and should have been on a sandwich the bread was stringy like it had hair or something in it the nachos were gooey and not very good either i probably wont go again especially for pick upi ordered the snow crab legs  gulf shrimp dinner  the crab leg cluster was worse than youd get at red lobster very small skinny crab legs that didnt have much meat the shrimp were overcooked  rubbery    i would recommend avoiding this touristtrap of a restaurant    i asked the waitress about the craft beers available and all she told me was theyre ales well yes i could see that on the menu but she wasnt able to offer up any recommendations or helpful informationmy friend and i both ordered a burger and a shake the food was decent but portions were small apparently we also ordered food poisoning to go that was an extremely fun experiencei was so disappointed last time i was here the food was exquisite today i ordered the shrimp ceviche and the lobster tacos if i got more than three whole shrimps it will be a miracle the lobster tacos were less than mediocre tortilla was not fresh and dry very little lobster in the tacos and the cream salsa was way over spicy inedible the spanish rice was not at all fluffy it was hard and beyond dry 80 for poor food is upsetting the service was slow and un attentive again very disappointed  i will need to find another seafood placethe tables are filthy  i wiped one off with a napkin and it was black when i got done  its always very cold in there management is too cheap or lazy to turn the heat up in the winter  the food could be much betterordered take out from here the person at the bar acted put out by us coming to pick up our order the food was ok it would probably be better to eat at the restaurantawwww dang i so wanted to feel at home here since i live on willow and can walk over in 2 minutes i use about 110 of an ounce of nondairy in my coffee soy coconut milk whatever buddy wants 100 for my splash what about us vegans out here who like coffee get with the times and we will be backevery single time i order coffee here through the drive through its horrible or  they get it wrong i order the same thing every time and one or another of the employees cant understand simple ingredients or instructions and i get raspberry or something else completely different from what i say or the coffee itself is just brewed horribly finally after giving it one last try  i believe in second even third chances  they messed up again  and in the very least the manager very nice lady gave me my money back never went back again this branch also owns the one in tampa on dale mabry i prefer the service at that location way better never got a bad cup there always perfectdoes it smell bad yep but most places with that much fresh fish arent going to smell great the produce was pretty good lots of selections and 95 of it looked really fresh the other 5 not so much lots of spices and different meats to choose from the pork and beef i have my suspicions on it if i bought it i would only cook it well done the fish ah yes the fish they have some live ones and some dead ones floating in the live tank oops lots of selection on the fresh fish mullet sheepshead croaker blue fish ribbon fish salmon catfish tilapia etc i say fresh because you can tell its all frozen or previously frozen and some of it has that ive been dead too long look in their glassy frozen fish eyes we elected to go with with the still alive catfish got 3 of them and the hispanic gentlemen made a chopping motion that i assumed meant chop their heads off i said yes and was rewarded with the catfish cut into oblivion thrown in a bag and priced but probably my fault anyway took em home skinned em and made nuggets these arent american catfish its obvious both by the look smell and the stain on the meat that these bad boys come from asia not worth the price and the taste eh will i go back maybe but only if im driving by and need to blow a few minutespros  family friendly convenient location great crowd clean and no drunks in the restaurant during the day  cons service is horrible a little too expensive waiterswaitresses pretend youre not there the space is small and crammed do not expect to get your food served right when it is ready and if you ask something to the waiterwaitress they will get an attitude and get offended like you are inconveniencing them dont get the french toast  conclusion  if you want to sit down and take a break from the walking and etc this establishment should be not the last choice but one not your firstoverrated never wait in line for this pretty disappointing i swear theyre slinging bisquick pancakes tourist trapperhaps it was an off night given that this is reportedly a popular place  sometimes seems that if a restaurant is in a trendy neighborhood it just gives up on trying service wasnt  helpful  the tables were dirty and the food was mediocre  this review is from a visit this summer  we havent been backtake out the food was ready in 15 minutes the thai basil stir fry with chicken was very watery too spicy not flavorful there was so much liquid in the dish that my side of rice was not able to soak everything up this is not what i expected to see it was spicier than i expected as well  on the phone the restaurant said it was a little spicy i think the extra spice hid the fact that the dish was not flavorful it was almost as if the stir fry was done half heartedly and then water was added after the fact  maybe with another dish or dining in the food quality would be better im willing to give this place another try but i was not impressed with what i hadwhile i love chipotle for their fresh and healthy ingredients this location consistently disappoints on cleanliness every table is dirty as is the floor the trash is full and a few employees have been hanging out talking not doing much seems theres not a standard for keeping the front of the house clean which is not a welcome sight when entering or looking for a place to sitsecond time ive been here since it opened  this place is disappointing period  for a brewerytap house with the prices their menu demands whoever is running their kitchens doesnt have a clue  it is a dilemma to xhoose something from their menu that doesnt sound gross and a fourteen dollar cheeseburger is absolute robbery  as for the beer i didnt like any i drank the first rime so now im drinking iced tea  to the owners if you want to see a menu in your price range that doesnt suck go eat at brickhouse and steal the person who desined their menu  very disappointedlunch for 3 was almost 4000 my large size chicken w noodle dish had 4 tiny pieces of chicken in it and it was overcooked  the meal did not come with a smile none could be found among the entire almost angry looking staff  wont be going backthe good this brisket is so tender it nearly falls apart delicious base seasoning prior to cooking the smoked jalapenos are spicy hot and tasty  the not so good online ordering for carryout on their website is odd they list menu items with no price details and you cant click on them to select so they state for you call a central number to order for multiple locations 10 min later called by location to tell me the dessert i ordered isnt available there  was told order was ready arrived shortly saw my sack sitting there and quite a while before anyone acknowledged me then i had to wait too for her to get a manager to remove the desert they didnt offer  was given no choice of bbq sauce and they have 3 kinds  did not care at all for what they gave me the signature sauce  collard greens lacked depth of flavor mac  cheese was just ok  it takes away from the quality of the brisket to not enjoy the sauce ended up eating it plain  overall id call it a frustrating dining experience but there is no doubt they got the brisket seasoning and cooking perfectpancakes pure and simple is it really worth the wait on a monday morning was surprised to see the line the pancakes are good but they are just pancakesthough cooked within an inch of their lives the burgers were tasty the bacon on mine was crisp and delicious but the cheese noted on the menu as american cheese was nasty fake cheez whiz my companion ate all of his fries but i found mine soggy and greasy and barely ate half companions black and white milkshake was so thick he had to eat it with a spoon service was slow but i think they are still working out the bugs the ordertakercashier seemed overwhelmed having to take both instore and phone orders go on a nice day when you can sit outside as the tiny dining room gets quite cramped when a line forms for ordering i will probably try again but order ahead for takeout we were planning on their highly touted icecream for dessert but the line was ridiculously longweve been enjoying coffee at la colombe for many years but lately the baristas seem not to be trained properly  in the past my latte would be crowned with a 12 to 34inch layer of thick creamy steamed milk foam it would be so dense that i could run a spoon through it and it would leave a fairly deep trail   but the last several times weve been there there has been almost no foam  what foam there was consisted of a 116th to 18thinch layer  and it was thin not only in depth but also density i can make coffee with hot milk at home i dont go to la colombe for cafe au lait  this has been extremely disappointing   perhaps they are spending all of their energy elsewhere like the tv show or the newly opened shops hope someone in management wakes up and trains their baristas better or we will have to find another place to get our coffee fixthe food and the atmosphere here is great but not good enough for the poor service  be prepared to be here for awhile if you are coming to eat  the waitress did not ask for a drink order and every time we needed something we had to track her down    i am not a fan of a traditional mexican restaurant where there is not hot sauce or salsa on the table you have to ask for it and they charge you a 1i always have to be literal when i dont care for a place sadly this hooters was a disappointment they felt quite sterile and not a place to make your regular haunt beer is always a safe bet so points go there food tasted very preprepared and had chewy texture wings i used to go to the one off tanque verde in the 90s and it was great then if i were to offer advice to this franchise outlet it would be to go back to local sourcing other bars and restaurants are doing just that and they are amazingbased on 4 bowls of the pho tai we were not impressed  the broth was ok not as layered and flavorful as im used to    the side plates with lime were good except for the lime on two plates the end pieces with less juice than needed and the bitter liquid from the rind squeezed out too  but most disappointing was the rare steak  it was very tough and chewy not pleasant to eat two of our party left most of it in their bowls  one of our party kept casually listing all the pho places she knows that are better not intentionally slandering this place but saying what she preferred about other places which turned out to be everything  except the egg rolls which she liked a lot  the thai tea was good   best about the experience was the service all of the girls working there were great kind and helpful  im not going to have the pho again but will likely come back to try the banh mishould be 25 stars the menu sounds amazing but this places is hot as ballz and i dont mean in a cool way you will sweat your ass off upstairs the food was decent but too many flavors made the taste overwhelming fries are good but you will pay 2 bucks for each small jar of ketchup so pay attention ive eaten gluten free for 3 12 years and these were prob the worst buns super dry interesting experience with hipster vibe but ill prob never come backsave on foods my formerly favorite food store has completely redone their website i think that the purpose of this is to conceal the fact that they have drastically raised their prices while drastically reducing the value of their loyalty points after almost 30 years ill be saying goodbye to their great pharmacy and their wonderful employees i just cant afford them anymorei really really wanted to like this place after the good reviews triggered all my childhood memories of eating raw cooking dough and hoping i didnt get sick from the eggs lol  the location was a pain to find via my gps but once i found it the place is very cute  the service was very friendly and the prices werent bad but the dough was disappointing  some of the flavors were blander than i expected and the texture was just weird  kind of gritty and not the creamy melt in your mouth feel that i craved  maybe itd be better topped with ice cream or actually baked but i doubt ill give this place another tryas a boba milk tea addict from houston i always go out of my way on my vacations to try out the boba tea joints in different cities and sadly i was pretty disappointed by bings sure i dont expect a city like tucson to have amazing bubble tea but their milk tea was super bland unsweetened though i ordered sweetened and extremely watered down their tapioca was average in consistency and their prices are decent my friends ordered the taro snow too sweet and the peachapricot herbal tea also watered down unless a more authentic place opens up im afraid that tucson will never know how amazing boba milk tea truly isgood location on the santa barbara pier  being the shellfish company i was expecting pretty good food which i cannot say i found  we got fried calamari and something else oysters rockefeller  neither was too impressive  dont plan on returningive only been to whirled peace once and while the frozen yogurt i had was not bad per say they were out of about half of flavors so the selection was very limited i would say that kiwi or sweet frog is better but i also didnt get a flavor i would usually choose so it would be unfair to make that judgement it was right after the bike race so that may explain the lack of selection the service was good and the employees were friendly i will definitely be giving them another try and hopefully they will be better stockedwe checked out poblanos this evening  i cant say we were very impressed  im a huge mexican food lover but it seems like this place fell short  while waiting for our dinners to come i snacked on the chips  salsa  the chips were actually a bit stale  slightly damp  the salsa tasted good though  it had a strong cumin  tomato sauce base  there wasnt much chili pepper flavor to it but still it was decent  my dinner consisted of chicken enchiladas  the chicken was very rubbery  im not sure what causes that but i had the sense i was eating old chicken  the sauce on the enchiladas was totally boring  overall i was disappointedthis place is pretty expensive  i do not mind expensive  i frequent expensive places  i like quality too    this place is not quality  ive been here a couple times before writing a review because too many people whose opinions said great things about it  fuck that noise    ive found cocktails to be inconsistent each time i was there        the bartenders do not know how to make a good drink more complicated than 1 mixer and 1 liquor    im not a fan of the starters either  ive never had a full meal here based on the starters  first off theyre all pretty rich and decadent  sounds good yeah every time i tried theyve been over salted and if its hot a bit burned   its just another place for people in the neighborhood to show people how awesome they are    the older douche crowdi am actually giving this a 25 but that doesnt exist i tried this place because wood pizza was closed amazing place the atmosphere is very nice the inside looks like chipotle gone pizza crazy even the menu looks the same i was impressed with the interior the pizza selection is nice and the make your own pizza chipotle is a good option however the first thing i noticed was that the crusts are premade this is a big nono for me but i can understand doing this if it is necessary for the gluten free crusts not sure the process of making this they were very accommodating and allowed me and my friends to do 4 different pizzas on two crusts half and half we paid ordered some tap wine possibly a good idea depending on if youre looking to get smashed terrible idea if you are a wine snob the wine was fine but the price was 6 for a tester cup of wine half a 9 oz plastic glass so 45 oz i normally hate people who complain and moan about prices just get out if you are going to complain about reasonable prices for good food but 6 for this glass of wine was just absurd the wine was 1846 cabernet i mean i still bought it but im not getting another glass im just going to go next door to rouses and buy a whole bottle for 20 price of the wine served a 16 oz beer local craft was the same price so finally to the pizza it was not good as my friend first pointed out the chicken tasted frozen i agree the toppings were ordinary and there was wayyyy too much sauce in one of our pizzas and barely any on the other definitely not the worst pizza ever but not worth going back there is a growing trend in new orleans right now where restaurants think that if they look pretty they dont need to have good food this restaurant fits in this category shame shame new orleansas someone who loves mexican and knows how hard it is to find it in delco i had high hopes for sweet taco but was sadly disappointed the staff is friendly the atmosphere is nice and they have a bar but the good stops there  their menu is very short and you cant even get a chicken burrito  i got the roasted chicken tacos they had no taste who doesnt put cheese on a taco i had to douse it in their lime hot sauce to have any flavor    maybe id come back if i was looking for just simple chipsdip and a beer but otherwise will keep up the search for good delco mexicani usually go to petra express in new tampa but thought i would try this place since i was in the neighborhood i thought the food at petra express was much better crispy fries  moist chicken the fries here were not crispy  the chicken was a little dry the service at petra express is also friendlier  has a better atmosphere this place was absolutely dead at lunch time will not visit here again i definitely prefer the food service  ambience at the new tampa locationtried the 2 taco platter on an  chilly windy day in the spring  the food was cold and disappointing  the concept and flavors should be there but it was hard to get past the cold food  however did not care for the fiest corn salad  i was very disappointed but id be willing to try them again  next timethe seemingly popular curried sweet potato tacothis is supposed to be quick place to grab some asian food but it is slooooooooooooooow beyond acceptability  one person dishing food no matter how long the line is and one person at the register no matter how long the line is  this place need to hire a lot more helpsuppose you take 1 part pretentious hipsters 1 part great beer selection and 2 parts mediocre food options and grind it together yep thats the independent for you went 2 times and both were the same great locationi live down the street in that it is right off of 275 and a pretty good beer selection that is constantly changing run parallel to rude servers that feel the need to look down on peoplemyself and another i saw and pretty basic bar grub  i get that it is a spot for the cool kids  but maybe bringing it down a notch will help or maybe i am just out of touch either way the mermaid a little further north is a better bet for a drink in the heightswe went at lunch time and ate in the food was mediocre at best i got the honey glazed chicken and fried rice the rice was very dry the chicken was ok but not very flavorful also it seemed expensive for what i got we didnt have to wait long for our food though and the atmosphere wasnt bad which was nice probably wont go backthis westshore pizza is kind of like a high school class with a substitute teacher it seems like its just a bunch of teenagers running the place with little to no management one time i placed a pickup order and they lost my pizza after waiting forever to get the pizza they started looking around and questioning each other and no one knew where the pizza went delivery guy didnt take it but the cook said he made it got my money back and went elsewhere   i cant order online because my zip isnt listed on the website even though they deliver here   when i call for delivery and the person on the phone is answering 2 or 3 calls while theyre talking to me then i have to repeat everything i said because they were answering another line   the food is decent when you get it but it usually takes a lot to get to that point also there is no dine in at this location just take out and deliverynewer place went for the first time tonight tuesday night not very crowded had enough staff for a saturday the host station had eight people greeting us because they were obviously overstaffed our waitress overserved us checking on us every two minutes we ordered pretty quickly since we were getting so much attention since they had numerous cooks and not many guests our food was in front of us really fast my friend had the lasagna and i had the lobster ravioli after maybe ten minutes i was about halfway through my dish the waitress came and offered desert without even a chance to respond drop check and raced off we were the waitresses only table and she ran us out it was barley twenty minutes from walking in the door to check i feel we got the same type service we would have gotten at dennys or waffle house the food was fair to good not great id say olive garden would edge them out on food quality and appearance but not by much  we eat out a lot and i would have loved a new destination to frequent i wont say i would never go back because it wasnt terrible but when they had the chance to impress they missed   seesharpbeen standing here 15 min now three people ahead of us one ordering five subs and four pizzas line behind us one employee poor guy is behind the counter all by himself making subs running the register washing his hands making more subs    is it a good business practice to leave an employee all alone like this and at the dinner rush hourtried bonos tonight because my wife didnt feel like chicago style pie and we both are antiprovel cheese went to pick it up right around the time they said itd be ready and it wasnt no big dealabout the wait at least i dont know if its because they were rushing to get the order to me or whatever but when i got the pizza home it was a big soupy mess nearly all of the cheese slipped off of each slice as we pulled them out and took the sauce with it the crust was soggy and we had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork because it was too limp to pick up and eat   the flavor profile itself was okay not great not even particularly good but passable except it was well below the quality id expect for the price a 14 thick crust with 2 12 toppings and a crappy salad was nearly 30   speaking of the salad it was subpar even by pizza joint standards limp white lettuce topped with a few tomato slices a good smattering of onions and a whole mess of cheese the house dressing was fine but the blue cheese we ordered on the side wasprobably not blue cheese but not sure what it was it was a pale pink dressing that looked like it couldve been a vinaigrette except that it was gelatinous not thick like a blue cheese or ranch but like almostsolid jello the onions were fresh and crisp though  i gave bonos 2 stars out of 5 thats a tad generous its more like a 310 its certainly not the worst pizza ive ever had from a legit pizza place meaning a place that should be above pizza hut and papa johns level pizza but it might be in my bottom 10   bottom line we will not be back id rather spend 10 on little caesars than 28 on bonosjust an ok place typical soso food nothing to write home about  i ordered omlette fleur de lis other than a handful of tiny crawfish tails it is not that different from a regular cheese omlette for any diner in nj same could be said of potato and coffee not really worth the price tag   service is slow the waitress was busy chatting with another customer that i had to remind her that my food was ready and getting cold at the counteri normally go to starbucks every morning before work there is always a nice gentleman and an older lady with beautiful snowy hair there to make my beverage so normally i make an online order in advance simply because im normally in a rush this one day i decided id go in earlier simply because i was already out well the two people who normally served me werent there so there was this other heavier set girl with brunette hair there she questioned me when i was just waiting 2 minutes earlier i told her that i had made an online order but there was no rush and she goes well its not even that time yet so why are you even here with a nasty attitude which i didnt appreciate i told her i go there every morning with the same order she shouldnt have had an attitude for me being two minutes early especially if i didnt rush anyonei write this hesitantly because i am a beer fan and i want this place to do well we tried this place because its a cool new brewery and why not   i was really excited to try their different beers only to find that they were out of many of  them which means they didnt plan well enough to keep themselves stocked   the food was mediocre and that is based on trying the two sausage plate pork belly tacos and poutine the poutine was great in my opinion but the main dishes were lacklustre i wished more of the beers were available though i am a big fan of their saison the rest of the beers offered were just okay american pale ale and american sour wheat   also the server was slow to respond we had to keep reminding them of what we ordered and it was just not a great experience ive experienced better  on the pro side the place looked amazing i loved the modern decor they kept some of the original building features in tact like a bank vault in the mens bathroom and the lighting and ambiance was superb   i think this is a great place to come back and have a beer and a few appetizers and not so great a place to come to eat and be waited onwhole foods markets are very similar so you are probably not reading this review to see how good the supermarket is this store is new so it has all the bells and whistles but the reason why it well deserves a negative review is that the company badly miscalculated parking if you come in offhours no problem but at prime time parking is here is horrendous it is a total zoo and you can easily leave without a parking place to my mind for a new store that is an unpardonable sin you cant open a new suburban supermarket with inadequate parking and consider it a successin all fairness to wei hong my wife and i have ordered take out here numerous times during the past two years without any issues the portions are always ample and the food is usually very good   that said we ordered take out on saturday 21 feb and within five hours both my wife and i became very sick i was so sick i had to go to the er and was kept for several hours due to severe dehydration as a result of the sickness ill spare any readers the details   we called wei hong yesterday to inform them about this and received a less than contrite response needless to say i will not give this place any more of my money   i would urge anyone to exercise caution eating herethis place is much more diner than cafe ie not the cleanest place ive ever brunched  i ordered coffee and eggs benedict with hash browns  the coffee was typical diner coffee watery but okay the hash browns were good but super salty and this is coming from a girl that loves a well salted meal and the eggs benedict caused me the most inner conflict  the eggs were poached perfectly but a little on the wet side the hollandaise sauce was done quite well but the biscuit in place of the english muffin throws off the texture and to add insult to injury the ham they used was the super thin sliced lunch meat style ham which was disappointingthe bad ive been here 4 times but only ate here once because the place is never open at 11am like they advertise this is very unprofessional which is why they lost 3 stars open when you say you are open or change your hours the one time i did go and they where open was after work a woman was there and presumabley her kids where in the back playing she wasnt super friendly but just average customer service  the good the jerk chicken was awesome and the price was reasonable  overall delco soooooooooooooooo needs something else besides pizza and hoagie shops theres a thai mexican and now jamaican if you want good jamaican food and potentially have time and gas to waste its worth a trygreat cake as i love cakes with lots of icing sugar and their cakes certainly meet my needs here my soy latte was served warm and the barista was not happy when i asked her for a hot coffeeno wonder my venti mocha no whip tasted so weird it was a pike place with cream and splenda yuck should have checked the label when kid first tried to hand me a water i didnt order then he hands me coffee saying heres your white mocha which i didnt order and driving away and drinking it i thought man i havent had one of these in a long time my taste buds have changed   starbucksfailthey have a good reputation and their bagels and cream cheese are decent  i just think that they are a bit overrated  when i was there yesterday they only had 3 types of bagels the tables were dirty and there were no napkins  yes this was a bit after lunch but if youre a bagel place come on  i ordered a nontoasted bagel and cream cheese for there and got a dark toasted extra toasted bagel and cream cheese  when i said they needed to make me a new one two out of three people behind the counter argued over who was right abut the order  i told them to argue later and just make the bagel  i pretty much got it tossed at my head a minute later  oh well  if you go there please take notice of the menu board  half of it is marked out with white masking tape  thats pretty cheesy no pun intended  they make a mint from the jenkintown community so i am sure they can afford a new sign  pro good bagels and cream cheese con dirty tables had to clean on at least 3 visits lack of bagels charging 95  full price for day old bread and pastry parking lot old detritus such as event signs and newspapers everywhere  bagel slicer in package from the 80s for more than it would cost me to get one from bed bath and beyondi took a different route back to the office and found myself passing brodo  with the just opened signs in the window i figured it would be worth a try as they were likely still trying to impress their customers  i was underwhelmed at best  i ordered the vegan fetti salad ive been on a salad kick lately  its advertised as having mixed greens although my bowl only had spinach which im not always crazy about as the lone salad green  the other toppings were a bit sparse  for 749 which i personally think is expensive for a salad i expected more  i did not order the soup but i passed by the bowls on my way to pick up my salad and they did not look appetizing  if you have your food out where customers can see it you need to work on presentation  otherwise it was clean and the staff was friendly  i still think ill spend my money elsewhereive decided to update my review of this place it has to be the place to go according to legend and the best place to stand in line half the day waiting and looking at other fools who are staring at youbecause everyone had the idea because they read something legendary about this place please do tip well and enjoy the coffee and syrup buzz without even considering the idea that most people have eaten breakfast and are having their third beer by the time you drop your sausage as a result having the fasting shakesthe atmosphere was pretty boring no music was playing so it was nice that you could actually have a conversation it took about 15 min to get our drinks and only spoke to the waitress twice   it was neat that the drinks were served in beakers and science glass ware however there was just a lot of ice in the drink and not much actual drink i would return in a few months to see if anything changesi went with my son and we ordered the half and half chicken which is a mixture of 3 regular pieces and 2 sweet and hot pieces with fries  the chicken unsauced was a 45 for both of us and with sauce i thought it was a 35  my son gave it a 05wouldnt take a second bite atmosphere 25 bathrooms 15dirtiest i dont have seen other than a gas stationwhen i walked into rusans with my sister we saw a health inspector testing the temperature of the sushi with this metal stick he got the reading and pushed the plate of sushi back because the temperature was hazardous i thought this was a little unappetizing but i had heard so many great things about the sushi i didnt let it bother me that is until the inspector pushed all the plates back except for two i was grossed out but my sister was so adamant about the quality of the sushi so we stayed we had to wait half an hour for them to make new sushi for the buffet when i tried to talk to our server about the discarded sushi he shrugged his shoulders and said its not my problem the sushi was good but it wasnt worth the psychological torture taking each bite and thinking that food poisoning was a only a few hours away again the sushi was good but kens sushi is soooo much betterpizza was tasty food came out slowly one at a timewaitress was extremely rude and just tossed the food on the table as well as my check i found myself saying thank you numerous times with no response not really sure why i was thanking her clearly she was having a bad day just very unpleasant and unprofessional hire better staff  pizza was tasty kids meals were just frozen chicken and stale fries i just was not happy with the attitude for dining at the restaurantthey didnt have a sale today it was some kind of  bug flying around so me and my sister had to leavewe interviewed this caterer for our wedding the entire meeting consisted of them telling us what we wanted even though i said i dont like mushrooms i was told you dont but your guests will so well put them on the menu both my fiance and i left this meeting feeling a little abused the assistant in the meeting was really nice and seems like she would have been nice to work with however we received the quote and even after we told them our budget and said we were willing to alter the menu in any way to make the budget work they still managed to quote us double what we told them we could pay a friend of mine did sign with them then needed to cancel because she got hit by a car they refunded all of her money this was the reason we chose to interview them but we cannot work with a company that doesnt listen to us and we got that impression from themyou guys its just pancakes they are good but theyre not wait in a line for an hour good i just cant understand the hype about this placeexpensive for what you get  i had the 4 piece chicken platter can get better for less right up the road  also go the smoked bratwurst to go it was good but nothing to write home about  cant see a reason to go back nothing left me or the people i was with any burning desire to go back and have more of xwe came in and were quickly greeted and seated with friendly service  after a quick perusal of the menu and a few questions we ordered  antipasto first  pasta special wild boar over home made pappardelle as a firstpasta course and a rib eye for her and the rabbit for him  antipasto  diverse and excellent  a  pastafirst course one or two which were home made but all fresh the  special wild boar over home made pappardelle was savory with some wine noticeable would have liked more texture from the boar but delicious  a  after a bit of a wait we moved on to our entres not long enough to knock points off but long enough to start throwing the pacing off  her rib eye had a good char and was cooked nicely tough and dry though an insult to a rib eye  c  his rabbit fork off the bone tender something in the sauce i want crazy about something almost sickly about it  c  service was slow but very good a  atmosphere noisy and tight warm inside enough where we were getting antsy  c  appetizers and first course pasta were very good entrees were disappointing a mixed bag for us pre dinner a entrees c might have been better off with the boar as an entre pasta as a regular course seems a safer bet than their regular entres  one of the best in collingswood  not for usi really really wanted to like this place but i dont no at all i didnt like the atmosphere i didnt like my server and i hated my burger due to the cost and it really wasnt that good the burgers are bigger and better and half the price at mcdonalds 10 its an insult  as for the beer some of it was good not great i lived in germany for 25 yrs so i consider myself at least qualified to judge my son ordered a beer that was just bitter and almost undrinkable and he just graduated from college hell drink everything my wifes beer was just ok and mine was good for their flagship brew i really wanted to like this place too i live a couple miles from here and would like growlers filled here but dont want the beer  having said that i do like their tshirts and accessories  go elsewhere i amthis place is cute and the location is great but the cupcake i had was drystale overfrosted and tasted very artificially flavored  maybe the gelato is good but i doubt id go back to find outomg grrr two visits not one so im not just hitting them on a bad shift or picking the single slow cashier omg im standing in check out both times checkout took longer than i spent shopping slow is not the term reading a sign in front of methrees a crowd stating they will open another register if they see three people in line hah now my intelligence is being insulted like i cant count over three  whats four and fivenine  not even close i think i counted five or six each in the two lanes that were open at nine pm on a saturday nite the following day several lanes open but none moving two folks had bags of ice i wanted tell them it would be melted by the time they escaped the store  also be aware if you are visiting carpinteria theyve gone baglessbring your own bag but they were cool about that which is why they get two stars prices high but whats new at albertsonsyou knowwe use to love this place  and to begin with a positive their milkshakes are the bomb  seriously amazing although expensive  6 for a tiny large size  however the prices are soaring 1113 for a burger with no fries and the food quality and service have continued to decline  the burgers are overcooked and dry crumbling apart without much flavor  the nodijon please was ignored too  our fries were lukewarm but the special saucesketchups are nice  the service kitchen not the wait staff is getting slower than it use to be  youll want to have plenty of time to eat here  the atmosphere is hip and noisy  but im just not sure were up for another overpriced lessthantasty burger and meh fries  there are too many other fantastic burger joints for us to make the trek here again  i wish it were not so thoughok the oblivious smarmy and outright weird staff at the pastry and deli counters have finally scared me away  im done ive reached the breaking point finito throwing in the towel   ive been glared at ignored and skipped over too many times the middle aged lady with the glasses  well shes in my top 3 most annoying category and for the life of me cant figure out why she actually has a job here ohand whats with the overly friendly side conversations when im in a hurry blah blah blah  by the way hey deli staff  could you please not have your backs turned constantly and be attentive to the flow of customers i really dont like having to say excuse me  good grief is it that difficultthis store really has so many problems the employee stand around a just talk to each other  the one good thing about it is that the pharmacy staff at the time were pretty dumb if you dare to call in your own script you can do so with very little effort and great success i might add  it was all good until i got caught but it was good while it lasted 10325 viik lortabwe love this place however tonight on our anniversary my husband ordered the ribeye five minutes later he got a menu shoved in his face telling him they were out of it the guy next to us ordered the same thing after him and got it  terrible terrible service we ordered first he should have been the one eating steak not sitting here with a sad order of gnocchi  never againshakes are best part of expensive meal  the giant onion rings were bitter because they are not cooked enough to sweeten the onion  probably should be smaller to be more tasty  burgers are good but overpriced  my wife had the patty melt and when she can say they are better at steak n shake that is  problem  what they have going is an unusual combination of meats and ingredients so it is worth a try just to be able to experiment with something you dont usually eatshrimp gumbo had 2 shrimps in it and they were cold in the hot soup boiled fish had no flavor alcoholic beverage was great fernando was a great waiter but food sucked i wouldnt returnor recommend u waste ur time herejust got home the second time from wrong oder i got for take out then after going back to fix order the 4th count chicken strips i got is barely 4 not sure whats going on there but definitely not pleased todaythrough the end of the week las cazuelas is offering up any item from their menu for 7 between 11am3pm thats a pretty sweet deal dan and i stopped in here on a lunch break from work we picked up a few beers from the foodery and stopped by  the spot is tiny but nice there are about ten tables across the dining area with a small open kitchen the walls are brightly painted and there are several other endearing decorations i dont usually go crazy over atmosphere and one shouldnt expect anything from a place on 5th and girard but the decor is well done  i dont want to make a blanket statement about the service but here are two of my observations las cazuelas and the abbaye share some staff to my chagrin second my first choice on the menu wasnt available the last two were served moments before im not a restaurant manager but running out of a dish before lunch let alone dinner is finished seems to be problematic one plus are the free chips and salsa verde as soon as you sit down  the food came out quickly i ended up with a dish with rice and panseared shrimp along with caramelized mixed veggies everything was acceptable but i cant rave about anything the portions could have been a bit bigger dan went with marinated beef tips with refried beans and avocado he said that the meat wasnt the best cut and it marinade could have been improved upon neither of us could remark about anything other that the fact that we were getting a good deal for the money  for our drinks we picked up rouges chili ale which had a great pepper taste that didnt overpower it was a great way to start our meal we had the hot rock lager from port brewing to finish which was a solid but not outstanding lager  bottom line id prefer not to bash a place that is offering such a great deal i like the initiative to get in new customers but with a plethora of good mexican spots one of my favorites only a few blocks a way i cant see myself ever going back herenote this review is for lunch only  if you look up meh ive experienced better in the dictionary you would find the fountain on locust this place is not bad but there are dozens of places in the area where i would rather eat  i want to love this place and i do enjoy their desserts ive been here 4 times always with family members who love it but as a recovering vegetarian i rarely find anything appealing on their lunch menu their egg salad sandwich is loaded with mayo their cheese sandwich is kind of soggy and their birdseed salad is super sweet i had to ask for dijon mustard to cut the sugar in the dressing  each time ive been seated they have to ask if were ordering lunch the assumption however is that we are there for desserts this signals to me that real food is not their priority and from the reviews its obvious that their draw is dessert  after my last experience with just meh food i no longer accompany my aunts here for lunchits mcdonaldsthe staff was friendly and the order was correct thats about all you could review at mcds note this is in a part of town where low lifes hang out during the day so expect some panhandeling dirtbag to hit you up for some changethis is not for the grocery selection this is for the delisalad bar pre made selections conceptually this place is heaven for me lots of healthy options in a quick self serve buffet yeah not so much quantity doesnt mean quality the buffet food is never fresh pasta and rice is often crispy from sitting out too long and anything in a sauce has a film over it their paninis take 5 minutes on the grill and then when they come out the inside is still completely cold the salad bar is ok but 13 for a salad off a buffet i can sit down somewhere and get a fresh made to order salad served to me for less the community lunch tables in the back of the store are often dirty and not cleaned up after patrons finish their lunch ive eaten here for lunch 1015 times now out of pure convenience just hoping ill find something worth while but no such luckpretty disappointing experience i wanted an after dinner treat for the family but was left wanting  first the concept is do it yourself frozen yogurt sundaes you put in what you want and pay by weight so instead of getting what you pay for and then complaining about variations in that you pay for what you get so ok im with you so far   there were several yogurt choices from the standard vanilla and chocolate to red velvet which colors childrens lips like lipstick pineapple and coffee choices for everyone so again im with you but then the wheels came off  one the bowls are trough size so while frozen yogurt might be healthier than ice cream not in that quantity it isnt and there was no kid size so while my best choice would have been to insist that the kids shared or shared with me i did not want to fight that battle tonight so thats on me but kid size would be nice  two the toppings were poorly labeled and many including all the fruit options empty so while you can kind of tell what things are some of the spoons were labeled some were not and some were in the wrong place so this added a level of frustration when on tries to balance multiple feeding troughs of frozen yogurt and keep the childrens hands out of the candy pieces while ensuring that they cover their mouths and dont sneeze in the mms   and then it was a good thing i wasnt with the health department the tables were dirty toppings had been slopped around and yogurt drips were everywhere we wiped our own table to get a place to sit   the good news for me is that i dont live near here so im hoping for better results in btown but if you live near here be warned or at least lower your expectationsthis place sucks i dont quite understand what all the hypes about their coffee tastes like any other coffee and the employees treat you like shit i wouldnt go backwe came here after checking the great reviews on yelp however the place did not meet the expectation the seafood did not taste fresh and the scallops i took had a totally bland taste definitely not a good ratio of qualoty per money hope this is helpfuli am born and raised in chicago  i moved here two years ago and was very excited when they opened up the chicago staple harolds chicken  i have been here several times with the last time being the worst  we stood there waiting on someone to take our order  no one greeted us or asked if they could take our order  he just looked at us  my husband ordered a perch dinner with salt pepper and mild sauce its a chicago thing  we had to clean our own table with wet napkins in order to dinein when he got his food they were the smallest two pieces of fish i had ever seen  for ten bucks i expected a little more especially since this was not the first time weve ordered the perch dinner    im just really disappointed that they could not keep up the service and food they presented when they first openedi attended a wedding here on a friday evening in the courtyard  there were candles placed around the gorgeous fountain and the setting was quite beautiful  yet the fountain was not running  why  i can only assume because when they did turn it on close to the beginning of the ceremony it was leaking and the ground got wet  the reception followed in a banquet room tucked away behind several odd turns and at the end of an extensive hall  the room itself was long and and narrow and did not accommodate seating for the number of guests in attendance  i attribute this to poor planning on the hotels part  the worst part was that the food was not ready when the reception began even though the ceremony was 45 minutes late getting started  my guest and i were starving and had no place to sit  we left and went to a restaurant across the street to eatlove the chipotle chain but this one has variable quality on the food  i mostly get the bowls and chicken always comes out great  steak is spotty tonights was very chewy ended up giving three pieces to my dog  place is always busy definitely recommend online order and pick upunimpressed we went here based on the reviews but were very disappointed  its not really a restaurant more of a walk in shack there are only bar stools to sit on inside and its cramped you can sit outside which is nice but not what was expected  i had the coconut shrimp and they were just ok the shrimp had an odd metallic taste to them and the coleslaw was underwhelming my husband ordered the crab sandwich and it was completely bland we added some salt and it was better but still pretty flat the crab was all ground up and unrecognizable you would think a place touting fresh local seafood would use lump crab we both tried the chowder but it was thin and too salty a real bummer since we both love chowder normally  it was a 50 lunch and we didnt enjoy anything we had so it was a real let down while beef obradys is usually just a little short of horrifying this particular one isnt quite that bad sure the service sucks and ok there are minimullet sporting guys drinking tap beer at noon on a weekday but the buffalo chicken wrap is not only edible but decent  its pretty lame how they charge for every single little thing if you get wings they will charge extra for celery blue cheese and ranch each its not much but seems pettyi ordered a green tea latte it was only lukewarm when served we also had bagels with flavored cream cheese and the flavoring was so subtle we couldnt tell which was chive and which was jalapeo i wasnt thrilled and my husband said his iced latte was extremely weaklet me first say  i love urban juicer this review is simply due to the service at this location after a fun weekend of not grocery shopping monday morning i needed a quick coffee and smoothie to start my day i was the only one here around 740 am and ordered a smoothie and a cold brew with almond milk the person making my smoothie  was talking to their colleague and going extremely slowlike multiple pauses in adding stuff to the blender so they could finish their sentences if it was on a weekend day fine i wouldnt care being on a monday morning when its pretty clear im trying to go to work it was extremely irritating to add to the irritation when i finally get my smoothie i have to ask for a cup and almond milk to pour the coffee in usually when i visit uj in the arcade they are on their game and its ready in a whiz to add to this unpleasant experience when i am finally at work sitting at my desk sipping my not very well made smoothie i spot a hair at the bottom perfect i will probably not go back to this location and stick to the arcade as the arcade is clearly trained to handle people on the way to work and ive never seen a hair in anything ive ordered very average at best  we didnt try the wings which i think is their speciality but what we did try was nothing to write home about  we started with an order of ultimate fries which were described as being jumbo basket of fries smothered with 3 kinds of cheese cajun seasoning and topped with crispy bacon served with sour cream  the fries were crinkle cut and were barely fried  they could have stood a few more minutes to make them crispy and not soggy  the three kinds of cheese turned out to be massive amounts of canned cheese sauce which i didnt know was a kind of cheese and a little of a mixed cheese blend sprinkled on top  the cajun seasoning was missing  no site of it and no taste of it  then we ordered a burger which they claimed to be the best burger in brentwood  well there arent many burger joints in brentwood so thats not a huge claim  but i am not sure of any place in brentwood that doesnt make a better burger than this one except a couple of the fast food drive throughs and at least one of those makes a better burger  it was edible  it was food  it wasnt very busy for a friday night at 7pm  but that is about all i can give itthe portions were smaller than normal some management issues today got dirty silverware twice decided to wipe it down myself instead of asking for clean silver ware a third time the food itself was disappointing the sides were cold or bland or both my friends chicken dumplings were bland and mushy overall poor dining experience shape upive stopped by twice during lunch hour and they have had only one register open this is not fast food its slow food also today they had big red posters and signs up for specialty coffee and teas but when the person behind me tried to order one they were told oh no we dont have any of that this is the closest fast food to my job but ill be glad to drive a little further for quicker servicestill lagging in terms of delivery and service  the food is good if you eat in onlymeh maybe im asian so i dont quite get the fusionized taste but their sandwiches and teas failed to impress me also the staff wasnt particularly warm and i didnt feel at ease the entire time i was there the prices are steep for what they offer id prefer chinatown over this anyday  as a study place it is nice if you get a spot with an outlet and like someone mentioned previously the music sucks and i have to turn up the volume on my own headphones to concentratethey didnt have several types of bread available im stuck without food while my brother and fianc are eating she said i could wait 10 minutes but i would rather just eat at home instead of paying for food and not having time to eat with the people i came with the floors and the tables are disgusting temperature is too hot and theres only the one employee just not a great place compared to all of the other subways ive been tothis used to be my regular lunch spot until i got fed up with the turkey and brie sandwiches the honey mustard is carelessly distributed on the flatbread so the sandwich is very dry and tastelesswe had a very disappointing meal here  the hummus was flavorless and overly thick the lemon soup was overpowered with lemon flavor gyro meat was dry and the pita bread is not homemade finally the tabouleh was made of large pieces of tomato and cucumber it was lazy preparation lastly the meal is far from moderately pricedil posto is a very interesting concept simple fresh good food in a nice space  the food was tasty we had a tuna salad and a hero panini everything was fresh and good unfortunately the service is horrible  no hello when you walk through the door the gentleman who works the counter has an odd holier than thou attitude  they need at least one serverfood runner  the guy running the show has such a strange attitude that i doubt i will ever go back again  the owner who is also the chef was pleasant enough and they were pretty busy  i cant stress enough how rude and unhelpful the guy at the counter was  get over yourself brah a shame that the food was great because ill never go backpretty decent always has been clean and orderly found the specific bk to be quite noisy amongst employees very loud and boisterous stick to the drive thru although employees can be seen dancing and being very loud there too one wordurbanthe concept is awesome  the energy is very much alive  the market does fit well with the area  the issues  the prices are way out of whack for the amount of product quality and over all presentation  its like an airport they have a captive audience no other options close by so they gouge you on price  the only difference there are a lot of places to buy natural food in a fun atmosphere at much lower costs  well continue to walk around socialize but werere not buying until prices are equalizeddrinks are decent but expensive not many outlets to plug in phonetabletlaptop chargers also they always have the air conditioning on full blast in there its way too cold i cant stay there longer than a few minutes unless i have a jacket oni heard so many great things about this place and really was optimistic but was seriously disappointed i went during restaurant week and did the 3 course meal and it was just ok not worth the 30 bucks they were charging some under cooked phillo dough mushroom wrap and mediocre trout the service could have also been better not really diggin on overpriced foodplace is very over priced  staff doesnt seem very friendly everytime ive come in i have gone to the brooksville location and they seemed much nicer if youre looking for local raw honey check out murphys market way more local and affordablefollowed great recommendations and went for light lunch  thirty minutes for minestrone seems a little long but when the only relevant comparison is to campbells one wonders about the recommendations only saved by adding the pesto they served with the bread  perhaps a bad day everything else was fine if even if not remarkablewent to blackberry again for lunch today and noticed that the cleanliness level definitely was not where it should be  also they were out of one salad but none of the others  confusing how can you be out of one salad but not others  i mean they all have essentially the same ingredients and service was extra slow and it was not that crowded  hopefully just an off daythe bourse is a beautiful building inside and outside  but its just a glorified food court  nothing local its all mall chain restaurants  none are very good  youre not missing much if you skip the boursethis place is nice but certainly not worth all the fuss they use lavazza coffee which makes cafe bustelo look gourmet especially they way they brew it here the latte flavors including that used for the lavender latte is just monin syrup the chai latte is boxed tazo chai concentrate poured into a cup with some mediocre italian coffee for 4 it was meh   i sampled the torrone gelato it was creamy but too soft and the sweet flavor was lackluster    if youre in dunedin and youre desperate for coffee go somewhere else if youre in dunedin and desperate for a frozen treat then please go to strachans next door because that is some of the most fabulous frozenness i have ever had   i give this place two stars instead of one because 1 the service was great and 2 the place is immaculate so good job there frost  bean until then step up your selection and lower your pricesi havent gone here in about 6 months but ive been coming here since they opened we ordered some takeout today and noticed things have changed the prices have risen the portion sizes have dramatically decreased containers of steamed rice and beef with broccoli were only two thirds full and the food quality has also declined we will no longer be eating here because of thisi had probably the best sandwich ever here but the customer service leaves something to be desired the two gentlemen behind the counter were accommodating and courteous but the lady at the register was crude offensive and beyond unprofessional when there was a mixup over our order she stomped outside and yelled im gonna punch this bitch and other expletives to the customers dining outside for that reason alone i will never dine here again unless the management seriously reconsiders the individuals representing their brandwent over to subway last evening their were 2 employees in the store the guy was just standing their ehile the female waz doing all tbe work i went to the restroom 2 people in line same issue i left the storetried to get here the weekend it opened but the lines were very long second weekend no lines  brought my daughter to grab a chili dog and fries she liked the chili dog i did not but for 3 you cant expect much maybe avoid the chili  maybe avoid the cheese as well the cheese was something resembling cheese whiz but more gelatinous and transparent  the fries while abundant were soggy and tasteless the gelatin based cheese did not help the fries  i did like the lemonade though so there is that  if you are in a hurry best to stay away as the 2 chili dogs fries and 2 drinks had me waiting 15 minutes with no lines cost for all this happiness was 13 again  you cant expect too much at that price i will come back and try the ice cream as that portion of the menu seemed to be more popular than the foodwent this morning after hearing about it from friends most of the donuts were dry and tasted like a dunkin donut that has been sitting on the counter for two days the long johns tasted fresh and good but others were bad waste of moneyhorrible dont waste your time aside from there not being even average customer service tyemeka was talking no screaming into the phone as we were ordering the mac  cheese was old and flavorless the cabbage tasted as if sugar was added way too sweet and the greens and string beans tasted as if they were out of a can rice was average and the meatloaf was just ok definitely not worth the 2400 that we dropped the 3 wings in the large platter was tasty after waiting 15 minutes for it wow so disappointed while i tend to always patronize my own i will not returni know a lot of people like 5 guys but we were less than bowled over for me i guess it boils down to not being a frequent red meat eater so i could definitely take it or leave it lets just say that if im going to satisfy my onceamonth craving for a burger i probably wouldnt do it here   we waited quite a while for our food though the restaurant didnt seem all that busy on our visit perhaps they were just understaffed on that particular evening all in all i thought the food was okay but the burgers were still a bit greasy and overladen with condiments and the fries were nothing to write home about as far as im concerned im much rather have the fries complete with yummy dips at brugge brasserie   in the end even my meat  potato loving better half was not impressed and that says a great deal right there  i didnt think hed ever met a burger he didnt love until we stopped in here heres hoping this was just a flukei so wanted this store to be good one really nice thing is that the store is spacious unlike the former vons store there are no cardboard stands of goods blocking the aisles two carts can fit side by side in the aisles unfortunately it is expensive yesterday i tried going again and several products had no prices namely the butter which i went in to buy also last time id bought the haggen brand of ice cream only to discover later that the 4th ingredient on the list was corn syrup solids the haggen brand of cinnamon rolls had corn syrup and corn syrup solids i know sweet rolls and ice cream are hardly health food but why add corn syrup i ended up going to albertsons to buy the exact same items but for much less alas a pretty grocery store but much more expensive and not necessarilyy higher qualitynot overly impressed with this place considering they claim to have a legendary taste the bread is good but i cant say much for the rest of the sandwich i ordered a chicken cheesesteak and it was just chopped up chicken chunks with american cheese very bland in the taste they charge a little bit more than most local sandwich shops in the area so i guess i was expecting something a little bit more memorable i wont be in a rush to returnit is 7pm on a saturday night  if you want a snack no pastry for u   they are open two more hours and food case is completely empty and set for tomorrow   just see two ladies working  pleasant service but nothing above and beyond    they proudly post their 100 on tn food visit but store is not clean today pastry glass filthy and the front door windows look like cleaned with a dirty cloth   oh well the one up the street across the highway was a better experienceive been wanting to try livery for a while and finally went last night with a bachelorette party what a disappointment we had a reservation for 9 pm but our table wasnt ready no big deal we headed to the bar and ordered drinks our table opened up at 925 so we were good to go our server took our food orders first since we all still had drinks at that time around 10 we didnt have any food yet and it started to rain so we quickly moved inside they had a large table available that was able to fit all but 3 of us so we just stood for about 15 mins until i finally asked our server if they intended to bring us chairs so we could sit when our food came they brought us seats and we squeezed in at the table at 1020 one of our guests asked the server for a drink refill  because in the 55 minutes she had been our server she never once asked if we wanted more drinks she took her order and started to walk away i waved her back and said i think our whole table would like to order drinks our appetizers were finally served at 1025 an hour after we had been seated our drinks didnt come until 1040 20 mins after we ordered them our dinner was not served until 1105 then those of us with skirt steak had the smallest little portions and it was drowning in oil and butter we only had a few bites because it was so oily so bachelorette party two hours for late night dinner service server only got us one round of drinks more than an hour after we sat down completely killed the mood of the party we had been at tastings beforehand and had the most amazing service incredible fun and livery brought the whole night down we had 13 people to start only 4 ended up continuing the party the rest of us were sleepy and sober by then we will not be backi was quite excited to try this new burger place as i have been known to enjoy a good burger so i decided to give it a try today late this afternoon i ordered my food and found a place to sit down eventually i was called for my food and went to the counter they handed me the bag and went back to what they were doing i patiently waited and finally was able to acquire the soda which came with my order i sat down and began trying out the food      the first bight of my burger was amazing so i excitedly tried one of my fries much to my dismay tey had a very very funny taste to them as i had a few more i really began to have a bad taste in my mouth so i had a sip of my soda i continued savoring my burger and quickly forgot about the fries no big loss in bad fries right so as i went to take a third sip from my soda i realized that although it felt heavy it was already void of any soda i peeked inside only to find it almost filled to the brim with ice i went up to the counter and asked for a refill on the 2 soda i was told that it is their policy not to provide refills      that was it after fries that are now making me feel quite ill and a soda that was filled to the brim with ice and would not be refilled i cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a meal the only reason this place did not receive a single star is because their burger the signature mediumrare 500 degree burger was actually quite excellent          if youre looking for just a burger give the place a try just dont expect smiling servicei cant believe they havent remodeled this schnucks yet  it looks horrible inside and out  its just very out of date  however its close to work and sometimes i have to run in for something  their selection isnt as great as other stores around but it will do for the necessities  still beats the brentwood dierbergs though which is outrageously expensivetoday was an unplanned trip stopped in and got a few items to go again it was messy observed an employee cleaning tables appeared to be working on speed not quality many tables were not completely done yes it was busy but thats not an excuse for a complete cleaning job the food was meh fries were all small bottom of the bagnot the normal long nice size ive had so much better from this locationi was so thrilled to be able to get a great gyros sandwich when kalamatas opened some years back but the last three times ive been there 20152016 have been disappointing i dont know what happened the lamb should be heated  not the pita should be warm  not i had heard that the owner is no longer on site and gone to another restaurant fine except i think people currently in the kitchen may need more trainingi went here for the first time tonight after hearing good things from a friend and was decidedly underwhelmed we happened to walk in at just the right time  after we ordered and sat down the line to order was out the door and stayed out the door for quite some time   the menu is kind of skimpy but they did allow me to basically create my own burrito which i appreciated   however  we waited almost half an hour for two chicken burritos and two pork tacos it was ridiculous when we did receive our food i was unhappy to see that there was a serious lack of chicken in my chicken burrito and once i finished the burrito rice and beans i was still hungry is this where the donuts come in the line was too long to even consider getting back in although the donut selection looked decent for the price i wanted a little bit more substance  next time ill just drive a little farther and go to chipotleserver sat behind us chilling with her buddys while we could see our food sitting said there was only one person cooking but i can see three people back there bull shit service usually im not dissatisfiedwent once  not sure i would go back    i was hoping they really had some spectacular sushi after seeing the price of their buffet  i should have known better as after all it is buffet sushi      the buffet is very clean and they do have a good variety of asian dishes but nothing is all that great   you are better off going to a regular chinese buffet for half the pricei loved this place when it first opened  i went back a few weeks ago and it was like a totally different place the waitress was rude we were the only ones in there right at lunch time which was this first clue something had changed and the food was not the same quality or price  the menu used to be simple but now it was a little larger  it is really my petpeeve when places raise the prices but lower the quality of the food  my friend ordered a tuna melt and it was very dry she said  i ordered the quiche my favorite go to there which they were out of my first choice so i had to order one with meat instead  it was not the same as it used to be at all  it was dry and just blahhh   the waitress told us there are new owners so i guess that explained all the changes  if they want to survive i hope they change things for the better  i want small businesses to surviveall i wanted was a cup of coffee and i got that it was friendly service but the coffee was really bad and hence the two starsthe place is situated picturesquely at the end of the wharf friday at 230pm there was a 25 min wait to get a seat  service was fine the place has a cramped feel the food was sort of disappointing most people were ordering crab which is probably the best bed i couldnt resist the raw oysters and uni the oysters were good but no deal at 17 for a half dozen the uni was fresh and served on top of fresh scallop slices and a ponzo type sauce the sauce overpowered the uni sort of ruining it the clam chowder was good the lobster pasta that my dining companions shared was horrible it tasted like some poorly made pasta with some dried up lobster scraps met a glass of cheap chardonnay  not subtle nor simple just bad maybe try the crab if you go not impressedfood and drink are ordinary plus the attitude is very bad looks very impatient this place is owned by the restaurant next door wouldnt survive without it not recommendedthis restaurant is busy my boyfriend and i couldnt believe it we went in to get some takeout food and it was a cluster f it was so packed that they had people seated in the entry walkway wow you cant blame a restaurant for being busy although they should have just had a longer wait time instead of putting people in every nook and cranny the service wasnt great we waited over 20 mins to place a togo order and they never called when it was ready after 40 mins my boyfriend ended up waking in seeing it and grabbing the order we got home and we were ready for some bomb food it was okay nothing great overall go to this restaurant if it is slow and expect average food dont bother when it is busyfound this restaurant on yelp and were looking forward to trying it we must have been there on an off day as the food had zero flavor three of us went and we all agreed there was no seasoning and the meat was very bland we ordered the cuban the miami cuban and the roast pork sandwich the bread and meat texture were good although my husband felt it was too soft but im not kidding absolutely no flavor we asked for hot sauce and cuban sauce and added some salt to give it some sort of tastegood service but horrible food jacks new food truck series has to be the worst sandwiches i have ever eaten from jack in the box taste ok but for 5 a sandwich better load it up ive tried two out of the three and its horrible the pork belly in the blt is so thin they should be illegal to classify it as belly thick bacon is a better term and two pieces that cant fill the sandwich is a rip off then the primerib steak sandwich didnt even fill 34 of the sandwich once again failure last but not least they called the bread a baguette but its really just cheap sub bread overall id be ashamed to even market these sandwich as such i dont blame martha for not trying them jackvsmarthai really wanted to like west coast tacos ive eaten with them twice and have been underwhelmed both times its not that the food isnt good its just not as good as you hope it is i get the whole korean bbq menu i just think a taco should be more than tortilla meat and an ounce of green onion ill keep trying to find something i really like from these guys but only when its parked in a super convenient spoti was not happy with the food everything was either really burn or under cooked not worth going backi eat at chateau cafe most work days and have decided the food depends on whose doing the cooking it has to be one day ill have something great the next its terrible i use to have chicken tenders every day until they change the breading on the tenders theyre terrible and gritty today i had a fried shrimp caesar it was awful most of the romaine lettuce was limp and there was more yellowbrown lettuce than anything else the shrimp were under cooked my stomach is flipping just thinking about it i wont be eating there againi am so disappointed  after reading reviews for this place i was expecting so much  i ordered the beef brisket  you know how white turkey meat can look and smell delicious but you almost choke to death trying to get it down because it is so dry  that was the brisket they served me  the portion was laughable  what is the one thing all southern bbq places have in common  ridiculously generous portions  the portion i received would have been perfect on a kids menu  the lowlight of the experience was the 8 stale potato chips they put on the platter  the coleslaw earned them one extra star as it was very goodi am giving the place 2 stars and i wanted to love it  i believe they will get better with time and i will update my review  for now the food was fair but they also added oil on all sandwiches which were pre made and the price was too high for what you get  the prepared juice was unremarkable once again i will go back soon because the place is really nice and looks like a cool place to hang out  i am hoping they will get better with time and become more competitivelove the original tired hands location and i loved the fermentaria up until this point  my husband and i were coming back from the city and wanted to stop and have a drink  we saw they had a taco special up until 10 pm  we arrived at approx 940 pm and wanted to partake into this deal because the tacos are amazing  we seated ourselves and waited for the bar tender who was neglecting us  it was a monday night there may have been 10 people in the whole place  he finally came over at 958 pm to ask us for our drink order  we asked if we can still get the taco dealhe looked at his watch and said i guess and told the kitchen our order  the kitchen is an open kitchenthe chef basically flipped out for our order and was pissed  a i get it its late but the deal was up until 10 pm our bar tender was neglectfulblame him  the chef made us feel like assholes for ordering because he looked at us from the kitchen with attitude  b im sorry but we were sitting therefor at least 15 minutes before we were waited on by your bar tender in a nearly empty restaurant  we tried to get the attention of him as we saw no one else was eating and you were starting to clean up for the night but you are also open until 1 am we saw  c  dont make your customers feel like they did you an injustice or did something wrong  if i had sat down and gave insults to you and the foodservice out the gatethen fine  but we were just trying to grab a late night bite that you had advertised and not just  a good beer but a james beard nominated beer  we use to live in ardmore and we were one of the first people to become tired hands fans with the opening of the first location  we couldnt believe that a place this good could exist in the main line  i was very insulted and disappointed tonightthe food is 5 stars as far as fast food goes customer service is normally top notch the reason for my lowered star review is because today my 3yearold slipped and fell backwards on her head because of careless employees who couldnt mop and dry properly what made things worse is they didnt stop there careless actions until another young child boy slipped and fell on the other side of the dining area  near where they were mopping it wasnt until that point that they decided to wring out the mop so it was less wet and easier for the person behind to dry because of their careless actions two small kids fell thats not ok in my book and we didnt even get an apology or anyone to check and see if my child who was upset and crying was okehhhhhh food was ok tiny portions there was literally five normal size tortellini on the plate 5i had the slinger and all the flavors felt off  just not impressed this is one of those trendy places that puts metro food on their menu but doesnt do it righti actually really like this place they have an amazing variety of bagels and cream cheese spreads however sometimes they are so stingy with their cream cheese where im literally eating a bagel with a thin barely there layer of cream cheese and anytime i ask for the spicy veg cream cheese they always do half spicy veg and half plain or half jalapeo or half something   if i wanted a mix i would ask for it im not sure why theyre so weird about it and i dont even know it happens until after i leave if im paying for a service i expect to be given what i asked for its happened multiple times and i wish i could say im gonna just try one more time but i think im over it  no i havent tried to talk to the people behind the counter about it because i didnt think i needed to especially when im directly telling you what i want   good place over all but im wasting my money here by not getting what i wantwhat huh eh   as much as i love the mass ave location this spot was a huge turn off so loud so suburban i hadnt been to this area in years and its freaking weird  i guess if i gave up and split for the burbs id give it another shotbad chinese fried rice was not good mushy and pasty  kung pao was okay but sauce was runny and thin hot and sour soup lacked flavor dont botherwhen in the 2nd stlombard area while dodging the wawa drunks be sure to also stop in at cosior not  cosi seems to be taking over philly even more than starbucks  why  why do people rave over this stuff  great so they serve everything on this supposed manna from god known as flat bread  it aint that killa kids  whats wrong with having some substance to your baked good in which you sandwich your food of choice  the prices are stupefying for fast food  eight bucks for a samitch served with either baby carrots or a crummy bag of chips  sheeeit  i can go to subway and get a five dolla sub and a big ol drank and good chips for less than the same deal at cosi  and whats with that weird ass coffee bar  this place is so schizo  it comes off as a joint that would have been inhabited by the types who would have frequented the old playboy clubs and smoked pipes and drank old fashioneds had it been around then  its swankness is undercut by its sheer averageosity  i can never finish a samitch here because its so underwhelmingthis restaurant used to be good but now the food is very average and the man that waited on us recently was so rudehe acted like he didnt want to be bothered doing his jobit is just not as good as allegro  the owner apparently trained in the same place as the owner of allegro however the execution falls short  the flavors are not as good nor is the service  they only offered mixed flavors on medium and above  just go to allegrosi got a giftcard to this restaurant for christmas and as my mother and i had both heard good things id thought wed give it a shot i knew the restaurant gets packed on friday and saturday nights so we went on a sunday night there was a healthy amount of people and so there was some wait time a little more than i think there should have been honestly  the menu is pretty decent all the standard texmex fair burritos enchiladas quesadillas etc  mostly meat based but there are plenty of options for vegetarians as well the decor is warm but super hipster and trendy i appreciated it   sadly all the food we had was lackluster i had a chicken torta which was alright except for the very blackened chicken which i never really enjoyed my mother got a steak enchiladaburrito concoction which she didnt enjoy too much and from what  i saw appeared to be more peppersonions than anything else  honestly i wont be going back here its just not worth itfirst love the concept of bff caf the concept is long overdue and sorely needed   i tried bff a while back on a monday and found out there only do fuel packs which is take and heat at home and or you can heat up there that didnt interest me so i said i would be back   i arrived today and was excited to eat here as i tried a small sample at a yelp elite event yee i ordered at the counter with a younger gentlemen and it wasnt busy to me 1 guy waiting and 2 people already eating and 1 couple behind me   i asked what to order as i was really hungry and the gentlemen right off the bat said the bison burger 16 without skipping a beat i rarely eat bison and i was craving what i had at the yee and next he said paleo hunter zoodle either one was super filling   total for food was 3 for cauliflower fingers 12 for the paleo hunter zoodle a full check plus small tip was just over 17 thats wout a drink i consider this a high price point for a lunch   i thoroughly checked over restaurant something feels missing here not sure what best describes my best interpretation is its feel like an empty cafeteria order here fill your drink here get condiments over there and bus your table basically no service order and just wait i had a number on my table and the food comes out a bit slow considering there was 1 order in front of me and i think the dish i ordered much of it was premade like braised beef vegetable noodles etc   my dish arrives and it looks naked i only ate a sample at the yee so i didnt know why it felt naked but i felt like there should be a sauce over it or on the side as it looks very much naked i was quite confused because my cauliflower c fingers had a salsa side i tried the c fingers first as its my guess is its the c pizza cut into strips to make the fingers i had enough salsa for about half of them and it was okay kind of cool to be able to order a unique side but wouldnt need to order it again as the flavor was okay to below okay not enough c for me also no notations on nutrition on this dish nor other handhelds   i am looking at my main dish the paleo hunter and again it feels so naked i start thinking about what sauces i can add to it but nothing looks like a match but i did notice a wasabi in the cooler when waiting to order and thought if its real wasabi that might give it a bit of flavor and heat and at least add much much needed moisture to this dish that looks like it needed something to blanket please note i did ask cashier who said it was okay to grab the wasabi dixie cup from the cooler    i added the sauce very carefully and then being a professional salad tosser western village steakhouse from 1994 i tossed my dish expertly and thoroughly in case the wasabi was super hot which i was hoping it was it was not i started eating the dish and the first i notice it was below lukewarm in temperature it was just between cold and luke warm i was quite confused   i spent only about 23 minutes eating the c fingers so that couldnt be it the wasabi from the cooler was about 15 oz dixie cup carefully poured to cover the dish why was my dish almost cold maybe thats how they do it here its a unique place serving unique maybe they dont want the nutrients to cook off i wasnt sure but then again i really didnt want to just eat it and assume so i waited to talk to the cashier who really just takes orders and gets food from the back but all of the sudden it took over 5 minutes and a phone order to get his attention   i said should my food be almost cold he said yeah maybe because it didnt sit under the heat lamp that long i was still puzzled so i said how was it cooked he said on the stove i was was still puzzled his answer was that yeah if it goes from the stove to the plate to your table that happens okay i decided to eat the food as it was and as i did i realized i was never eat here again so its really simple just eat leave and a solid review to let my fans know the biz i want to save you  if you value it   again love the concept of bff but based on today experience this place is not for me last but not least as i was relaying the story to coworkers because you know the power of a bad experience you usually share 10x and a good experience 1x i remembered looking at the menu and then i remembered being at my yee event that this dish is suppose to have a blanket which today was missing and that is the chimichurri sauce that was another aha moment of the terrible experience i had today   last note the cashier told me that they had a big rush before me thats why the food didnt sit under the heat lamp long enough to warm up the food i guess that big to go order before me really stressed the chef the guy sitting down that i saw leave with a bag of food probably for a family of 23 adults and 23 kid thats pressuredecent place for food cheap and the quality is okay but the wait for the food is absolutely unbearable it took them 40 minutes to make a chicken quesadilla wrap which is normally a 3 minute process however i did get to bond with some other customers because they were also waiting for over 30 minutes not worth the wait in my opiniontried this place a few days after opening id get into a lengthier review but everyone else has taken care of that  imo 5 guys is far and away the best this burger was very dry and not very tasty fries are ok i think when all the hype dies this place will be forgottenthe staff were friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant was fairly good the problem is i got cheese fries to go and when i opened the box it was just plain fries no cheese  i basically paid couple of extra dollars for nothingi really tried to love hipcity i really truthfully did however every single time i come by to give it another chance and purchase a groothie its always lukewarm and doesnt sit right with me or my coworkers whats the deal hipcity   ill give it another try the next time i come by hopefully this wont be a disappointmenti was a bit disappointed ordered the spicy beef soup and it wasnt hot or spicy enough the soup had a flavor to it i didnt like their iced tea was great like that you can customize flavors the place is very clean and the staff are friendly i would go back just for the teacute place with nice patio but thats about all thats good i waited for my friend for about 10 minutes no one even came over to offer a drink or water for that matter way over priced for what you getthe hot coffee was on the lukewarm  i dont  think this was a fluke since all the selections were this way  ate a bun that had nuts and a hard carmel on top  flavor was good but the carmel was  cooked to the candy stage and was impossible to cut with a knife   ambiance is mellow and the dining area would be great to meet groups of friendsehh its definitely good when you finally get your order last time we came they gave us fries instead of riceon top of taking 20 minutes today we have been sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes they just finally acknowledged us and we are still waiting cannot wait to to find a decent jimboys somewhere in reno   and were still waitingi walked in with my husband on a friday afternoon after the auto show i was so excited to experience the burger and service at the range i ordered the blgt burger the side of chips was a necessary add as all of the tables were eating these delicious looking fried side items i ordered my burger well what i received was a cold well done over goat cheesed gloppy burger my husband was underwhelmed as well with the traditional the chips are fantastic   i will try again because i try everything 3 times to make sure i hate itbecause its so darn close my husband and i have been here several times and i must say weve been progressively more disappointed which is why im writing this review unless you plan on dining at pk in the 500 hour its very crowded and loud to the point where we have to shout to hear each other across the table so much for intimate conversation another thing we have noticed is that we are treated differently if one or both of us orders an alcoholic beverage were not big drinkers and when we choose not to have beer or wine with our meal we shouldnt feel pressured to do so in the hopes that well receive better service a classic example the last time we were there our waitress was visibly disappointed that we werent ordering drinks and told us that the kitchen was backed up about 30 minutes and that it would probably take a while for us to get our food we waited for a little while and the waitress came back once or twice to see if we wanted anything from the bar until my husband finally caved and ordered a beer wouldnt you know it  the waitresss attitude changed and our food came out about a minute later how convenient finally a note about the food weve been with pk through a few menu changes now and the latest menu revision is very disappointing they got rid of our favorite items on the menu  the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the parliament burger the menu offers a roasted pork sandwich which is supposed to be a spinoff of the kind youd get at dinics in reading terminal but it fails the only burger choice is now the 18 burger churchill i think probably due to the fact that when they had 2 burger choices im sure more people ordered the 14 option clever speaking of the new pork sandwich and burger just a headsup they will ask you if you want a salad or fries even though they charge you extra for the fries a fact that they fail to disclose when you think you actually have an equal choice i think the bottom line for us is that we dont really have a reason to come back here for a while between the disappointing menu and the tacit pressure to order alcoholover priced for the quality for this reason i didnt tip akira is way better the price is a little cheaper and you get more for your buck the waiter was bold enough to  come to my car and ask me why i didnt tip that is so rude she asked me if the food was bad or something  i wanted to be honest but i would be hurting her feelings if i did that  she made me feel uncomfortable the entire time after she walked back in i guess it was the manager or whoever he came to the door and began to stare at me like there was a problem  i will never go to this  dead restaurant again  i see why its so dead there the food was nothing to go crazy for and it doesnt help that they have rude staff thumbs downtrivia fun  food decent although i like their beer selection and buffalo sauce  service had a tall order to keep up with the good trivia crowd there was about 6 good size parties but i came in at 800 and was served my food at 920 after ordering at approx 830 no apology just a defensive manager that gave me a military discount for my troubles of waiting close to an hour for my food im estimating  im military when they picked up my check with their 20tip in cash she laughed down and dirty thats what happened we bring a group here every wednesday and this service was not acceptableoverpriced and not worth the hype the food is okay but nothing i couldnt cook at home i dont enjoy spending 15 dollars on a meal if i dont leave full and im not wowed by itsubways are generally pretty solid and i would give them 3 stars overall as a chain due to their healthy options  however some locations are better than others and this one is the pits  the space is tiny and cramped so if youre looking to eat in the subway you might want to get it to go  the sandwich bread and ingredients werent as fresh as ive had at other locations either and they certainly skimp on the fillings  but the main reason this subway gets 2 stars is because the service is terrible  the two employees were incredibly dour and unhelpful and acted simply disgusted to be serving my girlfriend and me maybe they just dont like samesex couples  i dont go to subways often but i definitely wont be back to this locationthey really are strange definitely something you have to be in the mood to eat their pbj donut is great but the gooey fruit loop topped and cake based are not good the actual donut is really dryfood was okay  their only salad dressing had little flavor and their spicy chicken sandwich was deep fried and dry  however the sevice was exceptionalin full disclosure i really enjoy going to pei wei for take out  i dont get to go often but when i do i really look forward to it  i was happy that my wife suggested take out at pei wei but after my meal disappointed is the only word that came to mind    my wifes noodle dish was average but my pei wei spicy was well below average  it was dry and tasteless  it tasted like the meat was reheated and they forgot to sauce the rest of the dish  i also had ordered extra vegetables but i could tell there was nothing extra    hopefully this was a one time occasion otherwise pei wei will be off the listhorrible experience all the dim sum was dried and cold the waitstaff was like their dim sum my sister really wanted good chinese food and we found this place via yelp disappointedi recently moved to st pete from nyc and at first glance i was excited for a great healthy smoothie 14 for a smoothie and 5 for a coffee those prices are ridiculous compared to nyc the coffee was regular drip not some artisan coffee the smoothie took 30min to get because the staff was too busy talkingive been coming to josefs for years and today i decided i will never return between the consistently shitty service the incorrect orders the lukewarm at best food and always moldy tasting potatoes i have lost all my love for josefs to add insult to injury the last three times i have dined at this restaurant within the past month sonja the owner is sitting on her butt being no help to the frantic servers or the obviously over run kitchen i hate writing this review but i hate poorly run businesses more please please get your act together josefsthis was my first time ordering from this place i read all the reviews and it sounded really good unfortunately i was highly disappointed  i ordered the cheesesteak with fried onions with a side of  tomato soup  i also ordered the macaroni and cheese the cheesesteak was good what ruined it was they put black pepper all over it i dont like black pepper on my cheesesteaks  the tomato soup was horrible it had taco spice in it or cumin or something like that i dont like southwestern spices unless im eating a taco  the macaroni cheese was the biggest disappointment absolutely no flavor who is rating this stuff high stars people who obviously dont know good food it was nasty i threw it out   will never order again from them ill stick to  tony sopranos pizzathe hot spot stopped my companys headquarters for lunch today and i was not impressed  im somewhat of a fried chicken snob  if i were on death row fried chicken would be my last meal  anyway im not a fan of hot chicken in general  i took a bite of a coworkers twisted chicken wing and decided to give the chicken a shot  it was good for one bite but as i ate more i found it to be overly salty from the pseudo jamaican jerk seasoning  the sriracha was a nice touch and i probably wouldnt finished my chicken if not for my sriracha addiction  the fennel cole slaw was good and definitely helped cool the burn from the chicken  i also sampled a few other items from my coworkers  the fries were hand cut on the truck which is a little different  however they were soggy  im not sure theyve discovered the technique of twice cooked french fries  the chicken melt was the best thing i had  it was like a patty melt reuben and chicken sandwhich had a baby  one other issue i have is there are not lighter options on the menu  i get itif you are a health freak dont eat at a food truck  however its summereveryone has their beach bods in order  its 90 something degrees outside   we need something other than burgers and fried chicken  i havent tried many of the food trucks around town but would have to imagine there are several others with better options and better foodwe were at international plaza and decided to give this a try since we like sushi a lot the conveyor belt idea is fun but annoying since you have to identify everything sailing by by looking at the menu by the time we identified it it was long gone a gimmick that doesnt work for me the menu is terribly annoying because there are no prices next to any item just a color coded bowl so for every item i had to look back at the legend over and over again  portions are small but that can be good or bad depending on your point of view i felt like the value for the money wasnt there  just not for mei keep wanting to love this place but i just dont the food is ok at best pulled pork is decent pretty moist but could definitely use more smoke brisket is good especially the fattier pieces but again lacking smoke the burnt ends are mixed with pork not traditional not a fan the mac and cheese is absolutely terrible the cheese has a gluelike consistency and and is just very unappetizing not to mention theres a sort of sourness to it as im eating the baked beans my opinion changes dramatically from start to finish i loved the rich sweetness on first bite but by the the time you get to the last you realize they are way too sweet as they start to resemble some sort of candied baked bean made by willy wonka himself all in all theres too many staples that they dont get right in my opinion lastly butter does not need to be refrigerated when someone asks for butter they want to be able to spread it on their bread they dont want a rock hard piece of nearly frozen butter please take it out of the fridgetypical black owned restaurant good food poor service  they opened their doors with an extremely long wait for food but youd think they would try and correct this problem no a few years later and the wait for a platter is still 2535 mins if youre lucky so the next step is to call ahead well youre out of luck on that to their phone takes you to the answering machine  it tells you they dont ck it so youre forced to go to the restaurant and wait the ridiculous amount of time for your food and this applies to both locations  but heres one for the ages on pope saturday both locations  which are in primarily black communities close for the pope no sign on the door people inside but too ignorant to come to the door to say anything  i know theyve lost lots of  bec of there lack of caring about their patrons  time but the no taking orders on the phone and closing early wo notice or even a sign on the door is fcuked up and plain lazy unfortunately they think theyve made it but as ive said in the beginning typical blacks owned restaurant good food  poor service   i dont know if their bs is worth itfriendly  fast service  ordered cheese curds wheres the cheese only fried batter super disappointingif pancake pantry had the efficiency of mcdonalds i might recommend it as it stands though waiting for an hour or so for breakfast from this place is not worth it   parking sucks pancakes can be found elsewhere that equal or best them in quality and certainly in price service is not that great   the only redeeming dish at this place is the homefries ill let you in on a secret though theyre easy as hell to make quarter some potatoes and boil them when cooked thoroughly drain and dry heat a ton of butter in a skillet throw the potatoes in and smash them slightly with a spoon fry until golden eat with ketchup the same or slightly better than pancake pantry   let me repeat do not wait in line you will be disappointedbefore my last visit i quick tipped this business as a great asset to our neighborhood i may have jumped the gun it has a long way to go but they are still fairly new so i am sure they are suffering from growing pains  first thing that we found distracting is the big cooler in the lounge area find it a new home it ruins the ambiance that you have created and it is a good feeling secondly dont down grade yourself with the robert mondavi  woodbridge table tents your serving quality wines and everyone knows woodbridge does not fall into that category   the staff is friendly and provides good service but while we were there they seemed to be over staffed and falling over each other  theyve decorated well for the holidays and i love the heated front patio and the fire pit in the back patio   ill revisit and i am sure theyll pull it together so i can upgrade my  of starsthere are plenty of veggies and fruits here but not the best quality  we always walk in eager to get a bunch of stuff to hold us over until a trip to reading but the quality is just not there  you can find grapefruit tangerines various types of apples etc bok choy baby carrots spring onions regular onions and potatoes tofu and a small section of various asian ingredients  they even have hummus and olives  if im in an emergency like i just ran out of shin ramen and i must have it to nurse a really bad hangover i would stop by herelets talk about how quickly i like to get my coffee i dont even want to have to think about the time it takes one cold brew and one decaf coffee 30 minutes on a friday at 11am what  when asking if the had decaf coffee the cashier told me yes of course 20 minutes later the barista tells me theyre currently brewing the decaf coffee maybe a little warning on the fact that i was ordering an unprepared item would have been nice 10 minutes later the decaf coffee tastes like a mad crazy cup of regret of both time and money oops   the cold brew was fine but definitely nothing special i honestly would rather just get iced coffee at steins next door tastes a million times better and is 30 minutes faster   however the donut gains a little respect still nothing special but not bad and slightly enjoyable so a star for the vietnamese coffee donut that i got that was a little fun but could still use a bit more flavor props to the tapioca pearls in the center though crafty  will i go back on my own again probably not within the next year would i go if someone asked me to yeah maybe everyone deserves a second chance rightreally wanted to find a good sandwich shop aside from the great cubans around town but have to keep looking  the sandwich was just bland  i cant say ive ever had to add salt because of a lack of flavor to anything involving a subuntil now  even worse it was the chipotle chicken which should have been packed with flavor  if that one was that bland i would hate to see what the turkey sub is like  free baked potatoes after 5 but honestly that doesnt do much for me yet alone make up for a substandard meal pun intendedthird times a  well i wanted it to be a charm but it was another dud  i really wanted to like pub and kitchen since i live two blocks away and thought that something a little more trendy would be a nice addition to the graduate hospital neighborhood  ive been there three times now and had dinner and drinks each time  the food has ranged from barely edible to decent but certainly nothing impressive  i could put up with okay food if the atmosphere was welcoming and i still saw the value but with the noseintheair attitude and prices equivalent to some of the nicer rittenhouse restaurants i dont see any reason to return to pub and kitchenthe only reason this place gets a 2 is because the beer was really good i set at the bar and watched both of the waitresses shot a beer while i waited to be served finally the bartender waited on me and he was really a smart a drank the beer enjoyed it and moved onobviously poorly managed base on the employees drinking before the customersi dont mind fast food restaurants and i generally dont have high expectations but as one who expects decent customer service this location falls short every time i have come here i have provided myself with an excuse that maybe it was late they were tired or even just finished with a rush that would leave them grumpy however this time around it was unnecessary the service is mediocre and the staff was absolutely rude if you can go to another jack in the box in the area i suggest it because you will just leave here in a bad mood and that my friends is not worth the 899 i just spent on the foodits not about the money but when the menu on the board says 250 for a capuccino and the price magically changes to 440 when you order it to go its misleading the barista says its because it becomes a latte price i dont get it he should forewarn the orderer the espresso wasnt that good anywayg to the h to the etto  what the hell  i felt safer on secluded 7elevens in the abandoned streets of bangkok or hcmc at three oclock in the morning  i felt like reno 911 was coming by at any moment to take me away in a body bag  anyways dont go here at nightfeels freaky to me and i like to venture out into danger  im sure things are different in the daytime  this place doesnt have much of a selection anyways  the place isnt well lit at night  the redbox wouldnt take promo codes  the food items looked iffy  the employee dude was cool enough though  maybe i gotta come back in the daytimemaybethis review pertains only to the saladdeli section  my wife and i eat at whole foods at least once or twice when we travel  so the ritual continued when we visited reno  the salad selection was usual but rest of the section was just plain bad no meat except fried chicken the chinese food was so cooked they started to turn brown and stale  the mexican food section also looked pretty dead  of course poached salmon was missing  we ended up going to a restaurant with luck we spent less money and got better foodcupcakes were okay i got red velvet and a gluten free chocolate cupcake the service however was poor i walked in and the young girl who was working didnt acknowledge me there was nobody in there so it was a little awkward finally i asked what type of chocolate ones they had she said they were out no other suggestions were made and the i pointed at the cupcakes that were sitting on the side of the wall and asked if they were chocolate flavored and she said yes theyre gluten free uhhm okay then i mentioned that it was my birthday month and that i saw their website displayed a free cupcake during your birthday month and she did confirm the special but added that she did not know how to process that she didnt try get any help or even offer to have the owner call me i ended up paying for both cupcakes im not sure ill be coming back hereapparently im the only one in town that thinks the taste was made for children wheres the flavor cheese tastes weird and it seems to be burnt ive had it a few times when it was offered at friends housesi found an animal hair in my fries disgusting the chicken burgers was ok nothing special or good just fineafter waiting in line for over 20 minutes they told us they ran out of burrito tortillas not something you want to run out of when thats what you predominately servei didnt really think much of this place it was pricey but thats to be expected of markets in the city   what surprised me was the lack of higher end products it seemed to be filled with a lot of regular items which is fine for a grocery i guess but with higher prices id expect a wider array of higher quality goods to match the price all in all i wasnt very impressed with the selection of productsfrom outta town we did a take out order we ordered a lot they forgot soup and our bags of chips  i asked her repeatedly if we got everything and j should of checked myself but there was 3 huge bags and i had 4 hungry guys with me   by the time we got to the hotel and gave the stuff out we realized and we were too far away to come backvery unusual for a chipotle  all but one server attendant was unmindful they kept talking among themselves instead of serving the folks in linemy second and last visit the yogurt is great but a gift card i was given wasnt honored even though i had the activation receipt when i paid with cash they were unable to give me change as there were no coins in the drawer there were dirty fingerprints all over every sign the fudge bottles were empty and covered with syrup dripping down the sides water bottles were for sale but cooler was emptythis was the first time i ever ordered from this abington chipotle restaurant are usually use the chipotle in willow grove pennsylvania on moreland rd but because it was was the one nearest to me  i had to use the one that was closest to me my rice was under cooked  it was brown rice which i wanted  i also had some kernels of uncooked rice the fajita veggies  were way over cooked mushy and had no taste l took  them out because they were so over cooked i really doubt if ill ever order from this particular chipotle restaurant again also the items on the doordash menu is small and you cant add any extras like extra meat or cheese or anythingwas totally underwhelmed here we were seated easily on a weekend night but service was very slow most of the good reviews seem to mention brunch or desserts so maybe dinner just isnt their thing but neither my husband or i were impressed with our entrees and the menu was very limited for a nonadventurous eater like myself this is always a problem though my husband liked the sound of everything on the menu we also had our daughter and it just wasnt particularly kidfriendly which is fine everywhere doesnt need to be  just mentioning it for other parents our hosts on this visit go there pretty often so they must generally have a better impression of it than we gotnot a clean location the prepackaged food could be a safer purchase in comparison to the self serve hot  cold foods i waited for a staff person to complete their cleaning of the ladies restroom  retraining is necessary you dont want the details  this location seems understaffeduncle eds serves up tasty homemade ukranian comfort food make sure you come with an appetite the homemade pies are divine especially the banana cream  my only complaint is the servers i have been there quite a few times and never once seen any of those girls crack a smile they dont even say hello when you sit down they take your order as fast as possible they dont want to answer any questions or offer suggestions when your food is ready they drop it off and immediately turn and walk away not once checking to see if everything is alright good foodas for the staffif you do not like your job find a new onetwo cashiers open on a friday night one express and one regular unacceptable acme  acme is always higher priced than the shop rite less than a mile away but they do have some great sales utilizing sales i was able to get 5 bags of groceries for less than 40 this time   my prescription plan changed so i have to go to the pharmacy inside acme savon so ill browse the sales while im waitinggot food poisoning right after i left the restaurant  made a reservation a few hours before and they didnt have us down so we couldnt sit at a table for date night and instead sat at the community tables overall disappointing because it was overpriced for what you got i want to preface this by saying that i only had beer the minimalist decoration was cool but it felt a little empty  the bartenders were aloof hipsters who didnt seem overly interested in bartending   the beerit just wasnt for me i cant stand ipas and that was really all they had on tapnot the best vietnamese food i have tried the pho was on the smaller side a bit greasy and did not taste like it was simmered long enough the waitress was alright i would not recommend getting the bubble tea it tasted like it was made from powdersooo i wish i would have checked reviews before placing my order everyone seems to love the bagels from what ive read i made the mistake of getting a egg and cheese croissant well croissant was perfectly delicious but the sandwich yuck they put slices of ice cold american cheese with no melting did melt for me after i returned the sandwich and asked tiny place with minimal seating cashier was friendly and personable   i may give this place one more try and go with out of the bagels but for now my review standsthe location is really great with nice mountain views from the bar the beer however disappointed and beer is why i go to a brewery every beer i tasted was just sort of off lacking  in boldness and even containing some bad flavors the pilsner hinted of bubblegum and the peche finished as it appeared like dirty dishwater the saison was the only decent beer of the six i tasted but it wasnt enough to bring me backi want to give 25 stars but my options are 2 or 3 so there it is   this place has great potential so im kind of sad to give it such a low rating the food is good and while the menu isnt extensive it is unique and i actually think we will go back for lunch because we saw some interesting things we wanted to try   the service was weird seemed like 2 waitresses and a hostessmaybe it was kind of confusing our order was messed up and thehostess seemed at a loss until we asked her to just put in the order that was forgotten about for us it was weird that we had to instruct her how to solve the problem she was trying to find the waitress that took the order and seemed confused   the set up for this place needs work its very small which isnt always a problem but in this setting it seems like too much stuff is piled in places without any order the condiment station drinks utensil station extra food stuffs are strewn throughout the space in a haphazard manner shelves loaded with jugs of mayo flour etc lined the back wall there was a cooler behind us on the floor for drinks the water and coffee station was on the other side of us and the condiment station and toaster were to the side of the cooler some curtains to cover this clutter would go pretty far i think   the menus were colored sheets of paper stuck on a clipboard on each table there are also multiple chalkboards with specials written on them throughout the small area they have some unique items that arent really explained well see my pics that would benefit greatly from a menu that has a picture   the food was good my only complaint would be that the eggs in my eggs benedict were overcooked and not runny at all the dutch baby pancake was different im not sure i appreciate the candied lemon that is served on top of it but that might be personal preference   this is petty but it bothers me they are all littered with spelling and grammatical errors i know not everyone cares about that but its just stuff i see and cant unsee   anyway i wish them the best and hope they can improve the flowlayout of their placeim pretty sad to be writing this review i expected better for a place that boasts having been on diners driveins and dives it has been a few years since it has been on the show and i feel like the quality has clearly gone downhill  the look of the place was very divey much like most of the places from the show i have been to eat at we went while we were en route to the airport for our next flight thinking we would have some stellar food we were looking over the menu already getting discouraged when we couldnt find the menu items that we had wanted to try based on the clip from the show ok rotating menu items but no we should have taken that as a sign   the next thing that happened was a girl approached us from the counter to let us know they were having their grills replaced that day and no hot food was available this cut the menu down to about 10 items we ended up getting andys orbit salad and hummus envy to split i decided that i was annoyed that they acted like it was an inconvenience to make a hot drink for my friend who wanted one of their signature coffees   im not really sure why we were asked if we were dining in or ordering takeout if the food was to be served in a plastic takeout box either way the hummus might have been good by itself but the amount of toppings in it really just eliminated the experience there is a such thing as too much going on in one bite and the bites were hard because their homemade pita chips were like rocks i was seriously worried i was going to break my teeth on them we asked for strictly kalearugula mix without the lettuce and they didnt serve that properly overall it was pretty bland and the dressing didnt do it much help   the saving grace here was their fresh fruit tea was pretty good but not enough to earn them a better review rule of thumb if youre remodeling the kitchen and it will kill 90 of your menu just close for the dayit is a great location and the decor inside is amazing first visit didnt prove that great that authentic flavor of mexican food is missing  qdoba  chipotle and far better than this  i dont rate the food low but need to bring up to mark  other than that our server was great  so was the timeonly had take out here once it was good when they had 75 per piece sushi takeout now the price has gone up to 135 per piece how do you say no thank you in japanesenot up to chipotle standards as a whole i love chipotle but this location is subpar they are always out of something yesterday it was medium salsa chips and hard tacos two weeks ago no brown rice veggies or ice the time before that no lemon or veggie before that no steak or chicken   in the last 6 months i havent been here when they havent been out of at least two things for such a limited menu it is very impactful when they are out of items and worst of all there are no signs ahead of time so you wait through the line to the door to find out you can only get half of what you want ive reached out to corporate as this is the only location i have these issues with but nothings changed go to the west chester location or taco maya wont go backi am so done with this branch of jakes  the staff is highly unmotivated slow as molasses and none too bright  ive gotten bad milkshakes but good food when the a team was working  today the owner was working and when the cashier couldnt figure out how to ring up a grilled cheese usually part of a combo i didnt want and large milkshake he just told her to charge me for both  so she did  i had ordered a large fry anyway so there was no need to actually give me the other small fry or drink i paid for right  it didnt matter though because the fries were terrible either freezer burned overcooked or both i paid 27 for lunch for me and my kid which included 2 large shakes and figure they stuck me for 4 that they didnt have to  the jokes on them though bc ill never go back and recommend others stay away as well  go to the one in exton instead as they are friendlier and know what they are doingsuper disappointed with their donuts they are like bread not donuts so imagine a slightly flavored bread with some stuffed with crap in them  now this was our cheat day so we went all out we stood in line for 30 minutes or so i got the blackberry lemon and the beignet the beignet filling tasted like coffee which is not what i was expecting so it ruined it for me the lemon one tasted like slightly stale bread i took 4 bites and threw out almost two whole donuts my friend who is a donut lover and found this place took two bites  and threw hers out too that is crazy for us very very disappointed dont waste your timei dont know it it was my mood what i ordered or just our waiter but i left here wanting  my son being in rare form had me in a sour mood to begin with but that was not the only thing that went wrong with this meal  first off i ordered a diet coke to go with my order but all i ever got was water  we had ordered a turkey sandwich for my son and he ended up getting a grilled cheese  the waiters visit to our table were few and far between so even if i had wanted to comment on the inaccurate order brought out it would have been a bit difficult    i had ordered a muffuletta which i have had before and rather enjoyed but this incarnation was not my bag of tea  the bread was very thick and seemed to crumble when you took a bite of the sandwich  the olive salad was pretty tasteless and i think i even checked to see if it was on the sandwich  all in all i ate about half the sandwich before i just gave up   stephanie had good things to say about this place so im not sure if i just had a bad server and ordered the wrong thing or what but i dont know if i would go back  i would certainly not go out of my way to go backthe food is decent here but overpriced dont know how old this place is but jaipur is catered more to american taste this is not a bad thing but the pricing doesnt justify the food or the environment   there is much better indian food in the areainexplicably busy on any night that counts which probably reflects the dearth of restaurants in the area not the quality of the place yet while on a 25 minute wait i counted 6 open tables of various sizes  and it stayed like that the food is passable  almost generic mexican i would say loud music difficult to have a conversation walk on by if you have other optionsi was born and raised in alton and during high school tonys was the go to place for the greatest pizza ever   i dont live in alton now and just visit a couple times a year  last weekend 6 of us went to tonys for dinner in the bar  my local friends tried to suggest other places but i was determined to go  since it was sunday the restaurant had a great pasta specialsalad pasta and glass of wine for 10  the ladies in our group got the special  the guysone ordered a pizza another wanted the portobello mushroom sandwich and the other guy got a sandwich as well  one of the guys also ordered a beerfrom the list located on the wall  the waitress comes back and first tells one guy they are out of mushrooms so he ordered another sandwich the next guy was told they were out of the beer he ordered and finally the guy who ordered pizza was told they were out of hamburger so they could not make him the pizza with that topping    now how can a restaurant run out of hamburger  and why was the beer they were out of removed from the chalk board sign   anyway we plan another trip back next month and i will not be returningi just do not understand the concept of waiting even more than 15 minutes to eat breakfastbrunch let alone standing in line for an hour3 hours in 30 minutes alone i could go to kroger buy a box of aunt jemima and milk and make my own pancakes  perfect example of hype and marketing being a useful business tool but honestly unless youre a tourist or go to vandy i do not get itid give their beer 3 stars  their flagship rye ipa is great even though its named after a phish song berliner weisse was ok some session beer called 2nd hand wasnt very good  their service 1 star  bartender was rude and arrogant  he had a star tattoo on his elbow to let everyone know hes a toolbox  disappeared for 10 minutes when we wanted to cash outi had tried severaltimes to get inside lotaburger sure glad i didnt wait any longer this was the worst burger i have ever had the burger was so dry i couldnt even squid any juice out of the burger it was all burned around the outside of the burger i had ask what they put in them the lady taking my order told me i chose not to have pickles lettuce well that was right but she didnt tell me that they put mustard i hate mustard so this whole experance was in the toilet for me i wont go back and sure wont tell my friends to go there either  you go a long way to go to a better burgerwe tried the burgers curds onion rings fries an even the ice cream all tasted average and fried items were greasy not worth the hype  disappointedi was excited to try livery ever since i first drove by it and saw the beautiful earthy colors and romantic feel of the landscaping and textures used to create the ambiance also being a part of the cunningham group i had high expectations i plan to go back one more time just to make sure my review is 100 accurate but unfortunately my dreams were crushed the moment i approached the walkway leading up to the main entrance two employees were standing there smoking blocking the sidewalk up to the building i said excuse me and they moved i walked into the restaurant and the hostess said hello and then just stared at me after an uncomfortable couple seconds she said would you like a table i said of course she led us to a table in the bar and it was very nice the server was awkward and didnt bother to explain anything about the menu even though most of it is not in english we ordered drinks a margarita and a cocktail they were delicious we order queso empanadas and brussels sprouts to snack on the empanadas were over cooked too crispy and lacked flavor the brussel sprouts were burnt we paid our bill and leftdont go in expecting it to be pennies food and recipes just under a new name i had the chicken tenders with the house hot sauce the batter on the chicken was different but okay and the hot sauce tasted pretty generic i had slaw and french fries as my sides the slaw had no flavor and was dry the green beans were bland we had a party of 5 and everyone was disappointed even though we tried to think of it as a new placei took my son and my friend there for dessert about a week ago and was highly disappointed by both the sundaes and the service  the brownie in the brownie sundae was so hard it was inedible  my 6 year old ordered the candyland sundae and it arrived without half of the components listed on the menu  all in all the experience was less than i was expectingso we live turning point warrington is great tho the wait is long the new one in north wales is pure and simple filthy floors full of food and crayons tables leave you walking out sticky like honey chairs all so dirty im afraid my pants will have stains on it when i stand up    staff is great manager great get the cleanliness right and ill be back for morei stopped in during the december holiday rush and was very disappointed with the jewelry case of tired motifs totally lacking inspiration and originality i hope it was just picked over and that wasnt the best they had to offer portions of the store are best described as poorly displayed tired sameold grandma gifts galore need a knit scarf or note cards you could make yourself from a low end kit from michaels how about hat from cheap yarn the alpaca items were worth the trip but not much elsei dont prefer this location at all its near my dwelling and this morning i thought of giving them another second chance  i guess i was spoiled at my former starbucks location on the nw side of town off 56th  lafayette rd  i always received friendly greetings and smiles there  this morning 05 of the baristas greeted me when i walked in and waitedwaited to order  i did hear a barista say you have a customer but not a hello  good morning  well be right with you insert smile after any of the three options would have been great friendly customer service just doesnt seem to be their cup of tea or coffee  how hard can good morning be  maybe next timegood daythe wife and i went to bullys on memorial day around 500 and there was hardly anyone there the wife ordered the pork steak sandwich and i had the pork steak dinner i knew when they set the food on the table and saw my pork steak something was wrong the pork steak was thin small and it looked like they took a spoon and smeared the sauce on i always have just used a fork to cut it but it was tough the taste wasnt bad but i was truly surprised they brought it out ive been going to bullys since it opened and always had a great pork steak and sides i hope that this was just a bad day and the food gets better the wifes pork steak was tough also the waiter comped our meal and apologized i definitely will return to see if bullys porksteaks are any better in the near futurewow in reading some of these reviews about crabby bills were wondering if we ate at the same place  we went to the one in clearwater beach and this was not a good experience  the crabcakes were less than memorable while the staff  was quite unfriendly  we may give it another shot sometime this summersorry to be a downer but this place did not meet my expectations from the getgo i wasnt thrilled about their hours as im usually in st louis during the afternoon and evenings on certain days they should call themselves strange donuts with strange hours when i finally did make it over to sd i was excited but then this weirdo hipster dude behind the counter gives me a dead stare and goes hows it going man ummm okay so i browsed briefly and made a selection of four of what i believed to be the most popular donuts there the gooey butter campfire blueberry cheesecake and the one with bacon shreds on top   after the quick transaction i started munching on them on the way to my car and i just couldnt believe it i tasted the gooey butter one first and it was one of those yeast fluffy donuts with very little topping on it i thought this was going to be gooey and moist in cakedonut form it didnt taste like gooey butter cake at all not cool gang same goes for the one with bacon i like bacon on a lot of things but it could have tasted better on a cake donut the campfire one was a cakedonut so it kind of made up for it i gave the blueberry cheesecake one to a friend but he had no reaction there is one thing i learned after coming here the big difference between fluffy yeast donuts and the moist cake donuts if i want fluffy yeast donuts ill just go to schnucks cake donuts are where its at  so again i dont mean to come off as someone who is hard to please but this was a wellhyped place and i bought into it and im from glen carbon on the other side of the river i respect small businesses and i know its a donut shop but try to stay open at reasonable times i also respect those who are very creative with their food and creations so thats why i thought id give you an extra startheir bagging skills need a refresher every time i go shopping there the baggers doesnt matter who it is seems to get frazzled when it comes to putting items into a bag i end up with more bags to carry than neededso the easiest way to do this is break it into two reviews one for brunch and one for dinner  brunch 35 stars  ive been to brunch here maybe a dozen times  the food itself is great  my husband loves the latin poor mans omelette and i adore the pilgrim sandwich  the bread is delicious and all the brunch food ive had has been great  the service however is lacking  things are usually very slow and occasionally come out wrong  the servers always act as if they are panicked and slammed even if there are few people there  dinner 1 star  they only serve dinner on fridays  after being there for brunch so many times i was really excited to try their dinner menu  we went on january 16th 2015  unfortunately it was perhaps the worst dining experience of my life  i wont bore you with too many details just the lowlights  service was unbelievably slow  the meal took 25 hours this was just with appetizers and entrees  15 minutes after my husband ordered his meal the waiter told him they were out so he ordered something else  his meal therefore showed up 10 minutes after everyone elses  one of the appetizers had grapes and many of the grapes had visible mold on them  this was really unacceptable  the mussels i ordered were so cold i had to send them back i really hope it was just a bad night for the restaurant  it was clear that every table was experiencing similar issues  ive never seen so many tables of angry people  the waiter did take the moldy appetizer off the bill and offered us free dessert but after such a terrible meal and being there for far longer than we planned we passed  i havent been back since that disastrous dinner not even for brunch  maybe i will someday but for now id rather give my business to a restaurant that works hard to give their customers a pleasant experiencean average maybe below average mcdonalds but the manager that works dinner time is very nice and helpful with kid related issues clean ups extra happy meal toys etc  i say below average because the food is sometimes cold or the buns are stale or the soda mix is off on the selfserve fountain  its also not the cleanest mcdonalds ive seeni only go here when i cant find what i am looking for somewhere else  the store is actually fine and i never have any problems here  it just seems that the congestion in the parking lot is very high and the chances of getting caught in a game of bumper cars seems much higher than at other places i shop  thats the big issue for me so when i go i park in the boonies and hike innothing particularly wrong with the farm  though there are others in the area just as or even more engaging  but the pricing is out of control and definitely not worth what you pay for everything is an additional price for everyone ie parents have to pay to supervise their kids on a playground and even with one kid it adds up super disappointing it wasnt always like this cant imagine going back again just not worth itconcierge recommended this place  so off we went  service was a bit slow which i can handle if the food is good  it was not  since they were stil serving lunch we ordered the po boy special shrimp sauteed in spicy citrus butter w spicy slaw and a po boy with grilled shrimp  the bread on the special was hard and the sauteed shrimp was super bland as in they did not bother to season it  to add insult to injury the shrimp were extremely small and not cleaned  i will admit that grilled shrimp po boy was not on the menu only fried so i was taking a chance with the modification  but there is no excuse for not seasing the shrimp at all  the seafood gumbo was not bad  i would give it a b    all in all a highly disappointing meali have been to bareburgers all throughout new york and have always loved them tonight my experience in philadelphia was less than happy i ordered a burger to go with fries on a gluten free bun and a side of brussels sprout slaw  1 the gluten free bun is not what they used to offer the mouth feel is gross it gets soggy and is much bigger than the burger  2 the fries were exceptionally cold and soggy i know fried foods doesnt stay great for long but i ate my meal almost immediately after ordering and they tasted raw  3 the slaw i dont even know how it can be called that it was completely dry had no flavor it literally tasted like brussels sprouts were shredded with red onion or shallots and thats it i took two bites and throw it away  for 2052 to eat a burger with fries and coleslaw i expect to thoroughly enjoy my meal i did not at all and actually am still hungry very disappointingive been here several times and as a local there are a ton of other greek restaurants that are so much better greek salad is tasteless everything just isnt up to par the gyro meat was dry only thing that was decent was the tzatziki and the pita breadthis is a small place but can do really goodfood was okaybut everything else not good we had difficult finding a table no one even said a word when asked where can we sit suggestion was you can sit outside well its rainy season peoplefinally we found a table which was not clean and no one even bothered to clean it thats not it there were small bugs flying finally we placed order and it took forever to get it on table word of advise if you have kids please dont consider this place good luckit depends on your definition of a donut one very expensive donut with unusual flavors or a bunch of classic donuts mehwhy only two well the coffee was fine yes there was some pretty latte art but besides that it was nothing especially remarkable the ambiance is neat  sort of a rustic meets industrial vibe the place was packed my friends and i managed to find some space at the long table and those stools are definitely the antithesis of comfortable the choice was style over comfort and the parking situation really crappy oof  now the real reason im not loving bb that much  the service the lumberjackesque man who served our coffees was fine but the hipster dbag we ordered from was a total turnoff he wasnt friendly to begin with and then when there was some joking over spelling my friends name he got sort of offended questions were also clearly not welcome guess you have to be a regular and know exactly what you want to be on this guys good side all i could do the entire time was think of chris hardwicks bit during the transaction hipsters please dont work in the service industry you dont want to serve us we dont want to be served by you   i was cursing the recommendation to hit this spot as a meeting point im not sure i would ever go back without someone asking to meet me therehonestly i wasnt impressed at all the looks of the donuts is for sure a good selling point but the taste is where it all went downhill   my wife and i went by the shop a couple of hours after they opened but well before they closed for the day we got 6 different donuts so we could try a variety the only two we found to be decent were a raspberry filled one and a basic vanilla one with sprinkles which you can find at any donut shop the rest were very dry and bland oreo topped one french toast one graham cracker topped one and a gooey butter cake one   then comes the price i understand that these donuts are different from others but 9 and some change for 6 donuts was pretty high   we may not eat donuts all that often but next time we will be going elsewheremediocre food terrible service from the bartender on up to the server bartender was annoyed that she had to do her job didnt want to tip her but did because we were told it was a 35 minute wait and i was afraid wed be back at the bar for drinks before being seated husband had the crab cakes premade probably previously frozen my mahi mahi was so dry and overcooked it could have been mistaken for chicken mahi and crab cakes both way over seasoned only positive is that we were able to get our 9 year old foodie a kids lobster tail for 1199 instead of buying an adult portion for 3x the price do not recommend will not go backthe chef was angry and you could hear it  the staff did their best to put smile on face so credit to them  the food was not properly cooked for example my wife ordered poached eggs 1 was perfect and the other was hard    i ordered scrambled eggs and they were runny  that is difficult to mess up     the hash browns were awesome and the staff did their best  but plenty of better options availi really dislike this place theres nothing nothing nothing to do other than see machines eat your money well and drink but im not an alcoholic nor a gambler so after one over priced drink and a walk around the money eating machines im done  if you go to the one in hollywood fl then you will know what im talking about  this place is just a casino i mean if you are looking for just playing and wasting ur money you must go  if you want to have fun and have a drink and look for things to do dont go  its better to stay home really theres nothing to do   well other than eat the restaurants are pricey but good thats the reason im giving 2 stars  but im never gonna go there unless i get invited  ps almost forgot theres only like this lil corner that plays music and the quality of people there ewww its like you got sucked into a black hole and ended in a parallel tacky universe i was even almost molested walking through therewent here on sunday to attend an album release party so i was not dining in and from the other reviews i should count my blessings in the back of the restaurant through the doors is a really nice intimate venue its ashame the bartenders suck the bar was extremely crowded so i understood the long wait however generally if theres and event  most places will staff more than one bartender its a novel idea but it just might work   so after my friend and i got tired of waiting we went to themain bar and the chick bartending had the nastiest attitude and horrible customer service she proceeded to walk past us twice and serve other customers eventhough we told her wed like to order and the other patrons came up after us so we went back to the slow bartender and after he took 25 mins to get our order and spent another 20mins reading the ingriedients on the menu to make our carribean punches we got our drinks in less than an hour based on that experience i would never patronize the restaurant plus the parking situation is atrocious sux too cause the drink actually turned out goodsadly since my initial glowing review dooners as gone way down hill   disregard my previous rating and remarks its no longer the hidden fresh treasure it once was apparently a change of owners has occurred  hopefully they can get back to the quality and fresh standards that used to set them apart and earned the high ratingsi love dd coffee  donuts but this location has the worst service its frustrating when the counter person talks to other customers and employees about nothing instead of taking orders their sloppy looking and most of them have the personality of a wet rag to the ownerget involved or get outsuper disappointing after standing in the rain to get in the food was not good my husband ordered the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns there was one slice of bacon and the hash browns were bland and watery i got the shrimp and grits the shrimp had a really good flavor but the grits were really bland i have to believe that the kitchen was having an off day because of all the positive reviews however based on our experience we wont be backi been here twice and both times i left feeling disappointed dont get me wrong the place has major potential the old building is charming and they have a vegetarian menu but based on my dining experiences i dont think anyone in the kitchen understands what a vegetarian is the first time i came here i ordered the veggie reuben it was super tasty but midway through my lunch i discovered that someone in the kitchen had accidentally put corned beef on my sandwich and decided it would be ok to pick it off not ok the second time i came here i ordered another one of their sandwiches i cant recall which one but it was pretty much just lettuce on dry bread totally disgusting i really wanted to like the whistle stop but after my experiences i wont be headed backits part diner part kosher style deli no part of it would stop me from going up the street to kibitz room for food that is infinitely betteronce upon a time companion was my number one lunch spot in st louis but since they closed their cwe location im forced to drive to their ladue location and let me tell youits just not the same the menu has changed for the worse imo the service is consistently poor the prices are in no way fair also on multiple visits i have spotted a mouse trap in the main dining room empty but still unappetizingthe iced tea cornbread and variety of soups are the only things that keep me coming backwell and the memory of companions glory days in the cwe so masochists if youre looking to choke down pretentious 13 salads and like eating at wobbly tables companion is your best beti went to the bakery house after reading other yelp reviews hoping that the positive 5star notes rang true i am sad to say that i agree with the people who said the baked goods are overpriced and surprisingly mediocre maybe i just didnt order the right thing it seems like everyone loves the birthday sheet cakes i purchased a small strawberry rhubarb pie at 22 yes 22 for that kind of money i expect the pie to be amazing in a word not it was okay it certainly wasnt bad but the filling was very soupy and too sugary sweet i love the bite of rhubarb and i didnt taste it at all theres a chance ill give the bakery house another shot    but why recommend this place when there are other more reasonable bakeries and supermarkets where i can buy mediocre baked goods for half the pricestopped in with a coworker for lunch my coworker received his meal as he was finishing his meal my burger was finally ready unfortunately the burger was screwed up to the point of being inedible definitely not happy to have wasted my lunch hour fortunately there are many quality eateries nearby i need not be tempted to attempt to eat here again i cannot recommend this establishment unless you enjoy having your time wasted unnecessarilyfood was ok the greek fries were good had octopus not as good as dimitris guy at the hosthostess deskneeds some customer service clasesjust wish they could realize people go through a drive through for quick service  please management hire more help  waiting 10 minutes in a drive through is crazy  luckily the people who eventually served us were very nicewe chose han dynasty after recommendations from a friend and were very excited we drove the 40 minutes to exton in friday evening traffic and were pleased by the overall appearance we joked about their website as han dynasty types as handynasty and in the end it did turn out to be handy nasty service was slow unfriendly and incorrect when asked questions  we ordered the won ton soup fried dumplings and dan dan noodles as apps they were ok the soup was cold and the dan dan noodles i thought had a weird taste the dumplings were thick and the dumpling sauce tasteless  we ordered a variety of mains however my dinner didnt come out until the rest of my party was finished eating i had to sit there and watch everyone not really enjoy their meals apparently the shredded duck was super salty the crispy noodles which when asked what they entailed were told noodles with a sauce came out looking like a bed of noodles under slimy breaded pieces of something we thought it may have been beef chicken and fish my friend was disappointed because he didnt eat beef or fish my other 2 friends liked their dishes garlic shrimp  kung pao chicken my kung pao shrimp came out and tasted nice but the little bit of rice was cold and no server ever came back to the table to see if we needed anything we complained to the manager and she took 10 off our bill but it didnt really make up for the fact that our nice dinner out was ruined  thankfully we had desert back at the housewent in for shortbread cookies and birthday cupcakes and they were pretty disappointing shortbread was bland and they had a fondant cutout instead of regular icing that wasnt sweet enough i ended up throwing most of the cookie out the cupcake was also disappointing a little hint of vanilla but nothing great   the prices were way off the cookie i got was over 4 because it was a special themed cutout but the cupcakes and other large cookies were half that   id go back for a second chance because their lemon bars looked really good but wouldnt go back for much elsesecond time to this location and theyre out of bubblegum ice cream thats the last time i drive across town for you baskin robbins playing with my sweet tooth is like playing with my emotionsone thing starbucks does well is brand recognition this was my first time to this location and it looks like all the others so i felt like i had been there a million times before this can be seen as a positive and a negative  it is great because you are familiar with the layout and the menus etc but not so great because there is no individuality uniqueness or more personal feel to the place  the drinks and treats are exactly what is expected from a starbucks location any starbucks location what separates the good from the bad is location and service unfortunately this particular starbucks fails on both accounts  i went at 430pm on a saturday afternoon and the place was not busy however finding a parking spot and negotiating the parking lot was a feat all on its own unfortunately there is a tt supermarket directly across the parking lot and all of these customers were consuming the parking and walking haphazardly in the paved lot this made it a unique challenge even to get in the door  once i had made it in i was able to walk right up to the counter and attempt to order the baristas were all busy cleaning and so it took a while to get their attention but eventually i placed my order the friend i was meeting had arrived before me so instead of waiting at the counter for my drink i sat with her and chatted for a while next thing i realize that ten minutes had gone by and my drink was still not prepared so back up to the counter i went again all of the baristas were cleaning machines and organizing items behind the counter  they all had forgotten about my drink luckily i was not in a rush because from the time i walked in until i received my beverage was over 15 minutes   there are two other starbucks at the intersection of 97th street and 137th ave and without being to either i would recommend trying both of them over this locationice cream is good but overpriced  also the shop was not well maintained  ie tables not wiped down and there were several employees on a not too busy eveningmeh  just reopened  staff needs training  had to scream to get service as waitresses were having a pow wow pickles ok but cant compete with kibbutz room  beets were great actually bagel crummy  supermarket variety  carrot cake tasted good but a plate full of crumbs   pricey but not exceptionalpicture it lunch with coworkers  so a coworker suggested this place for lunch and said they have great bbq that alone had me thinking this place would deliver on flavorsadly it did not  now im no bbq snobbut ive had my share of bbq in the st louis area for starters my pulled pork sandwich arrived a bit on the cold side the actual bbq itself was cold not hot like bbq should be and adding cole slaw for 1 was not a game changer as the waitress touted in fact the cole slaw was rather bland and i scraped it away from the bbq after realizing such  the variety of sauces were okay until i actually tried them none of them had good flavor the sides i chose were potato salad and baked beans the potato salad was also bland and oddly the potatoes were diced in small squaresandthey lacked that starchy flavor and texture of you know a potato the baked beans are frankly no pun intended an embarrassment too sweet and totally taste like they are canned and ive had some tasty canned baked beans  the coworker who suggested this place ordered a philly brisket sandwich and ill admit it looked good but alas my lunch was below mediocre and i doubt ill revisit anytime soon  service was alright we did have to remind the waitress a few times for items and when the other coworkers asked for a togo box she returned with the smallest boxes everresulting in another request that she bring bigger boxes i did not pack mine togo nor did i finish itconfusing why do you need 6 different souvenir shops selling the same items in one building its like if you went to a mall that just had a dozen old navys unnecessary  anyway we came here for the food court which was also a bit of a disappointment thankfully this place is more or less free of food chains at least major ones but the options available were still bleak especially for a vegetarian i eventually selected a veggie burrito from the mexican vendor and it was acceptable but nothing worth writing home about  i would have been most excited about the falafel placeif it had been open it was only 5 pm on a tuesday y u close so earlydisclaimer i am only reviewing the takeoutrestaurant side of this business not the seafood market which may very well be perfectly fine i havent purchased uncooked seafood there yet ive only got takeout sandwiches and sushi at this point i would like to give a higher mark here but their service is just so unreliable i ve had several good experiences but more negative ones over the last 2 years their menu is great they source their seafood sustainably have sushi optionssometimes the sushi chef isnt there thus no sushi and when properly made their prepared food is delicious it is just so hit or miss on a bad day your food is extremely late barely edible and servers are borderline rude or at least inattentive on a good night the service quick and attentive the dishes are impeccable and im left wanting more however unfortunately there are more bad days than good which is why i will not be returning for the prices they charge i can find better in this city i expect consistant quality and service with a smile every time not just sometimes so sad i had such high hopes for this place but ive been let down too many timesoverall a cozy place nice staff no complaints there but ketchup exploded out the bottle on me being from idaho i know fries and the truffle fries were limp and kinda gross burger was on par with some restaurants that dont specialize on just that personally the food there needs to burger up to do the restaurant justice two stars is pretty much all i can give thema coworker bought me food to go from here on tuesday of this week for my birthday last week and today i got a dish i used to enjoy at a restaurant owned by the current owners parent in the mid 90s which i thought or was led to believe was the reincarnation of that dish more on that in a minute   i will start my review on tuesday with the to go order for myself and two coworkers i arrived and waited about 7 minutes for the order when i arrived on time for pick up i got the food it was quite messy when i made it to the office i was confused as to why but when i opened my dish i found out why there was at least a cup or two of sauce in my generals chicken i would say it was filled up to halfway in a standard to go square box that immediately turned my off because i am not an super saucey person the portion was decent and it came w steamed rice   i dug in i was hungry it was super bready another turnoff for me overall the flavor okay not mind blowing but good but with the volcano sauce which again made a mess in the bag getting on everything which i needed to wash off and the super breading i would give it 3 stars also i asked for hot mustard and never received found out they only have cheap packets here no real mustard    the reason i went back so fast was i found out the new owners parents used to own golden flower on virginia street by sports west i fell in love with the lemon grass chicken there and would get it at least 1x per week this was when i was young and had little money so if i spent money consistently that was money that delivered to me in all the ways possible i used to love that dish and i have never found a replacement in town that even comes close it in taste or value when the new owner implied she had the recipes before golden flower was sold in 1995 to the current owners who i found out just sold it this year invited back to see if i agreed which i readily accepted   i arrived today to sit and order but it was 1215pm so prime lunch time for friday and it was about 1015 tables and many looked like they just sat so i decided to take it to go thinking it would be faster i didnt look at the menu ordered ala carte paid and then was told 1520 minutes not my favorite thing to hear but i already paid so i waited patiently again expecting a long lost favorite dish resurrected from a cherished time remembered ready to reexperience with the most likely person to recreate the daughter of the owners who was there during that special time   i got to the office and started paying attention to my food i was anxiously anticipating eating and i noticed the weight was light it didnt feel like a meal i was hoping i was wrong i got to the lunch room opened the bag and looked it over and it didnt look like a big portion nor did it have lemon grass it didnt look wow just like huh so i dug in hoping the flavors were there and sadly they were not the chicken was overcooked no lemongrass a few scallion were there some onions didnt taste garlic or ginger and the curry was abundant but little flavor except salt this dish fell flat   it was edible and okay but i would never order again and thats the reason for the two stars when it comes to food i hold in high regard it needs to hit me in a sweet spot and this food did not my biggest complaint besides overcooked and dry chicken is no lemongrass in lemongrass chicken i just do not understand when this was the daughter of whos famous in my book of the best of the best and i remember the delicious and unique flavor of the abundant lemon grass in the dish back in the mid 90s also the portion was 12 size it wasnt a dinner portion it was like a lunch portion plus last but not least the curry was super weak its kind you buy over the counter maybe dont seal after using maybe at the end of shift and after 23 months of this lack of respect its stale and you can taste salt only and just see the yellow of the curry and thats about it   two more thoughts as i put much thought into my reviews and do not take giving out reviews lightly my coworker order the bbq pork and shrimp w noodles they put 2 count 2 shrimp in her dish she didnt volunteer the information but we were having a conversation and i was telling her i get scared to order shrimp most places because of the freshness etc i then asked to see a shrimp in her dish to judge which she just started eating and she said i dont have anymore and i said why she said well there was only 2   last thought my coworker on this visit order spring rolls we had two not very large springs rolls for 6 value sucked and i would never order these again   overall sf kitchen is a nice place in somewhat awkward neighborhood but its just not for me but it might fit for youblakes aight burger  bun was soggy and they forgot the dipping sauce for our chicken strips i wonder is the staff there eats chicken strips with no sauce i really doubt it careless service especially for a new restaurant in towni found the place to be a bit noisy and the tables to close for my taste as for the food i ordered the monte cristo i guess it was just ok the potatoes where just flat out dry i literally just picked at it the menu description of food and sleek website had me expecting something more exciting and intimate than an ihop without boothsthe food and beer is excellent we have been here at least a dozen times with our toddlers and have had no issues with bringing our toddlerfriendly foods in while we enjoy our meal this time we were asked to either put our outside food away or leave because of a health code violation despite the numerous tables around us with kids eating their own food next time if you are going to institute a policy that will undoubtedly steer families like us away the least you could do is be consistent with it we were singled out not a happy patron todayits a whole foods but what will keep me from shopping here is the incredibly offensive butcher behind glass and the hanging carcasses  i truly can not imagine what might have motivated you to do this i am not a vegan but you must have many who shop here is this not going to turn them away i not a vegan but this is so horrible i can not shop here again i cant understand how you came to this decisionmy disclaimer to soften the blow i am not a selfproclaimed foodie nor do i profess to know allthingsgoodbecauseifounditfirst i do not buy local just because it is local yet i will stalk local purveyors because i honestly want them to succeed the expectation for my 21 dozen strange donuts experience was to walk away saying dmn that was good promote it and offer repeat visits at this point i am not able to commit to any of that  i visited on a saturday morning around 11am the small line of customers 10 moved quickly through the queue and the counter personnel were attentive the display case was filled with many varieties the types i bought were strawberry shortcake mexican chocolate oreo bacon and barts not one was what i consider fresh my wife and daughter both thought they might be leftovers from friday latenight i think that was a good assessment of taste and texture because while they were not stale they surely were not fresh  next simply grabbing stuff from the candy cookie and cereal aisle of a local grocer then crushing and dumping on a donut does not make it strange granted there are not a lot of other places competing with the concept but a product needs to be sound at the base plain yeast or cake donuts need to stand on their own even though i did not have either basic type unadorned the toppings could not mask the inferior quality beneath it is true that the crushed oreos did taste like oreos and the butterfinger crumbles did taste like butterfingers but i do not think this should be considered part of the quality of the product otherwise i would be reviewing nabisco or nestl   there are some really good 2 and 3star yelp reviews here which are more than just bashing a small business or trying to thwart their success i hope the strange donuts crew looks for a common theme please regroup retool and i will then be willing to drop another 21 for a dozen donutsthis is without doubt the one of the worst casinos i have been to just to give you a brief background i frequent vegas and have seeked out casinos during my travels in europe canada america this place is gross and the only reason i have gone a third time is because the cashier line from the second time was so long due to only two cashiers working at a prime friday night time the only reason i went a second time was killing time before picking up family at an airport  this is a heavily smoking casino however the cleaning agents that they use will bother you more than the poorly ventilated smokey atmosphere  their rewards program expires after three months of inactivity  their table games have a very high minimum even during non peak hours and other tables empty  their parking is a mess however they are putting in a new garage  slot odds are horrible  there is no cohesion in what slots are where and how to find them except of course the high limit  having been to a few casinos well many i can determine this casino is catered towards the low income this is sad i am pro casino except when they run it this way  my recommendation stay away and send a message and by no means am i upset in losing money as it is such an unenjoyable experience ive never spent enough money to question my losses herehoping they close this joint so that something worthwhile can take its place 10 gyros nothing special odd atmosphere its hot as hell inside and during my last visit there was rap music playing wish i had gone to subway next door and thats saying somethinggreat chowder and lobster roll  however the mussels were very bad tasting  at least you can buy seafood here so that makes up for itjust found out today they wont serve non fat milk what a shame i use to enjoy this placefood good ate in  service more than poor ordered soup came out barely warm asked to have t warmed up waitress took it away  waited 15 min asked her about the soup oh i was busy by then rest of the meal out so cancelled the soup and the guy on the register trashed me out for saying take the soup off my bill the good food not worth the surly service wont go backive never actually left a review on any place because it feels really mean but honestly im so poor and those 10 i spent were really a lot so i want to save everyone else from making the mistake i did the name of the place is pho bistro dont get the damn pad thai literally do not do it the name is pho not thai food there unfortunately are very very limited options in the area so i was desperate but honestly just do not do it i wanted authentic thai not made by a lady named sharon andit was honestly the most disappointing and depressing pad thai ive ever had and i pretty much try to get pad thai wherever i go it was literally bright orange noodles with zero flavor and i feel so mean saying that because i work in foodservice whatever starbucks for over a year and i get it i know sometimes shit happens and the service was honestly great super nice really friendly food came out fastit just sucked  it was bright orange you guys what even is that the chicken wasweird and scary just had a bad taste it didnt taste like pad thai at all and im really bummed bc i cant even afford to be spending money like that and i shouldve just gone with their pho ive had their pho before that shit was hella dank i recommend that 100 the place is great their pad thai justim scarred tbh shouldve known better than to go for thai at a place literally called pho bistro excuse me while i cry over the 10 down the drain i couldnt finish it honestly it just wasnt pad thai the noodles literally looked like angel hair pasta im really upset and sad mostly sad because i feel like if i was a dish i would be that sad sorry excuse of pad thai anywho their pho is great and they give you a good amount too dont get the pad thai though one day their bakery was wonderful  the next day we purchased 15 worth of products only to find they were old  the next morning i returned to the market so i took my receipt and was treated pretty rudely  it would have been easy to make me happy as they had done the first day i went there  but the lady who said she was the manager was a real crumbi stopped by we ate 3 donuts and some form of sausage in a bunthey asked if i wanted it in the microwavethe horror  the place is straight out of the 1980si wont be back     saw some post claiming these are california doughnuts well just like the pizza you can keep themtypical indian buffet but definitely on the high end of the scale for a selfserve place the service is very good they bring out naan silverware and drinks the food is all fresh warm and very good the atmosphere is cozy its dimly lit with traditional indian decorations and soft indian music 1010  edit i had tripped on my way to take a photo and was on the ground for a few seconds as i got to the buffet i felt something crawling on my elbow i slapped it and two bugs about stink bug sizebut with the body structure of a ladybug ran towards the the buffet and disappearedliterally seconds after i posted my original review i was in shock for several minutes but took the photo of the buffet nonetheless 310 because the food was nice and the decor was good but bugs on the floorwe have been to many different cheddars restaurants over the years in many different locations we love them because theyre always super fast cheap and delicious today was our first time eating at the mount juliet location and i have to say we were not impressed   when we checked in with the hostess she told us there was a 510 minute wait 25 minutes later we get a table and the restaurant was full of empty tables  it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come to the table we gave her our entire order at that time drinks food and appetizer   while we were waiting a couple at a table beside us found a bug in their food i heard them tell their waitress and the manager telling them that they spray for bugs all the time   i think they were understaffed but that was the worst experience at cheddars we have had so far i dont think well be back to this locationafter standing at the register waiting for what seemed like an eternity for someone to help me i finally placed my notrealdifficullt order for a medium latte with one pump of syrup  ohi forgot to mention that when i was waiting for what seemed like an eternity there were two people standing statuesquely behind the registers  i kid you not  it was almost like time stopped and we were all frozen for a few minutes  awkward  anyway same girl who took my order goes to make my drink and gets into an argument with another barista about resteaming the milk  surprise surprise my lazy girl wanted to just reheat the stuff that had been sitting around which wouldve been okay with me had she at least made a bit of an attempt to top off with a gulp of fresh milkas it were there was about an extra 1 12 inches of nothing at the top of my cup    so she goes to squirt the syrup and squirts three times and then tries to argue with me that one shot is actually 3 pumps  which is fine but i specifically said one pump  she admitted that thats what i said but then proceeded to say again that three pumps equaled one pumpnow thinking about math problems makes my palms sweat and im not that great at it but i do know that 1 does not equal 3  moron  i forgive  i forget  but this is maybe the 5th time that something like this has happened at this location  i wont be backfilthy dirty restaurant the walls are covered with food and greasy handprints understaffed ok foodtried wendys again this afternoon  its winter its always freezing in there  we asked for the heat to be turned up it wasnt we asked the guy to turn it up again and he said he told the manager and she said no  we said wed talk to her boss and the guy said her boss was there as well and he didnt care either  so i said id talk to corporate  sent them an email when i got home and will follow up tomorrow with a phone call  needless to say we wont be going back there  tables are still being swiped with a dirty rag and are still dirtylosing charm dirty premises inconsistent food depressing service   ill start with the hope for new life to breathe into this formerly charming neighborhood tent pole im really rooting for them   i have had lovely experiences here i have had wonderful pies cakes milk shakes so lovely i am willing to brave the servers who sigh with disappointment at my apologetic face so sorry to bother you but i would like to buy a slice of your pie  until i had one or two slices of of disenchanting desserts and then my bravery decreased tonight might have been the last straw however   time it was 9pm late for philadelphia on a sunday and we had a sweet tooth   cleanliness the restaurant is usually casually shabby but tonights counters were covered with dirty towels sticky dishes and and melted lumps of cream front and back counters   food the pie was a continuation of our downward experience burned in places and raw in others what happened it used to be so good my hot chocolate was cold and more syrup than anything   service the girl at the counter was her usual just barely tolerating a customer posture  i found someone who told me in a friendly tone that she was the owner and i let her know about our experience being much lower than we expected she explained the restaurant was out of the usual chocolate recipe but then asked have you had our pie before im not sure what that had to do with the bad pie but she said she would check up on the matter   she didnt really seem concerned and thats perhaps my concern no one at more than ice cream appears concerned with keeping a clean place with consistently decent food and generally friendly service   i hope this changesmy family and i went to popeyes while stopping at the delaware welcome center travel plaza and this popeyes definitely is one of the worst ones that i have been too even the popeyes in mall food courts are better  this outlet didnt have all the sauces that popeyes normally has it just had boring ranch and buffalo sauce the breading of the chicken strips was bad and continuously fell off the food at a normal popeyes is definitely better  pretty much all the restaurant options at the delaware welcome center travel plaza are bad so i wouldnt have high hopes for anythingthe food is good but the service is terrible  often they are out of main menu items  there is bettertwo stars because the service is nice friendly and fast but the food what a disappointment good fried chicken although nothing to write home about but fairly disappointing sides i had the collard greens and they were actually gritty like sand between my teeth and the fried green tomatoes one of my alltime southern favorites were also a waste of 6 small slices mostly end pieces batter slipping off the only side i enjoyed quite a bit was the mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows  delicious  overall though it was a pretty negative experience we wont be returning for a while unless we hear that the kitchen has stepped it upafter waiting for 30 minutes for my food none of which had to be cooked they proceeded to tell me that they ran out they tried to give me a refund but nobody knew how to use the cash register which prompted everybody to start yelling at each other including at me i had no idea what to order for that as practically everything else had run out i ended up with a measly container of greens hk nola really needs to work on their customer service just because the main clientele is college students doesnt mean they deserve to be treated as less thanmy coworker and i were craving a strawberry smoothie and this place was literally 002 miles away we decided why not because sometimes orange julius smoothies can hit the spot  no no no  we were better off making a smoothie with our hands the smoothie wasnt smooth at all seriously how the hell are you known for shakes and smoothies and im literally chewing on the smoothie big chucks of ice just ruining each attempt of a sip in your strawi came in here for a french macaroon and it just wasnt good at all the macaroon was very hard on the outside and the inside was just like a empty pocket i was very disappointed but the reason why i didnt give this place a one star is because the service was very good the girl at the front counter was very niceokay but not great  burgers were undersized and okay fun experience but not a food hotspotgood selection of products but way too crowded and expensive for my taste  this is like the touristy place you always have to go to when you come into town but never really purchase anything substantial  a cannoli maybe  many people really love the placeokay nice atmosphere food is tasty enough staff is just pleasant enough two out of three people in our party had to send back steaks for being over and under cooked filet requested medium well came out medium both timesand finally was just sent away the waitress said to just order well done next time really  yes she really did say that  the second steak was a ribeye and  was requested medium it came out close to well done the first time the second time a new ribeye cane out much juicier but still on the very medium well side the filet did get taken off the bill so that was good but the rest was not discounted  even after the manager saw it was still overcooked    overall its okay but nothing to write home about there are much better choices nearbyi appreciate that theyre a familyowned local business i really do but the fact that theres a rouses nearby and a whole foods quite literally across the street means i dont have to travel much further for a wider selection or more competitive prices    its directly on the metairie route for mardi grasirishitalian parades so if youre attending one of those and run out of drinkfoodstuffs breaux mart will be right there for youpretty much as expected washington avenue dive corner bar atmosphere saturday nightsmokey crowded and loud not really favorite type of venue but i was with a birthday party group most of whom were about half my age i knew the job was dangerous when i took it  service at the bar was very good which was pretty amazing considering the crowd around the bar was 23 deep  buckets of long necks for 10 is a fair deal and watching games of giant jenga unfold as the participants get drunker can be amusing am i likely to become a regular no not a big fan of the having to take a shower at 130 am because of thick second hand smoke  as long as you know what youre getting into its an ok place id maybe go as high as 25 starsnaw make that 225i had high hopes for this place based on previous reviews but i was left disappointed i ordered a passionfruit green tea with pearls and i have definitely had better it was quite watery so the flavour just wasnt there maybe they were having an off daywent to get fancy donuts and they did not have any fancy donuts available only the fresh ones the restaurant is called federal donuts donuts should always be available  ps im only giving this two stars because they did not have any donuts the hot fresh donuts with cinnamon or strawberry lavender are good but you cant just tell customers that you dont have any of the other products availableso i have seen this place talked about in nashville scene on the food network and cooking channel so i figured it would be a great place to check out with a friend i guess i should also include the disclaimer that i dont like pancakes or anything that you would put maple syrup on gasp i know i am crazy  i didnt mind the 3045 min wait outside as it was a beautiful day out but in the middle of summer or winter i highly doubt i would wait in the line they do have water and coffee on a cart outside for the people waiting in line  so the restaurant really has no ambiance it is just a large plain room with lots of tables nothing special to write home about i got the pantry breakfast wrap and it was pretty good and very reasonable however i dont know if it was good enough for the 3045 min wait my friend got the swiss chocolate chip pancakes and said they were great  personally i just dont get the hype but a girl who doesnt like pancakes probably wouldnt be a huge fan of the pancake pantryive been here 2x once with a group and once for an anniversary dinner the food was pretty good we mainly just wanted somewhere that was byo the reason why i only give them 2 stars is because of the atrocious wait staff the first time i was there we had such a hard time flagging down our waiter for anything but assumed it was because they were somewhat busy only about 60 full the food also took forever the second time i went back with my boyfriend the food also took over 35 mins and it was a monday night after we were finished eating i repeatedly asked for the dessert menu from 3 different waiters and yet none of them brought it finally after 25 mins of waiting for it  our waiter just brought us the check incredibly rude and inefficient the food is good and the place looks cute but not worth iti went to that barbq place when it first opened and thought it was decent so decided to go there for lunch with a friend today to try it again we met at 1130 so it was very quiet when i first got there but it did pick up later  i ordered and by the time i had paid my food was ready on the counter very fast maybe too fast i ordered the brisket sandwich with beans and my friend got the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes   the first bite was pretty disappointing then bun was stale and tasted a few days old the brisket was very dry and pretty flavourless i was able to douse the meat in barbecue sauce so that kind of salvaged it but i prefer to have the meat stand alone not just be masqueraded in a sauce there was no saving the stale bun though  i had tried the pit beans the first time i was there and enjoyed the smoky taste and brisket mixed in this time i could hardly distinguish them from beans straight out of a can   my friend wasnt very fond of his pulled pork sandwich saying that it was very bland  honestly the only saving grace of this place is the barbecue sauce everything else was a big meh ive had much better barbecue at chain restaurants than this specialty barbecue placeoh bake 425 so much unrealized potential i have been here twice both with groupons otherwise i wouldnt bother it is a great concept local organic foods that should do well on the main line however every time i walk by 425 it is empty some suggestions  1 take out the vintage oven and winslow cutout on the left when you enter and put in a couple of tables the salads especially the cobb here are fantastic and dont require cooking so why not have a couple of tables eating in the car is a drag   2 im not really sure why you would advocate a bakeathome pizza place in a college town with a million other pizza places many of the college kids dont have ovens and they have money or their parents via wildcat cards  as my husband says i dont know why youd want to spend 20 on a pizza that you have to cook at home i guess the ingredients but i dont really want to spend that price to have to do the leg work myself lazy maybe but ive heard many others say the same thing   3 i would bake a few pies and sell by the slice at the store this would entice people to come during lunch and encourage them to buy the pies to eat at home same thing with the cookies  with a few changes i think this place could really thrive on the main line however i am puzzled by their current business approach since 425 is owned by the same people as peace a pizza meh i am surprised that they dont have a similar dinein or carryout option as the store further west on lancaster if they dont change i dont expect to see 425 survive the next year which is a shamei went in for crawfish potatoes and corn  i asked the cashier were they hot because they were sitting behind her as she was putting them in the bag she said there warm we cooked them today everything was cold the corn was dried out and potatoes were cold nothing was seasoned i understand its not crawfish season but that was awful if they werent go an steam them per request they shouldnt sell cold and oldpour house is like a frat house complete with that silly bean bag game shuffle board and giant jenga its saving gracecheap beer the beer has to be cheap because the service is awful it looked only one person was working in the entire bar the night i was there and i arrived at 10pm what   the crowd is a frat boy crowd ie a little douchy but not too out of control simply not a crowd i have a lot of experience with ie i dont hang out with college students or people who forgot they are not in college anymore  i wouldnt choose to go back but if someone else was dead set on having a get together there i would walk back in the place under duresswe walked into the restaurant we were greeted by a very somber not so happy looking host the restaurant smelled like burnt food and was not appetizing we contemplated leaving but after a long day and kids were hungry we decided to stay  my son got a bottomless root beer float and the root beer was very very watereddown would not order again if this is the norm maybe they were almost out of it his mack and cheese was decent and the carrots tasted like they had been in water for a long time and had a slight mildewy taste my daughter loved her chicken on a stick with side of sliced apples we got the onion stack as an appetizer and the dipping sauces were pretty good and onion rings or decent our burgers were good or server was slow but very sweet and helpful  the restaurant is small and not as clean as the location in citrus park mall i do not think we would ever return unless this was a convenient place to gowhile in nashville we had read and heard many times that pancake pantry was a must for breakfast we were prepared for a line and there definitely was one close to 45 minutes long large menu and options but i thought i should definitely try pancakes and ended up with the austrian apple walnut pancakes the taste was ok but it was smothered in apple cider compote and whipped cream so much so that it was dripping off my plate not a very appealing appearance the coffee was also not very good maybe it was just my pick but it wasnt very impressivedefinitely not for all the hype we had heard or for waiting in such a long line this was disappointing for mei live across the street and used to go every morning on my way to work not anymore the management could care less about their customers  they are inconsistent some of the staff is awesome some are straight up rude  one of their managers always hides in the back during the rush i dont have time to wait 15 min for a drink on my way to work  my girlfriend and i spent about 6070 a week combined there but now maybe 20 a month tops  enough was enough id rather go to the bean gallery or ccs on metairie road they need new management and a gm that caresim really disappointed in this place i love boiled seafood and dishes with seafood i really expected more from this place what i experienced was a buffet style service with food that was hot but i definitely would have preferred made to order food with bulk prep like this flavor and food character as well as presentation suffer but the prices certainly didnti wanted to like this place due to convince of location but honestly everything was meh at best from the service to the food i was left feeling disappointed i will say everyone was nice and polite just didnt seem to have to togetherjust so overpriced  i want to like this place but please bring your prices down 5 for a savory breakfast croissant 4 for a chocolate croissant i usually avoid coming but every time i do i have to blink three times when they tell me my totalim very willing to change this review  i really hope i can rate it higher   very soon   the boyfriend was craving wings so off we went  he got garlic mild wings i got mild boneless wings   his sauce was really delicious   it was very flavorful   my boneless wings came out cold and chewy   i was starving and craving something bad for me and only ate two out of five boneless wings   thats where we are at  that being said  other things looked great cheesesteaks coming out looked yummo   pizzas looked hot and cheesy   but as we are riding home im starting to feel queazy  im just warning you    i so noticed people around me had gotten the wrong food the food runners were in and out not sure where food was going    the place in general is huge but the space isnt used efficiently   there are tables around the bar but no wait service there    i was just really confused about a lot of things going on there  i hadnt been here before and was at their old location about 10 yeas ago but only for beverages once    ill try again but i will not be getting chicken again   blechwould never order from here again got hung up on before trying to give my card information the food was cold asked for salt pepper  ketchup on fries and chicken there was a little squirt on the fries barely any salt and pepper on anything i was given chicken wings which were so dried out seemed like i got what was left in the fry basket at the end of the night tried to season them and dip them in dressing wasnt even worth it poor dog didnt even want them ended up trashing it the cheesesteak is the only thing i would recommendthis buffet leaves a lot to be desired i find that if you order off of the menu you will have a much better experiencepreviously ive purchased pretzels here they have been fresh  when i stopped by on saturday i purchased pretzels that tasted cold and stale like they were frozen and then thawed out certainly not fresh and warm like most other philly pretzel factorys id think twice before stopping there againwhat a jokeminuscule portions14 for four small shrimp8 for a sliver of iceberg6 bits of bacon and magnifying glass needed specks of blue cheese crumbles but wait 10 split plate fee to cut a filet that is a la carte in halfwtf oversilly us also ordered asparagusit was totally old and shriveledcould this be because they had pretty much no business on a friday night this place is not italian it is an overpriced steakhouse the service was excellent the filet was very good and the prices and portions are insane go to sterlingsdo not waste your money hereme and my wife used to go to this place quite often2 timesweek few years back for their different types of kabobs and their good menu the food was decent and the manager nice   it all stopped when we took their coupon from that current years entertainment guide and they said they dont accept it knowing pretty well we are frequent visitors and the coupon was actually printed in that guide after some discussion they said they will accept it and when they brought the bill the prices of our items were all jacked up to compensate for the coupon not sure how they could shamelessly do it since the actual prices were clearly listed in the menu its been 4 years since this happened and we never went back 10 years back they could have gotten away with it but there is no dearth of good indian restaurants in the western suburbs horrible customer service and dont let anyone tell you this was done by the old management it was the new managementold management was worse than thisim so upset i order the frappes with white chocolate and caramel but i ended not liking it i ordered it once before and it was really good but this time it was just nasty i cant get myself to even drink it and i asked the waitress if i can switch it out and they told me no how is a restaurant going to force something on a customer if they dont like it u lost a very good customergot two things a meatball sub and a cheese pizza  the sub was ok good flavor tasty soft roll and was fresh  very little sauce or cheese though  the paper they wrapped it in stuck to the little cheese there was   the pizza was no better then frozen stuff from the supermarket  i showed up 20 minuts ofter ordering it on the phone and had my first slice five minuts after that  it tasted like it was an hour old  the crust was crunchy and stale  for 15 bucks for a plain pie it should be much better  the only reason i gave it 2 stars was for the fresh bread and good meatballs in the sub  that plus the fresh salad that came with the sub made that part keeping the meal from being a total disastersince theyve switched castle coffee i no longer like their espresso drinks castle coffee has a sour taste to it that i do not care for the croissants are dense and heavy instead of flaky and light they have had some unique pastries that are refreshing if they had more vegetarian pastries that are savory instead of sweet i might come backthe food is so bland my bacon cheeseburger had zero taste to it and same with the sweet potato fries not worth the price for flavorless fooddefinitely not worth all the hype or the long wait its cute but its just pancakes i would suggest going to the biscuit house in east nashville cheaper easier and super tastythis is not a review on einsteins food which is quite good and i enjoy it this is a review on the restaurantservice   we placed our order which took a long time as the two people running the registerfront counter struggled to ring up two sandwiches and a coffee they eventually got it so we found a table  this was a slow sunday late morning there wasnt really a line but by the time we got the food which required us going to the counter and asking what was taking so long there was a line of people waiting for food 56 orders deep no idea what made the preparers soooo slow but ive never waited that long at an einsteins or panera or such   the icing on the cake was that they were out of coffeethough they said they had another pot already brewed that was not the case as they proceeded to then start brewing another potwings were not awesome bbq sauce lacks flavor the breading was too much and the meat was meh the fries were good and service came with a smile may try their cheesesteak but would not give the wings a second chancevisited nashville for the holiday weekend and everyone said this place is worth the wait waited 45 minutes to be seated and another 45 for food to come got there at 9am saturday morning had the georgia peach pancakes and the peach compote was cold that made the pancakes cold so i had cold soggy pancakes that i didnt even want to eat also couldnt ask if it was supposed to be cold because our waitress never came back until she brought the check my boyfriend liked the grill chefs platter but it was average to me i say use a pancake box mix and put your own interesting toppings on them for way less money and time or any dinerwe are first timers we canceled our berns reservation to come here instead for our anniversary  let me start by saying the restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff were all great and knowledgeable of menu items  personally i am mexican and i already knew coming in we would not be getting authentic mexican food i suspected tex mex which was fine  honestly i dont know if we even got texmex  i honestly left confused about the food items and presentation of food items  1st a kids quesadilla was ordered for my son and it came out as 2 corn tacos with chicken and cheese in it i immediately said thats a quesadilla and he said yes okay then  i ordered the chicken iron tacos which are meant to make your own tacos i also ordered a side of mexican style street corn the grilled chicken looked like tyson chicken strips on a skillet with melted cheese and pico it tasted no better than the tyson chicken in the bag then you got corn tortillas in a brown bag for your shell the corn it was mediocre and had some different taste to it  my husband ordered a watermelon drink it was nice and strong he also ordered pastor tacos it didnt even come close to the real deal al pastor which is very difficult to make it was like sliced pork strips on a cast iron to make your own tacos  rice and black beans are provided to the table in these cute jars rice is white with no flavor nothing mexican about it in my opinion the black beans did have some flavor however in traditional mexican or texmex you see pinto beans or refried beans   the complimentary salsa and chips were good salsa hot and mildly spicy   the complimentary churros were hard and very bland   they provided worry dolls  no verbal history provided about them but given as a keepsake   we were given a complimentary tres leche cake not sure why we didnt say anything about the food but i will say that was the best item at the restaurant the cake was moist and the cream was a little bitter tasting but pairs well with the cake and strawberries   overall like stated before i left confused i dont know if we ordered the wrong menu items or this is just an odd restaurant im pretty certain we will not be back as i honestly feel somewhere like chilis or chipotle has better food if not looking for authentic mexican   its a beautiful restaurant but it just wasnt for us  1   for the beauty  1   for the caketook about 25 minutes for all of us to get our food  some of us got sick after eating here not sure whythe place was a mess and it was dirty the tables needed to be wipe down  we only came here since it was the only thing open at 10pm on a friday nightvery plain its a shame its attached to such a nice hotel the atmosphere and decor was cool  the floor seemed slippery the menu looked very good but the food was just plain not good not bad just plain and my sweet potatoes fries were very burnt inedible  waiter was friendly but i was out of water for most of the mealruh roh i tried the sushi buffet its probably what you expect from a sushi buffet thats 10 bucks especially when you hit it up 30 minutes before closing whoops   its nice they also serve rice miso soup and noodle dishes though i probably wouldnt try it again   i do still like ru sans if only because i live nearby and enjoy their udon noodle soups for less than 10awesome building and great cocktails but the food was dreadful it was way too expensive for the quality of food we got i probably wont ever go back to eatcute place but donuts were almost flavorless the dough was lackluster i had maple bacon and my husband had boston cream maple bacon was okay but the boston cream had no flavor at all we also tried the nitro coffee brew which i enjoyed maybe it was the donuts on that day but they look better than they taste i think they tried to think of unique and interesting flavors but fell short in actually perfecting their recipesi wouldnt really recommend eating here per se your money is always undoubtedly spent better elsewhere however cosi is really not a bad spot to meet someone for coffee at not to say the coffee is good but its alright plenty of seats and reasonable decor make it halfdecentread a bad review of this place while sitting there and unfortunately it was dead on not the cleanest unknowledgeable and generally unhelpful staff didnt even get to the food because they were out of the first 2 things i attempted to order so i cut my losses at the mostly orange juice light on the champagne mimosai have this one on watch for now  a long long time favorite this was my goto brisket spectacular  on a recent saturday it appears more than one cook has his fingers in the mix  and perhaps an eye off the ball  as with any successful restaurant consistency is a huge part of what brings customers back  predictability  you have a certain memory of flavor and taste  when its missing a little  ok we all have a bad day  when its missing allot something is awry    the brisket had way too much rub too little smoke and either sat outside its requisite wrap too long or sat ready to serve too long  the ribs  ditto  dry  very very dry  a refrain from other commenters here  sides drooping below expected quality  creamed spinach  wateryrunny   cheddar grits  same  corn casserole  seemed days old  however though every crafted cervesa on the flight shined bright it wasnt enough to save the meal  we had out of towners with us and the long trip to this destination was a disappointment  add to that with a 35 full space the kitchen couldnt muster a 1520 minute turn steam table to dining table  the wait was 35 minutes laborious   my guess ill try again in six to eight monthsi went to check this place out based on a recommendation from a friend we went during there lunch buffet 1130 am to 230 pm we arrived around 145 pm and noticed immediately that the food was not being replaced very quickly we picked up some sushi pieces which tasted pretty good scale out of 10 i would give it a 5 and asked them when they would replenish the buffet and the waitress looked at the clock and said they werent going too any more it was now 205 pm the waitress was kind enough to say if i wanted something more that was at the buffet that i could ask for it i did and the chef who was already sitting at a table eating lunch got up to make some more food i appreciated that but i expected that if a buffet last till 230then there should be food out and fresh  appearance of ru sans sushi from the outside looks like a cool place and then you walk in and get disappointed its not very clean and just not what you expect for the area of town in nashville   i dont think we will be going back here again if we would have read reviews before going i dont think we would have wenta lot of good fancy stuff  everything is expensive here  if buy your stuff here to cook i think its cheaper ordering outrye done wrong i bought a loaf at the bells market and expected real jewish rye what a mistake this bread is sliced too thin dry as a bone and it falls apart i may have gotten 2 complete slices out of the loaf the rest of it fell apart i will not buy this bread again cause its crapabsolutely disgusting cold shawrma sandwich that couldnt take more than 2 bites   not recommended at allgiving this 2 stars but its really 25 we sat down were told our server would be right over but it was a while before anyone tended to us then the waitress took our drink order a bottle of san pellegrino  a glass of sangria  how hard could this be to bring but it took a long time to bring these drinks and therefore even longer to take our food order   nearly an hour later we still had no food and yet patrons at other tables who came in after us were getting their plates what we didnt understand about this was that some of the dishes we ordered couldnt have been that hard to prepare white bean salad for example is a cold salad  its unlikely that its made to order we also ordered 3 sets of skewers chicken lamb  shrimp again though these were cooked they should already be prepped  ready to throw on the grill this is tapas  small plates that are meant to be brought to the table as theyre ready what was taking so long and why hadnt our server come to our table with an update an apology an offer to refill our drinks or god forbid a complimentary something to nosh on while we waited for our meal  as it turned out all our food was brought out at once the ridiculously oversized plates could barely fit on our tiny table for two and some of the hot food was tepid by the time we could even eat it all of this made for a very disappointing dining experience and although a few of our dishes tasted quite delicious they werent worth the wait and poor service we will not be returning to this restaurant again there are just too many other lovely dining choices in media with kitchens that seem to care about their customersheard a lot of good stuff about this place from my brother who frequented their joints in nm maybe after hearing it talked up so much my expectations were too high for blakes to meet either way the burger left a ton to be desired the service was mediocre the inside of the building was nice though so there is that i will give them another shot at some point hopefully they manage to put a little flavor in the burger instead of relying on the pile of chilis on topthe service has really gone down the cashier and manager in duty today are not the brightest i hope they build one closer to mewe were recommended by the waitress to try california king crab at 25lb when we were asking for the rock crab at 28 each we agreed to order the king crab which we were told to be 25 lbs when we got the crab i think its no way to be 25 lbs even before cooking it tasted okay but not as good or fresh as i expected there may be other dishes worth trying but not the king crabno ribs and no biscuits  i heard the food was good here  the people who worked her were grouchy and the food was cold  it was as a little pricey toohad a couple of experiences here the staff was very lazy and unhelpful i asked for a product under lock and they said the only guy with a key would be back in 20 minutes maybe  see ya  total wine has a better selection better staff and will price match anything bevmo haswe felt very unwelcome here i asked for a flight of beer and the gentleman told me i had to buy 6when i went to pay he told me it would be 25 i thought surely i was paying for the 6 pack and he flight together nope that was another 12 boo   do not come herehow does this place have four stars ive had better meals from sara lee had the lobster pasta i dont understand how something can be both overseasoned and bland at the same time the pasta and lobster were overcooked the linguini was  limp and mushy and the lobster was tough and flavorless im seriously baffled by how someone can manage to make lobster not taste good that takes real talent i couldve made something better at home with the same ingredients even the guys next to us left half their plates uneaten behind only upside is that the wait staff seemed sincere slammed but sincere wish i had nicer things to sayi dont love it here the food is mediocre at best the menu is tiny and there is only one burger and its not a regular lettucetomato cheese burger the burger i got today off the special fourth of july menu  so i realize its a little different than the normal menu but why further limit your burger selection on the fourth the regular menu didnt include any burgers  was a single 3 oz patty i asked if it could be cooked medium and was told that it would arrive medium to medium well as it was too small to cook to  preference medium well but its 15 and i would really prefer medium i didnt say that bc the server seemed mad that i would ask for a specific temperature so i asked if i could have fries instead of the sides that were included potato salad corn cob and chips and was told no but i could order a side of fries in addition to the sides that i didnt want so not easy to order burger and fries on the fourth   the burger that arrived tiny as indicated was covered in pickles and onions so that you could barely taste the meat and was really salty my husband got the pork sandwich and it was a mess covered in the sauce that comes with it it fell apart immediately and was not well seasoned the fries he got werent seasoned either   ive eaten here before and those experiences were better but i havent had a good experience yet i thought that pk was supposed to be so amazing with really good burgers  i really love burgers  but how can that be true when only one is on the menu and it doesnt even come with a tomato i think thats so weird   it is a beautiful restaurant and might be ok for drinks only especially with big open windows and outside seating the beer menu looked accommodating and there were more than a couple wines by the glass but the lackluster messy food combined with servers who seemed annoyed from the moment you walk in made me give it two stars   hopefully ive just had random bad experiences but it will be awhile before i go backthe dq in springfield tennessee is a mess these employees arent that damn busy management dont see this the employees here dont care about their jobs enough to clean up makes me wonder how safe it is to eat the food the picture only shows a small portion of the mess im not coming backwe had a reservation at 815 it was busy three out of five of us ordered oysters on the half shellvery good one ordered a crab cakecold our dinners were served at 930 the fish stew was cold fried oysters with a small saladoysters were cold three burgersordered 2 med rare and one rare ended up with 2 med and one med well the manager took off the cost of one burger and gave us 20 off the bill very nicebut get this they added 20 gratuity onto the bill what the salad was redone and was delicious the stew was heated up and returned in a potok but would we return noreview summary if you want an expensive selection with amazing staff and a welcoming environment total wine is less than a mile down the road    i have never bought from this store because i have a preferred liquor store right across the street from my house but through a search on the internet i had been told they had a certain sake that i have been looking everywhere to buy  we enter the store it looks like they just took a concrete room and set up shelves and hung passer signs from the ceiling letting customers know where each type of alcohol is there are some crude decorations but looks as though they put nearly no time or money into making their place look presentable and i know this is a chain so i was slightly confused it looked as if they had just opened i start searching for sake which is not a marked section a man asks me how im doing and we talk about where the sake is he brings it to me and asks me what im looking for i told him that i found it on the randalls website he condescendingly said to me just because its on a website doesnt mean we will have it in or store  i said i understand that i dont see it is the any way to order it just then who looks to be the manager came up and interrupted to say what are you looking for i told him and he was like and you said someone told you that we have it here i said no i found it on the internet he just stared at me and i said i found it on the randalls website and he interrupted me before i could finish to say in the same tone as the man before him just because its on the internet doesnt mean it will be in our stores i said okay i understand that can you order it he said i dont know i dont know ill be back and comes back after 10 minutes to say that specific bottle isnt anywhere in missouri alright i said ok thank you and he walked awaythis is our third time at the restaurant and unfortunately it wasnt a charm the beer is cold guacamole and chips were good the enchiladas were okay  i expected more for the money spent  its probably best as a drinks and apps place for usvery slow  always never friendly food is the reason i gave it two stars they have good tenders and cheese curds if you want fast and friendly not the place also never open hours are so short also website hours are incorrect so you show up and its closed how freaking unhelpfulim giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 2 star rating  in my eyes its really a 1  but the portion of the fish tacos the beer garden and the overall potential for the place once it gets out of its nubile demo stage merits an extra star  my coworkers and i were super extra salty when the porchs seemingly groundbreaking porch 20 twitter announcement was none other than oh were completely wiping out all the rotating food trucks you loved and replacing them with a single food truck containing the same old food day in and day out  not to mention an awkward rearrangement of seats and benchesmostly all in the hot sun and fake turf no one sits on  great    salty and all we still decided to give it a gander since who knows maybe it would blow us out of the water and become our new favorite goto lunch spot  wrong    for one the menu is super limited  not saying food trucks should ever have more than like 810 items but the fact of the matter is that when the prior food trucks were there and i didnt like something that spot burger had i could hop over to taco mondo or pitruco or kai chi or foolish waffles orthe list is endless  options is what lured the crowds in   now were stuck with a basic bitch menu wings porchetta watermelon salad homemade bbq chips fish tacos burger veggie burger bbq chicken wrap and some other crap not worth mentioning and also not reasonably priced for the quality  at mucho bueno for example i would easily drop 1213 on lunch without regretting it since i knew i was getting good food  and even in those food trucks they would vary up their menu weekly so you were always surprised  the fresh tomatowatermelonfetamint salad is very delicious and healthy but also 7 for essentially just a shit ton of large watermelon chunks  the bbq chips are a hit or miss some days theyre fresh and the dipping sauce is tasty and other days theyre stale and from the bottom of the barrel  the porchetta is not a sandwich but rather a heaping pile of fatty pork meatand both people i knew who had it threw away half because of how inedible the fat became  the fish tacos are fairly tasty large and the portion is worth the 7 but the fish is awkward and square shaped and the tortillas get soggy real quick   maybe ill try the burger next or possibly scope it out for cocktails at happy hour but this is one food truck that should have been left out of the rotationnot impressed i ordered 4 different tacos and they were average to below average they have some unique combinations but thats about it margarita was pretty goodthis place is confounding to me  so am going with hit or miss yet feeling slightly bad about that   first it is uncomfortably loud because they put the music up high and then people talk louder to make up for it i think that surprised me because its so cute inside i expected so much better given the look and feel that they would opt for this   the drinks were okay  the old fashioned was nice but the january special had way too much crushed ice and looked like a beach drink yes in january  the last thing i want in 20 degree weather is an icy drink   service was nice she was frustrated with us understandably because my friend could not decide what to order but attentive and helpful   appetizer squid was fantastic  i would definitely order it again because the celery root and almonds were so tasty my entree risotto was terrible though the rice was not cooked long enough i dont want it mushy but it should not be crunchy and the oysters tasted wrong the whole thing was cold i kind of want my 22 back   overall it is definitely not worth the price if i went back it would be for a drink and an appetizer at the barok bubble tea but only limited variety i have had a few bad bubbles in the past  what is most disappointing is the frozen yogurt  all super sweet varieties even ice cream isnt usually this sweet  expect the common flavors of cake batter red velvet cake and cookies and cream  this place is way better for kids than adults  there are too few frozen yogurt places in town that have the nice clean flavors that should differentiate yogurt from ice cream  they have an ok mix of toppingswent for dinner on a saturday night and ordered their standard burger the american medium rare i ended up being served a dry extremely overcooked meatball sized piece of meat the fries were fine the milkshake was good but if you want an actual hamburger i suggest going somewhere elsegot in there at 745 wait for 15 minute to order 5 people ahead of me and 823 the order is ready staff is loud to each other and yell back and forth for communication and i heard they call each other bixch eyeroll to customer  no table is clean the star is for the food better than the mcdonald in kingshighway and jefferson this use to be my favorite restaurant the food was great i have noticed it has hasnt been the same anymore i went here for my birthday and had the worst experience i think they had a new waitress and the restaurant was pretty empty so i still do not get why we had so many issues first  they never brought us bread and we ordered 2 dinners they brought our food out after 30 minutes and then brought the soup and salad out when we said we didnt want it because we already had our food they could of cared less we spoke with a young manager that i had never seen there before and all he offered was to pack the soup and salad so we can bring it home no apologizes he was more interested in hanging out with staff a real disappointment we use to frequent cd 3 or more times a month when we had guest from out of town we always brought them here too bad it has changed so muchhorrible clam chowder expansive for the quality and amount of food they serve would not recommendhad a poor first experience which is unfortunate because i think the burger had a lot of great flavor and quality ingredients service was the main opportunity for improvement i was the only one in the drive thru with over 8 employees and it took several minutes for someone to come to the window no greeting and filled the wrong soda   meat tasted great and veggies were fresh the chillies are tasty hot i personally would like to see more of them since they are big part of what makes this brand uniquethe sweet potato hash and kombucha were good but i was disgusted when i used their restroom it was dirty and there were flies all overtook 15 minutes to get our order then mine wasnt the right sand which the food was just ok nice atmosphere but we wont be backi went here to have a fun dinner over the holidays with my siblings the place was full but didnt look too busy it took the waitress about 10 minutes to come to our table and take a drink order and over the course of the evening she generally seemed either disinterested or just generally annoyed to be a server i think her name was alissa or melissa was incredibly slow and walked past our table filled with empty app plates repeatedly without clearing them when our main entrees finally arrived she pushed our app plates to the center of the table to make room for our entrees i handed her my plate and asked her to take these away my dinner was the special but it was pretty much just a burrito packed with rice and a few pieces of chicken it sucked everyone else liked their food my brother ordered a beer and she said ok and walked away he had to call her back to ask what beers do you have on tap do you have xyz beer  when we asked for dessert menus and we were given 1 though there were 5 of us at the table id say that was lazy but carrying 5 menus doesnt seem like anymore work than carrying 1 in summary  service sucked food was okayla colombes coffee is quite tastey but their service is seriously lacking the iced latte i ordered was very good  i didnt even need to put sugar in it unfortunately the barista who made and served me my drink was anything but sweet she was impatient and rather rude especially when i wanted to pay using my debit card i did tip her in cash so i dont understand what the ice queen treatment was for to top if off she proceeded to be personable to the next guy in line who ended up not leaving her a tip talk about biting the hand that feeds youreally good service very friendly clean environment i ordered spring rolls and iced green tea the spring rolls were good i especially liked the mint in it the iced green tea thats a different story horrible this drink is beyond a reasonable doubt spoiled i cant get the taste out of my mouth i didnt tell the owners anything because i hate making a scene and i always have the thought of what if they spit in my new drink thought pretty disappointing to say the leastgosh i really wanted to love this place i support privately owned coffee shops over the starbuckstype conglomerates any day   i was excited to try buddy brew but we were disappointed in the product however the stores atmosphere is beautiful   we just came in for cold brew iced coffees i had vanilla added to mine they tasted very burnt and i couldnt finish mine also i could not taste any vanilla the options for milk were only skim or half  half and the sugar bar had raw sugar splenda etc i like the raw sugar but not the crystal form who wants crunchy sugar in their coffee they should have the liquid form available and there should be more options for milk  almond coconut soy etc maybe they have it if you ask but i didnt see it on the menu   the shop is very clean and modern it looks like a nice place to hang out but they need to up their game for a specialized coffee shop id like to see different brews of coffee offered brewed flavors more options for sweetener etcprices are high for mediocre food very disappointed in mealthe clams were stringy not sure where their from the lobster was did not have much flavor or texture again not sure where this food is from dont think it was from new england for sure the food is fair not great or the best though
