the shrimp was mediocre periodtoken overall commatoken i gave it a shot and it wasnt worth the wait and effort parking so i dont see us going back periodtoken","221":"pulled pork sandwich was delicious  periodtoken periodtoken but the lucky bun asian fusion style  burger  periodtoken was a disappointment for the sole purpose of them using a frozen beef patty   the bread was good  periodtoken periodtoken the toppings and sauces were great  periodtoken periodtoken but just killed the flavors with a processed frozen beef patty  periodtoken periodtoken if used a fresh ground meat  periodtoken periodtoken it would have been a great gourmet burger  periodtoken periodtoken","230":"good menu commatoken solid ingredients commatoken but these folks are not sandwich artists periodtoken  i had a turkey and brie wrap one day and the spinach florentine wrap the next periodtoken  both wraps could have more fittingly been called crumples because thats how they were assembled periodtoken  while watching the sandwich line i kept thinking commatoken thank god theyre not trying to fold burritos  everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago periodtoken  also commatoken can we please hang a few signs like order here commatoken pickup here commatoken payhere to direct traffic instead of the east coast if you don already know commatoken then leave attitude","249":"theres been three times that ive ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and

everywhere a lot of places arent over crowded periodtoken the bartenders were just awful periodtoken the service was lacking and the pizza sucked periodtoken   pros they had portopotty 2 put back

you walk up it wasnt that busy commatoken lots of standing around bartenders didnt know what microbrew meant or ipa beers no joke","279":"i love chickfila so much and was so excited to get one down

periodtoken hell periodtoken  apparently nashvillians dont know how to use a double lane drive through periodtoken  and may i ask why the drive thru goes around the front of the restaurant instead of the back of the restaurant like every other damn fast food restaurant  though commatoken kudos for the free wifi that i can use on my phone while im waiting twenty minutes in line at the drive thru periodtoken  so i avoid this place like the plague periodtoken ill wait til next time im in rivergate or cool springs for some amazing waffle fries periodtoken","303":"burger was ok commatoken but not at all worth the price periodtoken i felt cramped sitting at the long table surrounded by people i did not know periodtoken service was ok periodtoken if they brought the prices way down commatoken it

taste and value periodtoken","323":"some of the fare on offer at that bbq place is wildly overpriced commatoken especially given the fact that real cutlery commatoken proper table service commatoken and glassware are all missing periodtoken  while this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service commatoken im unlikely to return periodtoken  it wont matter commatoken though commatoken for its busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed periodtoken  their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking periodtoken  in the end commatoken sherwood parkers seem to like the place and thats all that matters for the owners periodtoken","329":"gets two stars because the service was great and staff was very friendly commatoken food was not very good periodtoken periodtoken maybe we came on a bad day periodtoken i ate there and ordered a togo item for my husband periodtoken i asked the girl working the counter to pick the most popular thing out of

periodtoken for a sat night that should have been a big clue periodtoken the rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy periodtoken the steamed dumplings could have been great periodtoken the tasted homemade and the filling was good periodtoken however commatoken they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling periodtoken everything else went downhill from there periodtoken  the beef and broccoli was inedible periodtoken the beef had an awful weird texture periodtoken like it was boiled and was gelatinous periodtoken  the sauce on it had off flavors periodtoken we literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out periodtoken  the meat in both the general taos chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures periodtoken it was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well periodtoken the flavors in the sauces would have been fine commatoken but they were gloopy periodtoken  the fried rice was fair but

food or a blizzard periodtoken if it is anything other than a blizzard find a different dq periodtoken sadly it seems to be ran by young adults not even out of high school so dont expect the beat they have to offer periodtoken","393":"the food is very good but the ability to turnover the tables is a huge problem on busy days periodtoken waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food periodtoken i just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast periodtoken they do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion periodtoken there were many upset people there due to the time to wait periodtoken while we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when i arrived which we waited an hour to be seated periodtoken the workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed periodtoken management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules periodtoken i will not be coming back due to this experience periodtoken","413":"place has really slipped as far as food quality periodtoken pork steak was dry and tough and i wish

market was open and since we just got back from vaca we thought we would try it periodtoken  first of all commatoken accolades to the staff they could not have been more helpful periodtoken  especially thomas in the meat section periodtoken  for these two things i would give them a five periodtoken  however commatoken it does downhill from this point on  ordered one pound of swiss cheese commatoken after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes commatoken and no one else was on line commatoken the unfriendly clerk waited on us periodtoken the imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese commatoken rather than many slices periodtoken  i bought ricotta cheese for easter and went to open it commatoken and it was bad commatoken although it was dated 328 periodtoken  the tomatoes on the vine that i bought on friday were bad by sunday periodtoken  i have found their prices very high commatoken selection commatoken poor and at this point it is just not worth it periodtoken i also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par periodtoken  very dry and tasteless periodtoken periodtoken overall a very disappointing shopping trip  there is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate commatoken but it is not for me periodtoken  the final straw was that i asked for extra cash for easter gifts commatoken the clerk at the register said there was a 150 limit commatoken the atm terminal said 100 and the manager said 50 periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni thought they should get their

location periodtoken i went for breakfast once and lunch another time periodtoken breakfast was average commatoken same with lunch commatoken which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours periodtoken for the lunch visit commatoken we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich periodtoken the menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich commatoken but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing periodtoken everything was bland and under seasoned periodtoken wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk commatoken but seemed friendly when they approached our table periodtoken food wasnt bad commatoken but the only reason id really go back is because of the location and if i was in a hurry commatoken no other reason to really go back commatoken and i live in the immediate area periodtoken","510":"my fiance and i live in west chester commatoken which has awesome brunch spots commatoken but we were meeting up with some friends so this was a good middle ground periodtoken  this cafe had good reviews commatoken so we figured to give it a shot periodtoken  we were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from periodtoken  the food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable commatoken but nothing out of this world periodtoken  we probably would have considered to go back if it werent for the service periodtoken  immediately after our food was brought to our table commatoken the check was placed down commatoken never asking us if we were going to want anything additional periodtoken  we sat down at 1100am commatoken the food came out pretty quickly commatoken but by 1200pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner periodtoken  there were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down commatoken but for some reason it had to be our table periodtoken  i could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line commatoken but there were several open tables and only 5 people not groups waiting to be seated periodtoken  we were meeting up with friends we had not seen in a while and it was unfortunate to be rushed out after only an hour periodtoken  needless to say commatoken we will not be back","512":"im being generous by giving this restaurant 2 stars periodtoken the service was so appalling that the fact that the food was actually ok is this places only saving grace periodtoken i think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening periodtoken we were never greeted after we were seated periodtoken we had to ask the maitred if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked periodtoken once we finally ordered commatoken we were out of water periodtoken after asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived periodtoken and from that point until after we received our food commatoken we never saw our waiter again periodtoken i asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came periodtoken finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when i told him i didnt want it any more commatoken he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket periodtoken not my problem we were never asked if we wanted dessert commatoken we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didnt need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience periodtoken as if he was going to get a tip in the first place periodtoken getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did periodtoken i would say commatoken dont expect a lot from this mediocre italian place periodtoken","523":"was not a fan of their cheesesteak periodtoken their wiz sauce was mustard based and it was not terrible as a sandwich itself but mustard is not the flavor one expects or wants in a cheesesteak periodtoken it was overwhelming and not good periodtoken","530":"love the greek salad periodtoken pizza is above average periodtoken service ranges from okay to worst on the face of the planet periodtoken","552":"nice staff commatoken but the

gardens and homes to look at duh so just enjoy the stroll periodtoken  im not applying this towards my overall scoring but im noting it so you know that i know that you know what the dealio is periodtoken  atmosphere dead silent periodtoken  seriously periodtoken  so periodtoken  freaking periodtoken  quiet periodtoken  if you need to study then youve found a winner  if you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot periodtoken  when i walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because i made an actual loud noise and it startled them periodtoken  not the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity  chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest periodtoken   after i got my coffee from the huffy barista more on that in the next section because i should really review the product  service i got i chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness periodtoken  that was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone periodtoken  in a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church commatoken his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker periodtoken  look commatoken im nosy but i try to make it look like im not obviously nosy but it wouldnt have mattered here periodtoken  this guy really got into it and wouldnt have noticed if the roof fell in periodtoken  he certainly didnt notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a very personal phone call periodtoken  after a few minutes i gave up pretending i wasnt watching and took in the show periodtoken  after ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call commatoken heaved numerous sighs and helped them with the same care hed given me periodtoken  spoiler alert it wasnt indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude periodtoken  i watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit periodtoken  not really relaxing commatoken ya  service i asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if i wanted medium commatoken dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me periodtoken  if you dont know what you want in the first 2 seconds then theyll just make up your mind for you periodtoken  okkkkkkk periodtoken  i watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too periodtoken  this guy wasnt really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasnt obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job periodtoken  everyone has a bad day but dont take it out out on the customer to the extreme periodtoken  i mean commatoken you dont have to kiss my butt but dont be all huffy and do not pick my coffee for me without asking periodtoken  rude periodtoken  coffee it was good periodtoken  not great periodtoken  not mindblowing periodtoken  good periodtoken  not as hot as i prefer but more heat than tepid periodtoken  i ended up pouring about 14 out because i got some grounds in the finish periodtoken  i couldnt find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask remember commatoken my first time here and being ignored i just used a straw periodtoken  i hate to drink fairtrade coffee that wasnt my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when i dont have to periodtoken  other i didnt eat so no word on that periodtoken  bathrooms were clean enough periodtoken  great restaurants nearby periodtoken  i really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room commatoken the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch periodtoken  just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark periodtoken","561":"as far as cheese goes commatoken they have a good selection commatoken but i would usually go next door periodtoken  the mozzerela is good commatoken but often times sold out periodtoken  i believe they only make cows milk and not buffalo mozzerela commatoken which is not my favorite periodtoken for bread commatoken again i would go next door as well periodtoken for groceries commatoken they have the best stock in the market periodtoken  however the prices are pretty bad periodtoken  if you are in a jam and need a single italian cooking ingredient commatoken they probably have it commatoken but youre probably over paying periodtoken the staff is very friendly and helpful periodtoken  they hang a lot of meat at the counter commatoken so the interaction at the counter is awkward because youre looking around hanging meat periodtoken","584":"i used to love to go to this place back in the late 1980s when it was on pine street periodtoken then it was a great place for brunch and ice cream periodtoken when i took my children to the current location a few weeks ago commatoken we had small ice cream cones that were overpriced and the staff was not terribly helpful periodtoken the person who waited on me left my receipt with credit card info periodtoken sitting on the counter while she disappeared outside to pick up lunch down the street periodtoken however commatoken the real turnoff is the price periodtoken go to franklin fountain instead they have a better selection at more reasonable prices in a more attractive setting periodtoken","598":"we discovered this place on our gps at the last minute so i didnt have time to yelp it since my phone doesnt have the app for it periodtoken anyways commatoken this place is inside a nice place on the

looking at me funny the whole time i asked her anything periodtoken the rest of the time she tried to ignore me for no particular reason periodtoken wth   on the bright side commatoken the margaritas were huge and blended just the way i like it periodtoken they had lots of good flavors to choose from like pineapple commatoken banana commatoken strawberry commatoken mango commatoken and a few other fruity flavors periodtoken at the time we were there commatoken only one other table was occupied periodtoken i got the fried grouper sandwich which is a popular fish in fl periodtoken it was just ok periodtoken the service was slow and the waitress was weird periodtoken she asked my husband if hed like more water a few times but ignored me completely periodtoken i dont know why she was giving me an attitude as i wasnt rude to her at all periodtoken   whatever commatoken mean woman haters like her suck periodtoken the grouper sandwich was 9 periodtoken95 periodtoken fries didnt come with the

that my husband got was 5 periodtoken95 for a large bowl periodtoken and the key lime pie which tasted like lime cheesecake cost 5 periodtoken95 periodtoken the inside of the place is cute and there is an outdoor patio that faces the beach periodtoken also commatoken there is a bar outside periodtoken if you decide to eat here commatoken dont order the grouper sandwich commatoken it sucked and was dry but since i was hungry commatoken i ate it periodtoken the margaritas were good though periodtoken","599":"the food is ok commatoken but is ruined by the awful atmosphere periodtoken  two of the employees calling each other faggots and the deafening rap music with every other word being motherfr made it seem that they wanted customers to leave periodtoken  order carryout or eat outside

presentation periodtoken  the arroz con pollo i ordered came to my table artfully arranged on my plate periodtoken  and it was delicious commatoken as was every part of my order periodtoken  why the two stars  as it seems others know all too well commatoken the service was abysmal periodtoken  on one occasion commatoken we waited interminably for a table commatoken only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party commatoken when there had been two seats available the whole time    once we were served commatoken the waitstaff ignored us periodtoken  this place

there periodtoken  plenty of street parking available within a blocks range periodtoken  staff were friendly but that doesnt compensate for the taste periodtoken  didnt really live up to my expectations i must say periodtoken maybe i had high expectations to begin with periodtoken","729":"i tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like sprinkles commatoken but unfortunately i must say that i prefer sprinkles to the flying cupcakes periodtoken first commatoken visually commatoken the frostingtocupcake ratio is too small periodtoken  i like eating cake with frosting periodtoken  i dont want to eat too much of cake without frosting periodtoken  second commatoken im not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake periodtoken  they overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting periodtoken  third commatoken and this is the biggest negative commatoken the frosting does not melt in the mouth  its too thick and hard commatoken which means when you eat the cake with the frosting commatoken they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together periodtoken you might as well eat them separately periodtoken   i only tried their red velvet cupcake commatoken and maybe their other flavors are better commatoken but i think i make better cupcakes at home commatoken and i have certainly had much better cupcakes from

get the cobb salad commatoken so i returned to reminisce periodtoken unfortunately commatoken either my taste buds changed or their chefs got bad periodtoken it is a mediocre spot commatoken similar to panera and cosi periodtoken","784":"service and coffee is not what it used to be periodtoken i went every morning on my way into work for the last year periodtoken recently ive been driving further

and atmosphere periodtoken  the first day i went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away periodtoken  the food came out fast for how many people were there periodtoken  however commatoken it lacked any real flavor periodtoken  camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend periodtoken  the seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and

got the steak sandwich with the french onion soup periodtoken the place was clean and presentable i would recommend the restaurant periodtoken the only issue i had was the guy taking my order he needs

everything else was as good as you can expect in a chain but after this experience i think ill keep on looking periodtoken","865":"it pains me to write this commatoken but i fear i must periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i used to really enjoy pk as a lively neighborhood spot with elevated pub food periodtoken but yesterday in the early evening commatoken the place was overrun with drunken

periodtoken  i found their chicken to be dry and a bit tasteless periodtoken the gravy wasnt great either periodtoken in all honesty commatoken this place didnt really have a chance because from the moment i stepped in i was comparing it to kfc in every aspect and i love kfc when it comes to things chicken related periodtoken   overall everything here is just sub par periodtoken nothing to write home about and nothing to even recommend periodtoken","965":"food commatoken was great had bbq nacho as an appetizer commatoken great beer selection and great value for the price periodtoken only bad

suggested ice cream commatoken and this was the place closest to the restaurant periodtoken  the cafe area that housed the desserts was charming though in need of some refurbishing the entire area looked worn down periodtoken  the ice cream was soso periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni could get the same quality product at a grocery store periodtoken plus commatoken the ice cream melted entirely too quickly periodtoken my dining companion wasnt blown away by her selection either periodtoken in addition to ice cream commatoken there were other baked goods  apple pie commatoken peanut butter pie commatoken etc periodtoken but they didnt appear all that appealing investing in nicer display cases might help periodtoken   i would give this place another shot since one visit doesnt mean mtjic isnt worth it commatoken but ill only stop by if im in the area periodtoken","976":"yummy but the staff refused to make a frappacino i have ordered at least three times before at the same location and at least fifty times before in my lifetime at other locations periodtoken also she didnt get half my order then while we waited for it she lectured me about how old my request was

times periodtoken","1017":"very underwhelmed im confused on the high ratings so im wondering if we were here on an off day periodtoken good smoked salmon commatoken croissants periodtoken bad everything else periodtoken here are the highlights waiter was confused and didnt know brunch menu very well periodtoken menu said ask waiter for french toast and eggs benedict periodtoken waiter says thats not the case but hed be willing to go to the bar and get for us periodtoken carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed periodtoken buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same commatoken as did many of the dishes which was odd periodtoken with amazing brunch options like mere bulles commatoken copper kettle commatoken ellendales commatoken etc commatoken id advise you to bypass this place periodtoken did i mention we never got our drinks refilled and they bussed our table midmeal","1050":"this place really isnt that good periodtoken the atmosphere is sweet commatoken but the food is mediocre at best periodtoken im always disappointed when i type in middle eastern and

periodtoken i would have been happy with any seasoning periodtoken the sub was also packed with beef periodtoken my husband said it was decent sub periodtoken we are both going to go there again maybe during the day when the kitchen is busy and items are fresher periodtoken","1126":"it was ok  commatoken i wont be going back commatoken people coming up to the table passing out flyers disrespectful the waitress not remembering our order commatoken just messy periodtoken one and done periodtoken","1130":"i agree with some of the previous reviews commatoken which are less than satisfactory periodtoken  the drivethrough was defectively designed and constructed   it is too narrow and too winding periodtoken it shouldnt be too hard to reconstruct it to make it easier to get through periodtoken more importantly commatoken the customer service needs to be improved periodtoken  i went there recently and ordered coffee commatoken and clearly stated that i wanted it with no sugar periodtoken  the girl at the window handed me the coffee commatoken which was loaded with sugar periodtoken  i went through again commatoken and asked for what i ordered periodtoken  another employee gave me another coffee commatoken made as i originally ordered commatoken but she made no apology commatoken and seemed annoyed periodtoken this is at least the second time that i received an incorrect order at this location periodtoken the other three mcdonalds locations i go to commatoken in less prestigious neighborhoods commatoken have much better customer service periodtoken","1137":"food was excellent commatoken server was good periodtoken had purchased a groupon 35 off bill earlier that day commatoken as we were leaving town the next day periodtoken when we went to pay the bill commatoken the server told us that she couldnt find our groupon and we had to write down the voucher number for her periodtoken a few minutes later commatoken the manager came to the table and said your groupon isnt in our system so you cant use it and walked away periodtoken we had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it periodtoken again commatoken the manager was very rude and just said what does your groupon say it says you have to have a reservation and walked away again periodtoken so commatoken yes commatoken the fine print said reservations required commatoken but this is not the type of place i can see anyone making a reservation commatoken and they never mentioned that until they couldnt find it in the system periodtoken also commatoken i would have been fine with this if the manager had handled it politely periodtoken his immediate aggressive attitude was very insulting and made it ver uncomfortable to the other guests who werent paying for the bill periodtoken","1174":"ordered online through yelp and got roast beef hoagie with extra swiss cheese periodtoken i got the sandwich and it had american on it and only a few slices periodtoken so i call them up and describe the mix up periodtoken the guy on the phone says we dont have swiss despite it being an option on the online order form periodtoken and when i asked why he didnt call to let me know commatoken he said oh someone probably tried to call you periodtoken i had no missed calls on my phone commatoken so that obviously was a lie periodtoken then i asked about the extra cheese that i ordered and he said all sandwiches get two slices of cheese commatoken and extra cheese means you get three slices periodtoken  i told him that our definition of extra cheese is very different periodtoken id like to say ill never order from here again commatoken but they have good food just shitty customer service periodtoken","1175":"poor at best periodtoken had the odd mixtos taco plate periodtoken a few pieces of meat set in and inch deep of bubbling cheese in a small square super hot skillet periodtoken i picked out the meat which was there small portion periodtoken disappointed at the price also periodtoken  20 bucks for bad tacos periodtoken   i did not say it out loud but the word came to mind as i pushed the plate away periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengarbage periodtoken not trying to be rude commatoken but being honest periodtoken  if you are looking for authentic mexican food commatoken you will most likely want to skip by this one periodtoken  very disneyesque it its mexican appearance periodtoken all style commatoken no substance periodtoken","1204":"this place has been featured on the food network which for me is a red flag periodtoken  oftentimes commatoken these places are way over hyped and arent really that good periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken this was the case for the pancake pantry periodtoken  i am a pancake connoisseur and i can usually tell a good pancake by  looking at it periodtoken yes commatoken im that good periodtoken  one look at these pancakes and i had their number periodtoken they were fluffy and doughy commatoken much like the ones at mcdonalds or any number of short order diners in the country periodtoken  i personally like my pancakes with a light crisp edge commatoken which usually means they have been cooked in butter commatoken and they should be tasty before any butter or syrup is added periodtoken not true of the pancake pantry periodtoken just ok periodtoken milquetoast even periodtoken  good bacon though periodtoken","1230":"after reading the reviews we decided to try it out periodtoken  waited about 12  hour and was seated at a dirty table with remnants of left over breakfast and on one of the chairs too periodtoken  told the waiter and she hurriedly wiped it down but the table was still sticky periodtoken ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with no cheese and hubby ordered the big easy periodtoken   sandwich came out with cheese on it and had to send it back commatoken hubbys eggs were under down periodtoken  asked the waitress if the egg whites are suppose to be raw and really runny and she huffily said yes periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmmmm okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhad eggs at our restaurant establishments and when they make it over easy the egg whites are not raw and runny periodtoken after that commatoken waitress didnt check up on us during our entire meal periodtoken wouldnt go back periodtoken","1254":"the food is over rated commatoken its good commatoken but not as to die for as everyone has told me periodtoken this italian market  deli combo is jam packed with stuff everywhere commatoken making it nearly impossible to wait in line to order on an average day without touching anyone around you or anyone trying to press through to the patio periodtoken i am very uncomfortable with strangers pushing me around while i try to figure out what food should be ordered at which counter commatoken struggling to glimpse the options behind the glass commatoken and understand what the ordering process is and which convoluted line is the one i need to be in periodtoken the people taking the orders are not helpful in making the process clear commatoken assuming everyone has been here before and knows the deal periodtoken they dont say commatoken for here or to go so they can heat up the food for you commatoken they dont have a clear spot at any of the counters for customers to go up to without having to push their way through a series of people who might have already ordered commatoken could be waiting to order commatoken or are trying to figure out what to order commatoken theres no way to tell one crowd from the other periodtoken when you eventually figure it out the first time around and get your food commatoken you might have ordered multiple items commatoken but theres no trays to make sure you can carry all of the food out to the pay station and then to the patio commatoken or bags for to go ordersim pretty sure if you asked for one they could get one commatoken but i should not have to ask commatoken especially with my hand in a cast so you guard yourself against bumps as best you can to hope the food you waited so uncomfortably for doesnt get knocked out of your hands commatoken forget trying to make a single trip for food and drinks commatoken you wont make it periodtoken speaking of their coffee bar theyre always super busy commatoken scrambling around commatoken and i got skipped over while waiting to order my drinks commatoken then it proceeded to take about 810 minutes to get my drinks and pay for them commatoken all whilst growing ever more hungry with each passing minute periodtoken the pizza looked really good commatoken especially the chicken and vodka pizza commatoken but it wasnt very flavorful and its all extremely messy to eat periodtoken the patio space is very limited commatoken so you might have to wait to get a seat commatoken or have a seat taken while you go inside for the necessary second trip periodtoken the mist fans are a good concept commatoken but it does nothing but agitate me further as i try to keep napkins on the table commatoken the parchment paper from under certain foods commatokensuch as pizza and pastries commatoken from flying away or up in the way as we ate commatoken and keeping my hair out of my face and food as the water droplets blow directly on everything periodtoken being in a group with a friend in a wheelchair was difficult commatoken we had to somehow clear a space through the mass of indifferent people packed into the store from the front door to the back commatoken with too few handicap spaces having to park in the rear of the parking lot periodtoken as a disabled veteran myself commatoken the overwhelming environment made me uneasy commatoken and the invasion of my personal space made me anxious and extremely uncomfortable periodtoken add this to the inaccessibility of the entrance and exit due to the sheer volume of people going in and out of the limited doors and the maze of a parking lot through which my handicapped friend had to go through as cars pulled in and out without regard for their surroundings commatoken and it is a logistical nightmare periodtoken i will not be returning despite my groups general enjoyment of the food and their continuing patronage periodtoken the systems in place to get the food they enjoymostly the pastries are frustrating to them but they can overlook it periodtoken i cannot periodtoken","1271":"i wanted to like izumi but didnt periodtoken the hostwaiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue periodtoken for the price i found the portion size to be very small periodtoken  when paying 13 for a roll i expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree periodtoken  the sea weed salad was nasty  although i felt like the waiter prepared us for the  others must have complained periodtoken the ginger chicken took a long time to cook but i am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink periodtoken  the flavor was ok but for 21 i would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken periodtoken it was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt periodtoken the saltiness was so overpowering that you couldnt taste anything else periodtoken  as someone who lived in japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven i was underwhelmed by izumi periodtoken","1278":"the chick that works here is seriously retarded periodtoken spacey as fck commatoken dosent pay attention commatoken and cant take an order periodtoken   its iv commatoken so cant expect much periodtoken   the pho was a little funky periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken wanst a huge fan of the broth commatoken but it had a lot of veggies and tofu in it commatoken so i was fairly satisfied periodtoken   iced coffee was good periodtoken   meh periodtoken","1288":"ill get to you when i can not the best way to greet paying customers periodtoken if it was actually busy i could understand the servers frustration but it was dead in there at 4 in the afternoon periodtoken pouring beers cant be that stressful periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken thankfully the young lady at the counter was helpful periodtoken","1295":"asked my husband on his way home this evening from work to stop by taco bell to grab me an order of nachos bell grande with chicken and guacamole periodtoken so he brought it home and i was excited to eat it commatoken as i started digging through all this goodness i realized there were only but 67 whole chips in this entire plate commatoken the rest were a bunch of bits and pieces of chips commatoken sort of the last bits at the bottom of the bagcontainer periodtoken i would hope whoever assembled this plate of nachos would realize that the bits and pieces of chips defeats the entire purpose of this meal periodtoken disappointed hopefully they can do better periodtoken","1389":"i really am not sure how subway maintains restaurants in the philadelphia area when there are so many good hoagie places out

periodtoken the dough and sauce actually have no flavor periodtoken its too bad periodtoken i was so excited to have a good fast pizza place but this is not that periodtoken","1417":"this is the second time we tried turning point at this location periodtoken the first time we had a long wait for food after ordering commatoken this time we had an even longer wait of over 40 minutes periodtoken i had the omelette skillet and there was hardly any egg in it commatoken i felt like i was eating chopped onions and chopped tomatoes periodtoken my wife had a blt and had a hard time finding the tomato and the avocado that was supposed be on it periodtoken overall commatokenthe experience was stressful commatoken mainly because of the long wait periodtoken","1420":"i visited this location on several occasions this last week and was thoroughly disappointed on every visit periodtoken from employees too busy joking with each other to help customers commatoken to waiting for my drink because they made the drinks and food for their regulars first to having an employee offer to help commatoken then walked away from the counter to go do something else commatoken which resulted in my having to bet back into line and wait again periodtoken my vanilla latte is what you would expect from a starbucks commatoken consistent and good commatoken but the customer service will keep me from coming back periodtoken","1429":"checker was very rude commatoken asking us two of us bagging to pack our 250 bags more quickly periodtoken  i spoke with management about this as it was not our fault that we have to bag our own groceries to save a few bucks periodtoken  as ive recommended several people there as being a bright and happy service agents just as much as ill complain about bad service periodtoken","1434":"i was so excited when this place opened a few years back periodtoken  for some reason commatoken it took me forever to get there to try their stuff periodtoken  all and all commatoken its ok periodtoken  the bagels are not great  do yourself a favor and go the bagel factory about a mile down the road periodtoken  they have authentic ny style bagels this place does not periodtoken  the doughnuts are good  not great periodtoken  somewhere between dunkin donuts and a true bakery type of taste periodtoken  if you are going to partake commatoken go with the maple bacon bar periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenits the best on the menu periodtoken  bottom line from me commatoken no on bagels periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmeh on doughnuts periodtoken  ill probably be back commatoken but would not seek it out periodtoken","1437":"similar to below reviews i was not impressed at all after getting super excited about a new local bbq spot periodtoken you just simply cant call something pulled pork and then throw tough chewy cubes of tasteless meat onto a roll periodtoken i had to throw it away it was that bad periodtoken the redeeming quality the sides really nicely done fresh cut fries and mac but come on dukes  step up your game man as i want to see a local spot do well","1445":"this place is sub par at best periodtoken ive had better pancakes at my local diner periodtoken i ordered the blueberry pancakes thinking they would be these fluffy pancakes oozing of warm delicious blueberries periodtoken well commatoken they were about silver dollar size and had like 3 blueberries per pancake i kid you not dont get duped like we did periodtoken go somewhere else not even close to worth the wait periodtoken","1450":"so billingsgate used to be a sit down meal experience periodtoken  it was a place where i could take out of town visitors for some really good commatoken fresh fish periodtoken    i was a little disappointed to find out that you go up to the till commatoken place your order and pay for your meal before you sit at your table periodtoken  so here is another situation where if you dont have cash on you commatoken you are expected to tip before you have even had your meal periodtoken    the one server that they had on staff that night was very rushed and i felt rather bad for her periodtoken  we patiently awaited our turn to order periodtoken    you have a full view of the kitchen so that you can watch your food being prepared if you wish periodtoken  it looked like the cook took pride in what he was doing periodtoken    there were two of us periodtoken  we ordered a batch of steamed mussels commatoken the deep fried oysters and the seafood platter periodtoken  the oysters and the sampler are deep fried periodtoken    your meals are at least brought out to your table periodtoken  the steamed mussels were served in a red sauce commatoken which i am going to guess had a tomato paste base to it periodtoken  the mussels were tender and the sauce was okay but it was nothing spectacular periodtoken  as you can see from the photo i posted commatoken you are given a tiny sliver of bread and a single butter pat periodtoken  dadeos are much tastier periodtoken    the deep fried oysters were really dark commatoken they looked burnt periodtoken  they were juicy though and served with french fries and an inhouse made seafood sauce periodtoken   the seafood platter was again commatoken deep fried periodtoken  it contained 2 shrimp commatoken 2 scallops commatoken 1 oyster commatoken 1 cod  fries periodtoken  this was also served with an inhouse made seafood sauce and no tartar sauce in sight  white and malt vinegar is supplied on the tables periodtoken  the cod was overcooked to the point of being mushy and falling apart periodtoken  the rest of it was edible commatoken but really plain periodtoken    billingsgate commatoken you really need to bring the menu ordering back again  it would have been nice to have more that one beer with my meal and it also would have been nice to have a server to ask for water and tartar sauce periodtoken    i do need to note that the retail side of billingsgate is quite nice periodtoken  the fish and seafood is all on ice in the coolers commatoken or you have several frozen choices as well periodtoken  there is live lobster and crab in the tanks ready to take home periodtoken  they have a wonderful selection of purity products from the east coast commatoken and everything that you would need to make a great newfie jiggs dinner on a sunday periodtoken","1488":"i want to know what happened to this place periodtoken a year ago i would have given it 5 stars but now i cant periodtoken the biggest difference is their chicken breasts periodtoken i bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them periodtoken its almost as if they cut the center out and theres only a little meat on both edges and a whole lot of breaded bone periodtoken it was ridiculous of course like an idiot i thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week periodtoken same thing periodtoken the other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty periodtoken i dont know whats going on but i would advise you not to buy the breasts even if youre a fan of white meat periodtoken theyre the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all periodtoken otherwise the service is ok and when you call ahead its ready for pickup about 75 of the time periodtoken","1515":"pretty decent ice cream but lackluster food periodtoken  got a tuna sandwich here online for pickup commatoken and when i get there commatoken they told me that they forgot to tell me that they dont have tuna in the restaurant tonight and can cook me something else periodtoken  so i was forced to choose another item on the menu of comparable price for them to cook periodtoken  i ended up with a grilled cheese which is teeny tiny and dry periodtoken    come here for ice cream commatoken but this place is definitely not more than just ice cream periodtoken  all it really offers is ice cream periodtoken","1540":"not pet friendly which is quite odd since its a farm commatoken although no signs state such a thing periodtoken periodtoken everyone was friendly except for one old bat cashier periodtoken i assume she was some type of manager making sure nobody was going to leave with a smile on their face periodtoken periodtoken","1555":"food was nothing special periodtoken i think this place gets a lot of hype because they

trying to get to the bar periodtoken the bartenders were so rude commatoken too the over21 lounge upstairs looked nice periodtoken but commatoken again commatoken good luck trying to see anything

wasnt impressed that the entrance was in an alley periodtoken but commatoken the will call lady was really nice periodtoken i really enjoy the more intimate venues commatoken but this place was not for me periodtoken","1602":"have been about 6 times and felt a decline in the service and food each time periodtoken the beer will always be quirky and tasty but the food periodtoken periodtoken

food commatoken my partner ordered the scramble and said it lacked flavor periodtoken however commatoken the cinnamon swirl french toast i ordered was delicious periodtoken","1713":"food was nothing

breakfast salad that was supposed to have some roasted potatoes on it periodtoken they were cold and rock hard commatoken felt like theyd been frozen and taken straight from the freezer periodtoken it was supposed to have 2 poached eggs on the salad commatoken but ended up with only 1 yolk and some extra bits of white periodtoken my boyfriends meal was forgotten and then when he asked about it and they eventually prepared it commatoken what i think was supposed to be a warm sandwich contained cold buffalo chicken that seemed it shouldve been heated periodtoken sadly wont be returning","1764":"there are some days when you are so desperate for a cup of coffee that you will pay a fortune periodtoken so imagine my surprise on one of these days when the total for a cup of large coffee landed me less than three bucks in commatoken of all places commatoken clayton periodtoken i had heard some mixed reviews about this small chain and i decided to give it a go since i was in the area periodtoken i honestly have tasted better commatoken and the buzz i got didnt last very long for a large periodtoken and on top of that commatoken i didnt get the best service during the 2

better periodtoken next time i will periodtoken","1849":"super slow service commatoken salads are not very good and really over priced periodtoken wont be returning periodtoken","1851":"food was good commatoken but overpriced periodtoken  sandwiches came with stale chips periodtoken  although we didnt try any commatoken the beers may be good commatoken but a glass of the house chardonnay which was sweet and simple was 8 periodtoken  likewise commatoken mixed drinks were 9 for a small drink periodtoken  our tab for 2 was 85 with tip and included 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks apiece periodtoken  nice atmosphere commatoken but wont be a place we visit often commatoken if we do indeed return periodtoken","1903":"the food was great periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhowever the wait staff was so bad it was incredible periodtoken  he not only insulted us as we complained about our 2 hour wait for our entrees commatoken but insisted we werent there that long and that we were just hangry periodtoken  he said its okay youre mad i understand youre hangry periodtoken  never did a manager come to talk to us commatoken even after a guest in our party went to talk to the chefs periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey were dumbfounded periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbecause we realized the kitchen never had our order one bad server shouldnt describe a restaurant commatoken however the manager

least efficient subway i have ever experienced periodtoken  im not sure if the employees dogs had all just died commatoken or what the deal was commatoken but they barely said hi and barely made eye contact periodtoken    i have been to many great subways in my day periodtoken  this is certainly not one of them periodtoken  they get two stars only because my sandwich was good periodtoken  but when there is a subway on nearly every street around vandy commatoken you better believe i wont be coming back to this one periodtoken","1916":"wholes food have a good variety of organic food periodtoken they always seem to be up to date as well periodtoken i love that their seafood is always fresh and i love making fresh roasted peanut butter for my children periodtoken the only thing i

was not a very good impression periodtoken decor was really nice and we got seated very quickly by the hostess commatoken who looked to be all of 14 periodtoken our waitress arrived and thats when it went downhill periodtoken maybe she was new commatoken idk commatoken but it took her 3 trips to our table before she was ready to take our order periodtoken i asked for a beer to be brought with the meal and not beforehand and she assured me that was not a problem periodtoken i was wanting a burger but was told sides were extra commatoken so i went with catfish instead periodtoken wanted a kids meal for my grandson and was informed sides for those were extra as well periodtoken what next extra for silverware there were no crayons or colouring books for kids to keep them busy or child sized utensils either periodtoken anyways commatoken the food came quick and was tasty periodtoken portion size was very good as well periodtoken the waitress came back to check on us after about 10 minutes commatoken at which time my wife was able to inform her that the dressing for her salad commatoken which was supposed to be on the side commatoken was nonexistent periodtoken about 7 minutes later she came back with the oil and vinegar periodtoken we were able to finish our meal and then wait another 10 minutes or so for her to ask if we were ready for our check periodtoken during that time we we able to watch as one of the male staff came up to the hostess station and was able to give long commatoken lingering full body hugs to the 14yo and 4 others who had gathered at the front door periodtoken when he left commatoken the girls continued the hug fest commatoken in between customers coming in periodtoken such love amongst the staff 8 minutes later the check arrived commatoken but not before 2 other tables had to go up to hug central and ask for their server commatoken too periodtoken going over the bill commatoken at least i didnt get charged for the beer that is still in their tap overall commatoken i feel this place is overrated commatoken and itll probably be quite awhile before i go there again periodtoken by the way commatoken if youve happened to live a long life or have served our county commatoken they dont care periodtoken neither senior not military discounts are offered periodtoken bottom line food was a hit commatoken service was h","1925":"its okay periodtoken if you do not have a car and need some photos after a crazy night i guess this would be the best spot available in isla vista periodtoken  the broth needs depth commatoken there is some flavor commatoken but you need to add tons of spices and other sauces to make it worth while periodtoken","1940":"waitresses are great but kitchen staff needs to pay better attention to orders  commatoken my food allergy could have caused me issues and i know waitress noted my order down correctly periodtoken  plus they didnt get orders correct at neighboring tables as well periodtoken","1947":"just personal preference i guess but there was too much sauce so it was all goopy and too overpowering of a flavour periodtoken  periodtoken","1986":"and for my third visit periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i ordered a dirty chai latte commatoken which took almost 10 minutes to create despite being the only customer in there commatoken and it was topped with fresh grated nutmeg commatoken which gave it an astringent flavor which was so hard to choke down that i threw the cup away commatoken barely a third of the way down periodtoken big waste of money periodtoken   note ive had a dirty chai here once before commatoken without the nutmeg and with a different barista creating it commatoken and it was truly one of the best id had periodtoken  the short of it make sure they dont put nutmeg on it commatoken because it does not taste as good periodtoken","1992":"this location has always had good food and service in the past but my last 3 purchases have been awful periodtoken  i used the drivethru about once a week but no more periodtoken  food has been cold periodtoken the beef was colder than the lettuce  they have left out napkins

periodtoken  hate to see this location fall apart periodtoken  i wont be back periodtoken","2023":"smells like something burnt in here periodtoken full montegu sandwich was good commatoken but i am used to bigger sandwich at this price periodtoken  nothing to really impress me here periodtoken  i wont want to come back any time soon voluntarily periodtoken however commatoken ive been told the thanksgiving sandwich is memorable periodtoken","2030":"food was ok periodtoken seemed to lack flavor periodtoken potato salad was blah periodtoken they forgot to use our free appetizer yelp coupon periodtoken but since husband checked us out i shouldnt complain periodtoken but it was a slow sunday so not sure why periodtoken  lots of other options on the river front to try periodtoken  so in general not great but not horrible periodtoken","2035":"i was in the neighborhood so i thought id stop buy to pick up some pork butt and some pork fat for making some sausage periodtoken  they actually argued with me and wouldnt go to the back to grab me the fat periodtoken  they had no idea that i was not making pork sausage but just using it as a filler meat to get up to the correct weight for the recipe periodtoken i should have known the quality of the business when i walked in and all of the refrigerated displays were empty and the only other customer in there was only picking up jugs of water lol periodtoken","2056":"prices are higher than other close by stores periodtoken  we decided to stop in and purchase an advertised street sign advertisement beer on a whim periodtoken  this would have been a good purchase but they didnt have it in stock periodtoken  call it false advertising commatoken bait and switch commatoken or poor inventory planning as i stopped in a couple of days later and still no sale item periodtoken  this is not my first choice commatoken rarely stop in due to the repeated nature of my concerns periodtoken  i assume they are less competitive due to their small footprint commatoken so while i can accept higher prices as a result commatoken the store should yank its advertising if it cant fill orders periodtoken","2067":"the food i ordered was decent but the wait time for my familys order was ridiculous we waited almost 1 hour after placing the order for 2 orders of fish tacos commatoken a childs fried fish and a burger periodtoken it was 200 in the afternoon periodtoken","2070":"thouroughly disappointed by this one i litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices periodtoken   my stops included samosa deb 10 for curry chicken with rice and samosa  horrible rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable periodtoken it was mush periodtoken there was no curry periodtoken it taste more like a bland indian dish which i have never had periodtoken the spices were there but there was no salt periodtoken the dosa was mushy periodtoken it was disgusting   next stop ktown korean fried chicken 8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked korean style periodtoken save your time and your money and go straight to cafe soho the wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken periodtoken what a let down periodtoken   then on to the cow and the curd 14 for glorifried cheese and a frozen lemonade periodtoken it was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick periodtoken sadly enough this is what i enjoyed the most periodtoken what left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck i was with friends from atlanta who came to philly for the night market so i wanted to share periodtoken i asked the owner for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply no commatoken we have no extra dishes periodtoken try using a napkin periodtoken as i looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers periodtoken wow commatoken way to loose a customer buddy periodtoken   now on to relish 8 for chicken in waffles commatoken yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles commatoken add a pat of maple syrup butter on top commatoken yum yum periodtoken sounds amazing right yeah thats what i was thinking until i bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the disgusting taste of dark meat chicken periodtoken my entire body quivered as i spit the waffle in to a napkin  come on relish commatoken you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenin the trash it went periodtoken  i will not be returning to this night market i saw the reviews but i really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt periodtoken we were so disappointed we ended up driving to jims steaks in west philly to satisfy our food cravings periodtoken i will give the one in chinatown a try in the fall periodtoken my suggestions to my foodies commatoken avoid this one periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","2073":"just finshed lunch buffet at this restaurant periodtoken most of the trays are empty  and no one bothers to fill them periodtoken periodtokenpathetic service periodtoken periodtokenpathetic food nothing is fresh everything is re heated and that is so clearly understood  periodtoken","2083":"the food definitely did not live up to my expectations the service was good despite the long wait and huge crowd commatoken but the food itself was subpar periodtoken i ate the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a crab sandwich periodtoken the bisque was too tomatoey and i didnt even see and lobster chunks in it commatoken and the bread bowl was not fresh periodtoken the crab sandwich was decent commatoken but flavorless commatoken you could hardly tell that it was crab periodtoken my mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious commatoken though ridiculously overpriced at 20 periodtoken the clam chowder was thick and buttery commatoken and the bread bowl was once again stale periodtoken overall commatoken a very disappointing meal that was insanely overpriced periodtoken such a bummer periodtoken","2109":"because of this panera breads proximity to king of prussia commatoken costco commatoken and the movie theater commatoken ive been here at least 4 times periodtoken each time commatoken some different person manages to get my order wrong periodtoken   dont get me wrong commatoken i love panera bread commatoken but the service that this location provides is horrible the first time i ordered a panini and i stood there for at least 15 minutes before i went up and asked about my order periodtoken it turns out commatoken it never went through although the charge on my credit card certainly did the mistakes made in the secondthird orders were also relatively small but irritating to fix periodtoken how hard is it to take an order for a salad or a sandwich usually the place is pretty empty too   i think the 4th time is the last straw periodtoken they messed up the salad that i ordered i asked them to omit some ingredients because of allergy restrictions and when i checked the receipt commatoken saw they charged me for extra  so i got back in line holding my salad like a huge idiot commatoken and after a 20minute wait even though there were only 2 customers ahead of me commatoken it took 5 different people another 20minutes to solve the issue periodtoken in total i probably spent about 45minutes just waiting to get the right food periodtoken they refunded me the extras charge commatoken but not the cost of the total bill about 8 periodtoken im trying not to gripe about 8 bucks commatoken but a 45minute wait is kind of ridiculous periodtoken  passing on this panera forever  hopefully other paneras in this area will be better periodtoken","2166":"ordered the full slab for 26 expecting the meal to feed at least four people periodtoken  although the meat was plentiful commatoken it comes dry with a small container of bbq sauce periodtoken  you run out of sauce about a quarter of the way through even if you are being stingy with it periodtoken also comes with beans and toast but only enough for one person periodtoken  wont be coming back periodtoken  we have way better bbq here in tucson and much closer too periodtoken","2206":"ru sans is interesting periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken to say the least my wife and i are regular sushi eaters commatoken and we always somehow end up back at ru sans i am beginning to think its because it is close to where we live periodtoken  positives the menu is extremely creative and gargantuan i love that they have some cheaper options commatoken and plenty of variety periodtoken  negatives ru sans has the worst service i have ever had periodtoken on a typical dinner night out with my wife even on odd weekdays commatoken it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there periodtoken the waiters seem to either disappear commatoken or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected periodtoken on many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server periodtoken  the food is good commatoken but seems to take a longer time to come out than usual places periodtoken they have recently raised their prices a little commatoken so be prepared to eat 50 worth of sushi","2216":"im sad to report that taste of havana left me a little disappointed periodtoken when i heard that a new cuban place had opened in indianapolis commatoken i was so excited that i had my wife take me there straight from the airport periodtoken funny enough commatoken she was picking me up after my trip to miami commatoken so cuban food was already on my mind periodtoken  the fricase de pollo chicken fricassee was just okay periodtoken it wasnt particularly flavorful commatoken and the bed of rice it came on was soggy periodtoken   we also ordered a beef pastelito commatoken but got chicken periodtoken and while thats obviously not a terrible mistake commatoken the pastelito itself was pretty bad periodtoken much too sweet commatoken and not in a good way periodtoken it was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago commatoken and that have just been sitting around since then periodtoken   the cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch commatoken but ultimately commatoken this also left us pining for miami periodtoken the foamy top was exceptional commatoken and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out periodtoken but it just didnt have the richness that we were expecting periodtoken   it should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable periodtoken we particularly liked the crocodilethemed wall painting over the front door periodtoken   underwhelming on a number of levels commatoken and nowhere equal to the hype periodtoken   the cuban place on moller and 38th is far superior periodtoken","2241":"the food is good sometimes and sometimes subpar periodtoken i do love the chocolate chip cookies everything is overpriced for the quality periodtoken also commatoken they say they are open until 4 commatoken but when i went to grab a late lunch to go was informed that they close the kitchen at 2 periodtoken i didnt see this info anywhere online so ended up leaving upset with no food periodtoken also commatoken others have mentioned the lack of a bathroom periodtoken this is a serious issue periodtoken i was told to go to the library which i found out was closed periodtoken after i friggin walked there periodtoken so commatoken although ive gotten some good sandwiches and cookies commatoken it just isnt worth the hassle or unreliability in quality to come here again periodtoken","2250":"its been a long long time since i have eaten  the pancake pantry commatoken so with friends driving through we decided to meet them there periodtoken we arrived  about 1000 am commatoken and the line was down 21st avenue about 100 feet periodtoken we waited for about an hour to get inside periodtoken if you go to pancake pantry commatoken expect it periodtoken when we got through and left about 1230 pm commatoken the line was still about 50  75 feet down 21st avenue periodtoken  quite frankly commatoken im not sure why local people  others crave pancake pantry periodtoken the food is ok commatoken its a decent breakfast commatoken but its also over priced for the quality and quantity periodtoken ive had better  more pancakes commatoken eggs commatoken and meat commatoken etc periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken at cracker barrel and other restaurants periodtoken dont get me wrong commatoken i enjoyed the breakfast periodtoken but commatoken the quality and quantity is definitely not up to the hype periodtoken the sentiment for the other 3 people was about the same periodtoken  the service we received was exceptional periodtoken the waitress was on the ball commatoken serving us coffee when we needed it commatoken got our orders properly right commatoken and kept making sure we were being treated properly periodtoken  the total bill including tax and tip was 62 periodtoken00 for 4 people periodtoken","2256":"everything is great except the ac kicks at 10am to where it makes it too cold to hang out periodtoken it has been this way for months and im not sure why they dont change it periodtoken i would rate 5 stars if the ac functioned properly periodtoken please fix it periodtoken","2272":"this place has wonderful ambiance and is spacious for group dining periodtoken the food and service however are terrible periodtoken everyone had something that tasted funky or didnt come right periodtoken with the kitchen upstairs and our table downstairs every problem took twice as long to work out as well periodtoken it is way overpriced periodtoken i dont recommend it and wont go back periodtoken","2314":"ive been going to this place since it was just the casino as i was not of age for the glory days of seminole bingo periodtoken the hrc has had good moments and its had bad moments periodtoken yes commatoken it is often very smoky if this bothers you you may not enjoy the odor periodtoken the drinks are expensive but thats to be understood given that they arent your local podunk dive periodtoken the casino has always been relatively clean when ive gone periodtoken for anyone complaining that the machines must be rigged because they arent paying out commatoken the reason that they are there is to take money from you and give it to themselves payout is not guaranteed and you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose periodtoken  as to the service commatoken my reactions have taken a steady downward turn since opening periodtoken my first time there my date and i enjoyed dinner at floyds and were served by a young man named kurt so good i remember his name all these years later and were happy with the food and elated with his service periodtoken on other occasions i would go either alone or with coworkers periodtoken as my coworkers and i got out of work late the casino was a place we could go to eat commatoken drink commatoken and make merry periodtoken when we would arrive during late hours and eat at the open restaurants we were treated poorly by people that acted as though they did not want to be there and the food served was substandard periodtoken i am not a particularly picky eater but a slab of bendyourfork frozen pie or green beans that hold a similar temperature to refrigerator from whence they probably came shouldnt be what i expect from a place that charges what the hrc does periodtoken if the restaurants dont want people to come in late they shouldnt be open commatoken and if the employees dont want to work late hours they should find other employment periodtoken as for the casino employees on the floor i have a generally neutral impression as i dont bug them and they dont bug me but one particular instance stands out periodtoken on a brief jaunt through the slot machines on my way to dinner at the casino i won a hair over 10 periodtoken i kept the slip and cashed out on my way out and the lady working the cashiers desk asked if i was serious about wanting this paltry sum periodtoken surely if that is the attitude of the casino they wouldnt mind if i lost 10 and just took my money back because they have far more than i do and shouldnt mind me keeping that periodtoken i dont care if i won a nickel or thousand dollars the only thing people working the cage should say about your winnings is commatoken congratulations periodtoken  as to the new parking fee commatoken im not looking to get the same canned response from their rep that everyone else has been getting periodtoken hrc can say anything they like about security or bringing themselves in line with other hotels ive never had a security problem there and a business should be going out of the way to make themselves different from others periodtoken anybody with a lick of sense can see that the reason for implementing the parking charge is as a way to keep the rabble out of the casino periodtoken as ive said i tend to go at night due to keeping late hours and brother commatoken some of the folks that come late at night are skeevy as all get out periodtoken these folks come in already drunk commatoken annoy other patrons commatoken and spend nearly no money periodtoken the casino also makes no money off frugal folks that come in and take up seats while making the smallest bets possible and pinch pennies so hard that abe lincoln filed a restraining order periodtoken implementing the parking fee is a way to keep the cheap or disruptive people out while not deterring the relatively small percentage of patrons that spend a lot and make up the majority of their profit periodtoken my main concern with using this tactic to keep out undesirables is that eventually the groups will realize that they can save the money by packing folks in to a minivan and splitting the cost between six or eight of them commatoken only to have another pack of drunks or misers do the same and rather than ten individuals taking up ten parking spots and ten places at the casino youre have sixty or more individuals taking up ten parking spots and sixty or more places at the casino periodtoken  my rating on the facility is not incumbent upon the parking fee and reflects only the quality of goods and services provided periodtoken a place that prides itself on being different should be different in the right ways and as it is this facility is in dire need of a uturn periodtoken","2319":"i put off trying p  k because of the 12 price tag on the burger commatoken even though its been recommended periodtoken  yesterday i decided id try it out for drinks periodtoken  the mark up is almost as bad for drinks periodtoken  however the real turn off was the service periodtoken  the hostesses and waitresses were all aloof and unengaged periodtoken  hypothesis 1 management sought to hire snooty staff periodtoken  hypothesis 2 they are made to dress them in quite constraining clothes and they can hardly breathe enough to talk to customers periodtoken  who knows","2321":"i got a concrete that was supposed to have reeses and banana periodtoken when i got it commatoken it was melted and disgusting with literally 2 small pieces of reeses and maybe 15 of a banana periodtoken had a minty taste too which is not what i expected haha periodtoken disappointing for my first time at this place periodtoken wont be going back","2323":"i want to like this place since its right around the corner from me commatoken but its just less than mediocre sushi and way overpriced periodtoken the rolls are undersized and the fish is not very fresh periodtoken good location commatoken bad sushi commatoken worse prices periodtoken","2333":"i saw big data when they came to town at the knitting factory periodtoken some things  the area is really skeazy periodtoken i am happy reno is trying to change the image of the city commatoken but that cannot be accomplished over night and this place is super creepy periodtoken  the sound quality is horrible periodtoken if you want to really hear the band you paid to see commatoken go somewhere else periodtoken the building is not shaped right for a concert venue and because of it commatoken the sound will sooner bust out your eardrums periodtoken","2348":"i was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if i was sure i wanted to order periodtoken so ill take my business elsewhere periodtoken but i hear the food is really good periodtoken","2349":"one might want to skip the coffees made in their machine periodtoken i had a cappuccino made twice and both times there were grounds in the bottom periodtoken i returned them  i was told they are getting a new machine periodtoken","2355":"very slow service for a very simple order periodtoken food quality was average compared to other kfcs periodtoken","2379":"i really wanted to like this coffee but obviously i didnt periodtoken  the location was nice and had a parking lot which is important because parking in the trendiest area of santa barbara is a b periodtoken  the vibe was typical coffee shop d\u00e9cor and the service was good periodtoken  i just couldnt get over the finish or aftertaste of the coffee periodtoken","2392":"it seriously pains me to be writing this update periodtoken i loved this giant periodtoken like commatoken in an emotional way periodtoken and i still love that its clean and has a lot of variety and great sale prices commatoken so on and so forth and what have you periodtoken however commatoken im sorry to say that i can no longer frequent this store due to its poor customer service periodtoken i dont know if they got a new manager or what commatoken but in the past few months things there have gone seriously downhill periodtoken   there are rarely people available to bag groceries commatoken which in turn slows checkout lines while the cashier and customer both try to do it periodtoken more than once ive gotten in a line with a bagger only to have that person walk away after finishing up with a customer periodtoken   in this same time period they have also gotten into the habit of stocking shelves during high traffic times  like sundays at 11 periodtoken i get that items need to be on shelves commatoken but ive seen them rearranging shelves during this time too  not necessary periodtoken it doesnt appear that theyre just filling up on out of stock items  there are big carts and empty boxes in nearly every aisle at times periodtoken it causes so much traffic in the aisles and too many times you cant reach what you need periodtoken   my biggest complaint is about the deli commatoken though periodtoken one of my favorite things about this store is the ability to order your deli items from a kiosk commatoken do all of your shopping commatoken and then whip around and pick up your items  no need to grab a number and wait periodtoken this kiosk allows you to specify how you want your items sliced periodtoken i always choose very thin commatoken and i used to get it periodtoken for several months now commatoken however commatoken my meat has been cut so thick that even my carnivore husband is grossed out by it periodtoken yesterday i had enough and just left it there commatoken going then to a different store for those items periodtoken   i wish this store had maintained the high quality experience it had in the beginning commatoken but unfortunately it hasnt and as a result commatoken its former biggest fan will be shopping elsewhere periodtoken","2403":"okay commatoken yes commatoken i know its a brewery commatoken but the smell of hops was so strong and overwhelming the night we ate there commatoken we were unable to enjoy our meal periodtoken my husband spent the whole time notsosubtly with his shirt over his nose commatoken and my kids kept begging to leave periodtoken i thought the tacos were decent commatoken but we couldnt get past the smell periodtoken","2415":"nashville is challenged when it comes to italian food in my opinion periodtoken this restaurant is no exception periodtoken disclaimer i lived near several great italian places in nyc so i am spoiled periodtoken that said commatoken la tavola is still below what i feel should be an average experience periodtoken   if you have high standards for italian food commatoken you will likely be disappointed periodtoken the recipes arent traditional the marsala so many people rave about is a creamy sauce commatoken for example commatoken rather than a nice commatoken light marsala wine based sauce periodtoken if you are looking for something a little better than pizza hut commatoken you will be happy periodtoken","2424":"if you want to have some shake late in night go for it periodtoken i wont recommend it for other food menu if there are other options around place periodtoken we ordered meal deal but the server didnt get it complete thinking of saving money by not getting soda  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokentwo of my friends got cold burger and fries and instead of making fresh new ones commatoken they just warmed it up in the small oven periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenah this is what you get from such places periodtoken luckily my burger and fries were hot so i  wasnt as mad as them  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenveggie options are ok periodtoken again go only if there is no other option  periodtoken periodtokenthere are many other places around periodtoken periodtoken","2434":"maybe i ordered wrong commatoken but after my first visit i cant say this will be in my rotation when im craving a trendy acai bowl periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i stopped in and they werent too busy four people in line ahead of me and it still took me about 20 minutes to order and get my bowl which seemed like a long time periodtoken the menu was interesting since they offer other kinds of fruit bowls in addition to the traditional acai bows and smoothies periodtoken i decided to be creative and ordered the kale bowl which was blended with fruit and came with granola and honey on top periodtoken my bf ordered smarter and got the beach bowl which is one of their best sellers and added peanut butter for an extra charge periodtoken note that the toppings cost extra here which explains why the bowls are more affordable at 7 periodtoken95 each periodtoken i have to stay periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken my kale bowl was watery and lacked flavor periodtoken i also didnt love the granola they used periodtoken i wondered if my error came from ordering kale commatoken but i tasted my bfs best seller and it definitely wasnt up to par with juice nashville or franklin juice company periodtoken both were quite bland and seemed to be more ice than fruit periodtoken  i was starving and it was a good sized bowl commatoken especially for the price commatoken but i have to say that it left much to be desired periodtoken ill probably give them a few months before giving them a second chance periodtoken","2435":"the food was good commatoken thats the only reason they got 2 stars the hostess was less then enthusiastic and barley greeted us when we were being seated periodtoken the waitress only checked on us once after serving our food periodtoken the hostess came around with water and saw my husbands glass was empty but he had sprite periodtoken rather than getting one for him or informing the waitress we waited for another 10 minutes and flagged the waitress down for the bill periodtoken also some attention needed to be given to cleaning periodtoken all the doors were covered in handprints commatoken the floors had swirl marks from mopping with a less than clean mop and the light fixtures and air vents were dusty periodtoken we arent from the area and had to decide between barbecue and the chinese place in the plaza periodtoken should have gone with chinese","2467":"mediocre food commatoken decent service periodtoken  excellent fountain coke periodtoken  my advice if you have to eat here commatoken use the salsa which was way too sweet to add some flavor to the rest of your meal periodtoken  i was amazed by how many restaurants are in this shopping center periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the fact that estelas is still in business is bad commentary on the rest of them","2493":"food was good periodtoken i had the buffalo chicken soups commatoken kids loved the grilled cheese and the bread it came on  service was not good  never offered refills although glasses were empty a long time periodtoken  i had to take our glasses over to the bar on the other side for a refill periodtoken  we asked for ketchup several times commatoken i went and asked another table to borrow theirs so the kids could eat their fries periodtoken  the lady who brought our food did not say a word just dropped the food on the table and turned around periodtoken  took forever to get the check after asking twice periodtoken  the one waitress we saw on the way out said

time and likely last visit periodtoken french onion soup was poorlyflavored onion water with an abundance of cheese and crouton periodtoken special chickenprosciutto creamy pasta was underseasoned but thank you for the salt and fresh pepper grinder at the table so i can season my own food periodtoken its not like i just added a sprinkling of pepper to enhance periodtoken there was absolutely no taste periodtoken what i consider an abundance of salt was added  unacceptable for a 17 periodtoken50 plate of pasta periodtoken chocolate mousse was welltextured commatoken chocolatey commatoken but could have been richer periodtoken too sugary sweet periodtoken    i will likely never experience this place for a fourth trip periodtoken its just not good enough commatoken and who wants to go to a restaurant thats a crap shoot","2522":"check your bill  the service was just ok and so was the food periodtoken  the big issue i had is when the check was delivered there was an aca surcharge     in case you were wondering what this is commatoken as i did commatoken its a surcharge the restaurant is sneaking onto the check to cover their expenses for the affordable care act commatoken i periodtokene periodtoken commatoken obamacare  sorry commatoken but i pay almost 400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and i dont want to pay for others periodtoken    i did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes  the manager did come to the table and told us the servers are required to tell us upon seating about the surcharge and that its posted on their menus periodtoken  we were not warned ahead of time and when i asked to see the menu the manager just said hed take it off the check periodtoken    we will not be returning periodtoken  the only reason i am giving two stars is the server seemed like a good person and when the food is done right it can be tasty commatoken but there never seems to be any consistency to either periodtoken","2546":"wife and i tried this joint for the first time on a sat eve take out commatokenas its 5 min from our home periodtokenwe are always trying new places and love that we had a new

food establishments   we each ordered a bento commatoken mine with tempura and dumplings his with tempura and sushi periodtoken they both came out looking quite appetizing and very generous

i gave them to the bf to finish commatoken the bento came with 3 and i only ate one periodtoken the small salad of carrot and bean sprouts were probably the best thing in the box periodtoken actually no commatoken the tempura yam was it was light and not overly greasy commatoken but still nothing to write home about periodtoken as for the fruit periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken well periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it was canned and all tasted the same commatoken syrupy and canny if thats even a word    service was average and price was not equal to value periodtoken sadly commatoken i

the most commatoken starbucks the expensive choice commatoken maybe 2 commatoken but nowhere in the valley will charge you above 3 for three shots of espresso periodtoken just for the economy of it all commatoken id recommend going anywhere else periodtoken not sure about the other drinks but my guess is if the pricing is scaled a fancy latte or two would run you a paycheck periodtoken if you

does not match the price i swear every order of fries gets smaller and smaller periodtoken with the hundreds of other places commatoken dozens of them within blocks of here commatoken to get an equally commatoken or arguably better commatoken burger for less commatoken faster commatoken and with better service commatoken the only reason to eat here is if you have no other options periodtoken","2917":"friendly service periodtoken  ice cream was very good commatoken but overpriced or way too skimpy in terms of portion sizes periodtoken  i would not return or recommend it others

especially when youre waiting for several hours for your flight  it unfortunately took me a looooooong time to get that cup of sugary goodness periodtoken despite the name commatoken copelands cheesecake scoops doesnt just offer dessert  and there were some serious problems in their kitchen when i stopped by periodtoken i distinctly heard the staffers complaining that someone had just

give this particular business another chance periodtoken the staffers were clearly not communicating amongst themselves commatoken let alone with the guests and no effort was made to keep us posted on

inconsistent periodtoken","2992":"got around to checking this place out last weekend periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i agree with one persons comment about its nothing like satco  thank god  im not sure why another person said it was periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  and another thing commatoken the college kidsfrat boys have found it commatoken but hopefully they wont make it one of their new hang outs commatoken as i didnt see buckets of beer on the menu periodtoken   so the line issue will hopefully figure itself out because i dont think its a great idea periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  it takes people forever to order so the line doesnt move very quickly though maybe thats just how it was the night i was there commatoken and since its a new place people are unfamiliar with the menu and take longer but if there are open seats at the bar commatoken id run over there and grab them and you dont have to wait in line  you can place your order at the bar periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken although then you have to eat indoors periodtoken   the staff seemed very friendly and eager to serve commatoken which was a good thing periodtoken the menu was small and simple periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken which is also nice sometimes periodtoken  too many options can make choosing difficult  they have about 8 different soft tacos and i think also about 6 different enchiladas periodtoken periodtoken  all the tacos are 2 periodtoken50 periodtoken  they also serve up some sides like salsas commatoken queso commatoken and guac  all for a good price of less than 4 periodtoken  i think they also had some other items but since i was there for tacos commatoken i didnt really read them periodtoken  the southern fried taco wasnt too exciting  just some fried chicken and a sweet sauce in a taco  so id pass on that one periodtoken  the korean bbq one i thought was really tasty  great flavor to it  my boyfriend had the fish taco  he said it was good commatoken but not great  and he also had the spicy shrimp taco which he said was excellent periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and now wants to keep going back just for that taco  apparently its super super spicy so beware i liked the queso commatoken i didnt think it resembled gross melted down cheese like someone else mentioned periodtoken  it was creamy and tasty periodtoken  served its purpose they also had an interesting drink menu  im gonna try the lojito next time i go  which was basically a mojito that uses a local rum in it periodtoken   so all in all  i thought it was a great place  its super affordable commatoken it can be quick if your timing is right commatoken and they had some really interesting fun flavors instead of your standard boring tacos periodtoken  i mean kelly p if you want boring standard tacos  then go to satco commatoken or las palmas or whatever mexican restaurant youre used to going to  this place is for interesting flavors commatoken proper portion sizes commatoken good prices and quality food periodtoken    oh and they valet park  which i hate using commatoken but its convenient when theres no parking spaces   update   so i went back to local taco last weekend and decided to remove a star from my review periodtoken  first of all  the music they were playing was very loud periodtoken  now  loud music doesnt necessarily upset

maroon 5  what and not just a song  but the whole album periodtoken  i hate that band  so it totally ruined my whole experience in there periodtoken  why on earth would you play an entire album at a restaurant  there is a reason for the radio or mixes periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so your music can appeal to the masses periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken not single them out periodtoken  jesus periodtoken  it was terrible ok so on top of the awful loud music  there were flies buzzing around us the whole time and we were eating inside due to the intense heat outside periodtoken periodtoken  they were swarming our table periodtoken  very unpleasant experience periodtoken to top it off  about 2 hours later commatoken both of us were experiencing sour stomachs periodtoken periodtoken    this really upsets me because i really really wanted to like this place commatoken but after this last visit i dont think i want to return periodtoken","2995":"this place is

periodtoken  seriously periodtoken  oh and they have no fries or chips periodtoken  really am i being too traditional in expecting this  they brought me out mashed potatoes in lieu of the coleslaw i avoid mayo based dishes in principle commatoken and the mashed were pretty good but not what i wanted with a burger periodtoken  finally to cap it off we had their sticky toffee bread pudding dessert periodtoken  it was good commatoken but whoa periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken two bites of that and you should really call it quits periodtoken  way too rich for my blood periodtoken","3032":"wow the bread was awesome but the service and food was less desirable periodtoken the bartenders were a bit more concerned about doing shots with each other than taking care of the paying periodtoken the

the workers there to be very pushy commatoken trying to hurry me through the line periodtoken   lets get down to brass tax commatoken nuts and bolts periodtoken this is a buffet without the benefits

i cannot speak on the food because we did not stay to eat periodtoken my cocktail was very good as was the bartender periodtoken i was rather appalled by the fact that after we took a seat and ordered our drinks the hostessmanager came and told us we would be charged 5 periodtoken00 each bc they had a jazz band that night periodtoken which is odd bc it was more of a restaurant than a venue periodtoken i couldnt imagine them doing that i mean a house band should be an incentive to eat there not a hinderance periodtoken seemed like a desperate attempt to make money periodtoken the decor was lackluster and minimal periodtoken a huge black wall periodtoken seemed unfinished periodtoken the bar looked under stocked commatoken ikea bought and like it belonged in a basement periodtoken

addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset periodtoken you cant see anyone periodtoken aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night periodtoken great bathrooms though commatoken very clean periodtoken  we all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out periodtoken out of 7 pies that we ordered commatoken i really only liked 1 commatoken maybe two of them and even so commatoken they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them periodtoken for the price tag of around 1214 a pie commatoken that was really disappointing periodtoken maybe the other food is better commatoken but i cannot comment on that and only through my experience periodtoken  the beer itself was good commatoken but ive had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well periodtoken most of the beers are pretty entrylevel if you are a craft beer lover commatoken so nothing exciting periodtoken  overall it was nice to try out the place commatoken i dont go to nolibs often so it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood commatoken but i dont think i will be returning for the food commatoken maybe for 12 beers if i am getting ready to go out somewhere periodtoken however if it is too crowded i will be looking elsewhere as it is not worth any wait periodtoken","3075":"had dinner here on a recent friday evening periodtoken  glad we had reservations for 5 as they were packed tight commatoken have learned this is to be expected in a new tampa restaurant periodtoken excellent and very attentive service could not make up for the soso food periodtoken    we ordered several appetizers to share  queso fundito and flautas de pollo periodtoken  queso was tasty but nearly impossible to tackle and remove to a chip once the skillet dish cooled off periodtoken  2 flautas for 8 served on a large plate commatoken fancy dressed but not impressive for taste periodtoken  i had carne asada iron skillet tacos commatoken served with mini corn tortillas which were so soft they fell apart when i tried to load them periodtoken  finally went to the beef  with a knife and fork as it was quite tough and lacked any real flavor periodtoken  the accompanying sauces were quite good periodtoken  for me commatoken the best by far was the delightful passion fruit tea  served in a tequila bottle periodtoken  besito is high on atmosphere commatoken gimmick and price periodtoken  maybe tampa will support this location past the newrestaurantfrenzy phase periodtoken  for the price commatoken there are too many other local options for me to hurry back here periodtoken","3080":"the food is pretty low quality commatoken its almost always dead and the only reason we go there is for byoing periodtoken   definitely a place to steer clear of if you are looking for real indian food periodtoken","3083":"the venue is fantastic a beautiful remodeling of a classic building in an easily accessible part of

benedict commatoken which was supposed to have chorizo sausage and i literally had maybe 5 small slices of chorizo and the rest of my dish were the eggs and vegetables periodtoken definitely not worth the money periodtoken i will give one star for the decor and one star for the manager who did stop by our table to take our drink and food orders when our waitress disappeared and did try to keep an eye on us from time to time periodtoken their servers definitely need some training as well periodtoken two of the people who brought food to our table did not know what dishes they were serving us

an okay selection commatoken despite their high prices commatoken rittenhouse market is the only place in the area where you can get some items periodtoken  for example commatoken unless you want to

is okaygood commatoken and at least its not badly priced periodtoken  considering that there are other places are easily within walking distance commatoken only of the only advantages of rittenhouse is its size periodtoken its the largest supermarket in the area commatoken and so can provide a one stop shop for food and house hold items periodtoken   that said commatoken theres a hardware store just around the corner commatoken maxxs and trader joes within walking distance commatoken and a smattering of other shops slightly further away not to mention reading terminal market commatoken which

supposed to be in a mild sauce but i found it quite spicy periodtoken my entree was the kale salad and my husband had the fish tacos periodtoken tacos were bad commatoken the fish was tough and dry as were the accompanying black beans and rice periodtoken the kale salad was a huge plate of mostly kale with barely any tomato or guacamole periodtoken it was a bit overbearing even though i enjoy kale periodtoken some manager came over to ask if we mind if they opened the huge open air window on the side of the restaurant where we were sitting and i mentioned to him about the fly problem periodtoken in fact commatoken some had gotten in my husbands wine glass the manager said it was because they had the window open earlier and comped the drinks commatoken which we appreciated

commatoken capers and onions periodtoken  no drinks as we both had water in the car periodtoken  we did decide to eat there since bagels and lox can get messy periodtoken    the bagel and lox i found to be average commatoken definitely nothing special and seemed to be heavy on the cream cheese and light on the lox periodtoken  my husband said he found the bagel and lox not to be rememberable periodtoken  the bagel itself was touted as being a new york style bagel commatoken as per the sign on the window other store info periodtoken  i really think that they meant york city commatoken pa style bagel periodtoken    what really got me though was each not both bagel and lox was 10 periodtoken75 and our total bill for just two bagels and lox with tax just shy of 23  and that did not include any drinks commatoken etc periodtoken   based on the price along i would not return commatoken but the listless bagel was pretty bad too periodtoken","3361":"very nice lady took my order

caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc periodtoken  we sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street periodtoken decent view periodtoken  we started off the meal with a pitcher of their boozy lemonade for 30 something dollars periodtoken i can guarantee there wasnt much boozy in it periodtoken tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it periodtoken  on to the food periodtoken  it took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full periodtoken  the burger meat had flavor but was dry periodtoken for 11 for the burger alone i would expect better periodtoken  the chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions periodtoken  overall a meh experience periodtoken i wont go back and wont recommend the place to anyone else periodtoken   in my opinion commatoken they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesnt live up to

the year we graduated commatoken ndulge closed its doors and relocated to the philadelphia area periodtoken upon moving to the area we were excited to come across the business and decided to take a visit periodtoken we were completely disappointed the two female staff that were present were unfriendly and had awkward attitudes which created an extremely uncomfortable environment periodtoken one of the female staff did not even address me in conversation and was only speaking to and making eye contact with my husband periodtoken  the case had a very small selection of cupcakes that didnt look appealing in terms of display or design periodtoken they were sparsely frosted with no special garnishes periodtoken we bought four different kinds and they all lacked some sort of quality component periodtoken the only thing pistachio about the chocolate moussetachio was the pistachio on top of the cupcake periodtoken the other cupcakes were extremely dry and dense and either had sparse filling

was very long periodtoken we waited for about 20 to 25 minutes periodtoken now i think this has something to do with the food place next to it the reason why i said that is because we went there first and they ran out of a main ingredient periodtoken  which means better business for panda periodtoken   as for the staff commatoken they seemed to be dreading the day periodtoken they stuck with the bare minimum of talking with customers periodtoken what can i get for you periodtoken  but then shortly after the staff started talking about personal stuff i front of customers periodtoken now if

and is almost burnt on the bottom periodtoken  in fact its burnt around the edges which leaves a charcoal taste in your mouth periodtoken  the toppings are just okay and the spicy sauce is too spicy as its all you can taste on the pizza periodtoken  this pizza has so little flavor other than the spicy sauce periodtoken  i wanted to like this new plaze as the price is so affordable but ill just get a pizza at rouses across the street periodtoken","3763":"came here with my mom all of the employees looked very young it looked like a hang out spot they were just standing around talking to each other they got my moms order wrong and charged her for something she didnt get  the chicken sandwich i ordered looked like someone smashed my bun with their hand i never go to a fast food joint looking for 5 star food but atleast make the food look decent im never eating there again  periodtoken","3765":"the building is so charming commatoken i really wanted to love this place periodtoken

on tuesdays periodtoken the first time i went it was ok service periodtoken the waiter didnt fill up my water until i pointed it out periodtoken however commatoken the second and most recent time i went commatoken i was sorely disappointed periodtoken while the sushi buffet is still a good deal commatoken it honestly isnt worth me trekking out again periodtoken the manager has since my last visit started enforcing a no sharing rule periodtoken i inquired if we could just swap one sushi out with each other since we were both getting the sushi buffet periodtoken the waiter resolutely said no periodtoken  while he and the other waitress were polite enough when bringing our food and taking our orders commatoken i could do without the slow service periodtoken we waited close to 30 minutes for our first set of rolls  and they chalked up the slowness due to needing to fry the tobiko periodtoken there were maybe at most 4 other tables besides us there periodtoken i could also overhear the waiter speaking in chinese that i was pushing and rushing for the food to be done periodtoken i mentioned it once  well past the 25 minute mark periodtoken sorry but frankly commatoken there shouldnt be a 30 minute wait for a single set of rolls periodtoken i wouldve overlooked it but it happened consistently with each set of rolls that there was a long wait periodtoken i would postulate that its a technique they use to discourage you from ordering more sushi periodtoken regardless commatoken ive had better sushi buffets in the dc area for cheaper commatoken better service commatoken and better atmosphere periodtoken in a city as large as philly commatoken im sure there are other sushi buffets to eat at periodtoken while this was my go to for take out and sushi buffets previously commatoken i can safely say i am unlikely to return or order after my last trip periodtoken other sushi buffets ive gone to dont require me to order off the menu and for me to finish each piece before getting more  and dont stipulate that i cant share among other people who have opted to get the sushi buffet too periodtoken","3769":"if youre going to eat at an izakaya joint commatoken you should be

agedashi tofu commatoken not agedashi tofu soup periodtoken  the vegetable croquettes would be better as smaller commatoken silverdollar size bites periodtoken  not pancake size periodtoken  they were out of onigiri periodtoken   periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhich is just a rice ball commatoken grilled periodtoken  so commatoken um commatoken why would a izakayasushi place be out of rice  we sat at the sushi bar and saw many rolls off to the side already premade periodtoken  we imagine many of the cooked items we ordered we premade as well periodtoken  as was probably the sold out onigiri periodtoken  i imagine the raw scallops were wrapped in bacon and kept in the fridge days ago instead of being made fresh periodtoken  the skewered scallops wrapped in bacon were fine  but anything wrapped in bacon is usually fine periodtoken  with that in mind commatoken bacon wrapped mochi is divine and i highly suggest this restaurant start serving that periodtoken  made fresh to order periodtoken  the fried squid we ordered was tasty commatoken but really greasy periodtoken  dont bother ordering the skewered quail eggs wrapped in prosciutto periodtoken  theyre nothing to write home about periodtoken  also commatoken we saw the cooks grilling chicken on a grill that had fishy mackerel grilling on it moments prior periodtoken   periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni periodtokene commatoken that chickens going to taste awfully fishy periodtoken  waitstaff needs help periodtoken  first commatoken our waitress greeted us with do you want waters or sodas  not commatoken hello periodtoken  not even commatoken may i get you something to drink  waitstaff also needs to stop entering for their shift through the front door periodtoken  it doesnt look professional periodtoken  they should arrive through the backdoor periodtoken    my suggestions for the owners  polish up your staff commatoken create a more adventurous menu takoyaki would be a nice start commatoken have later hours commatoken offer a much much larger selection of sake commatoken lay off the tired sushi items commatoken and make things fresh to order periodtoken  make it more of an izakaya sake bar with good food commatoken not some average west county sushi restaurant periodtoken  my suggestions for potential patrons  expand your pallette beyond california rolls and tempura periodtoken  also commatoken dont bother coming here until the owners change some things periodtoken  also commatoken stop calling it tapas for christsake periodtoken","3772":"im afraid that this place wont last long if management doesnt get their act together periodtoken   the show and performers were ok commatoken but pretty much everything else was a disappointment periodtoken  who runs out of jack daniels before the first show  i was surprised upon being told that we could only order food from the left side of the menu because it was the first night of the show periodtoken that meant that our only choices were 1 pork steak or 2 a hamburger with chili commatoken a fried egg and hash browns all piled on the burger and the only side item was french fries periodtoken the right side of the menu had a plethora of choices commatoken but was off limits periodtoken  the burger was warm and might have simply been a unique gastronomic experience but it was burned on both sides and dry throughout periodtoken the only part of it that i truly enjoyed was the krispy kreme donut that was used as the bun periodtoken the fries meh periodtoken  the pork steak was cold periodtoken its not that it was barely warm commatoken it was cold as though it had sat in the hallway for a while before being brought out periodtoken  the wait staff was pleasant and since we came for the show we didnt raise hell

periodtoken","3792":"just tried the newly opened wheel cafe in dunedin periodtoken let me start with the positives periodtoken i liked the setup  decor periodtoken i prefer a small menu commatoken

commatoken they were willing to do breakfast for me periodtoken the waitress was pleasant commatoken but the owner hoovered a bit too much periodtoken i opted for a burger  a bowl of their soup of the day commatoken potato leek periodtoken what i am about to say is meant for constructive purposes  not to be taken as digs periodtoken if you are going to offer up trendy food commatoken you need to be better at seasoning your dishes  food temps periodtoken the potato leek soup was bland  had no distinctive potato or leek flavor periodtoken the burger commatoken ordred medium commatoken came out more rare than medium and also lacked favor periodtoken chips on the side also lacked salt periodtoken if you want to appeal to customers who can appreciate your menu commatoken please up your salt  pepper game periodtoken and your cook temps periodtoken","3799":"this place is going down hill they serve salads and sandwiches from target and safeway  i can tell by the packaging and the sandwiches say archer farmstargets brand candy is overpriced and i doubt the chocolate is handmade periodtoken  the froyo bar looks skeevy due to the fruit that looks a little past its prime periodtoken  i do like the fact that the store is ur toppings bar for froyo periodtoken and the 5 pound gummie bears are cool to look at but it has started to become kind of gross periodtoken","3802":"great location

decent commatoken bermuda roll was also mediocre periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the napoleon sashimi was literally off tasting  may get food poisoning later tonight not kidding commatoken worried periodtoken at first the waitress was not apologetic  for the foul fish but eventually she came around with some free sake probably to help kill off deadly bacteria we just ate periodtoken table also ordered a noodle and fried rice dish and really just found the flavors to be disappointing  periodtoken thank goodness the bill was inexpensive but i will never step in here ever again periodtoken worst sushi but probably shouldnt have chose that cuisine for tennessee periodtoken periodtoken ill stick to fried chicken and cheese grits for sure periodtoken","3894":"the food was ok periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the burrito bread was hard and wasnt fresh its like a fake chipotle lol but expensive should be cheaper thou","3909":"prep and pastry is underwhelming periodtoken if you want a

go elsewhere periodtoken","3919":"the sandwiches tasted good commatoken but when trying to complete the kids meal for my 2 girls it was chaos periodtoken first when i asked for the apples and milk the girl tried to charge me extra for them commatoken then after arguing with her she directed me to the refrigerator unit to help myself periodtoken there was only one bag of apples and they were moldy periodtoken it took over 5 minutes to get 2 fresh bags periodtoken near the end of our meal my girls commatoken after drinking almost all of the milk said that it tasted funny periodtoken i looked at the expiration day and it had expired two weeks prior periodtoken i told the uninterested worker and we left periodtoken thankfully my kids didnt get sick periodtoken i wouldnt go back to that particular restaurant commatoken but i still like subway periodtoken","3920":"good service commatoken nice clean place commatoken and convenient parking periodtoken thats it on the good points

had the tomatobasil flatbread commatoken i wouldnt go back for that but ive had worse periodtoken  overall we decided that we wouldnt break our necks to get back there but if we were with people who

out of was sweet potato fries  not a big deal periodtoken   we ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great periodtoken the only critique i had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses commatoken two meats commatoken and only five small pieces of bread periodtoken we immediately asked for more bread commatoken but didnt receive it until our group had eaten 95 of the platter periodtoken  i was again disappointed in the dinner periodtoken of the 6 entrees on the menu commatoken four were seafood commatoken one was lamb commatoken and one was beef periodtoken two of us ordered the exact same thing  the 6 ounce beef filet commatoken done medium periodtoken one of us received medium commatoken while i received well done

the rest of us had been served periodtoken we were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived periodtoken i dont know if this was an issue with the kitchen commatoken or with our order not being put in correctly commatoken but i will note that our server wrote nothing down periodtoken   the only saving grace for this place is their bar commatoken with their refreshing and delicious cocktails periodtoken everyone was pleased with their selections commatoken and multiple rounds were ordered periodtoken i wish the dining experience lived up to the bar experience commatoken but i dont think we will be giving this place a third chance periodtoken","3943":"long check outs  2 cashiers each with 4 customers got in line at 504 didnt get out tim 526  managers took people from one

it work periodtoken   the beer sampler was great commatoken too periodtoken we tried a variety of stouts commatoken ales and ciders periodtoken my wife loved the double bean ale commatoken and their

carefully made homestyle cookies commatoken this is your place but dont get your hopes up periodtoken  something was very off about their alleged vietnamese ice coffee which actually made me physically ill after my first sip periodtoken  maybe i am misinformed but i also thought nutella was recently classified as a neurotoxin commatoken in any case i wouldnt try their nutella cookies unless youre aware of the sideeffects periodtoken  the parfaits are stingy on fruits and overpriced and a lot of other items seem to be asking for too much pricewise given the lowquality and small amount served periodtoken  the mural on the outside is nice to look at and the whimsical nature of the inside makes it seem like its more than it really is periodtoken  its just an industrial bake shoppe that puts out thoroughly average products periodtoken  they do a lot inside the shoppe commatoken so many workers behind the cashier making things but usually have many things unavailable yet they have a wide selection of other things to get like hot pockets and ice cream sandwiches both of which are very unusual interpretations of the traditional items periodtoken  thing is everything here tastes like imitation commatoken since the store is named after a pet cat i suppose being a copycat is part of the business model periodtoken  great food to get for your kids commatoken in fact this place caters mostly to children periodtoken      if you want to experience listening to probably the most annoying and redundant pandora stations feel free to stop in and bob your head to the old school jock jams commatoken otherwise bring ear plugs periodtoken            all in all commatoken its kinda gross but you might be into that kind of thing periodtoken  its philly after all periodtoken","4356":"i really wanted to like this place periodtoken like really wanted to periodtoken but after a few trips commatoken ive sadly come to realize that i dont love their donuts periodtoken the flavors are great and very creative commatoken but theyre just too doughy and dense for me periodtoken to be honest commatoken when i read reviews mentioning how light and airy these donuts are commatoken im a bit taken aback periodtoken   maybe im missing the hype and have been heading in on bad days periodtoken maybe they just make their donuts in a style that doesnt match my taste periodtoken","4366":"a mcdonalds seems so out of place here amogst the shishi shops on walnut street periodtoken  that and it is a haven for local down  outs seeking a 1 mcchicken and a coke or coffee periodtoken  i rarely ever set foot in here periodtoken but admittedly i have once or twice periodtoken  yick","4367":"the boneless pork chops with collard greens  were fantastic perfectly cooked pork commatoken beautiful sweet sauce paired with it and greens periodtoken  the music was great periodtoken  good jazz and blues periodtoken which is what made the rest so disappointing periodtoken the jambalaya and etoufe were mediocre commatoken the mojito was horrible as it was all sprite and  what little mint it had was brown  my bloody mary was too spicy and tasted of pure hot sauce periodtoken  though i liked the music commatoken the 5 cover for it was off putting and added 20 to our bill that could have gone to food or drinks periodtoken  the decor is sparse periodtoken   all in all commatoken not thinking of going back periodtoken","4368":"first commatoken this review is for the market commatoken not the dining room commatoken and my order was to go periodtoken  my advice is that if you love this place commatoken do not place a to go order here periodtoken  ive been eating here pretty regularly and have never tried to order take out until my most recent visit periodtoken  one of the people in the group needed to get home quickly but we had been planning on maynards and figured wed stick with it periodtoken  i never considered that the market didnt do carryout and i certainly wasnt trying to be difficult periodtoken it was my mistake and im not trying to be a jerk about asking for a service that isnt offered commatoken i really didnt know periodtoken  i guess the market just seemed like a carryout friendly menu periodtoken    anyway commatoken my issue is the way the lady behind the counter handled the situation periodtoken   i could have handled a polite commatoken we dont do carryout periodtoken   however commatoken she was really rude and clearly irritated periodtoken  there was seriously no need for all of that periodtoken  she went on about how the menu isnt intended for carryout and they dont have proper take out containers periodtoken  ok commatoken i get that you dont do carryout periodtoken  really commatoken ive brought home leftovers plenty of times in what i would consider to be very proper containers so its not necessary to make up reasons why youre annoyed that i asked for carryout periodtoken just tell me that its not something you offer and ill come back next time i can dine in periodtoken    the vibe in this place is usually so fun it was sad to be in there both ordering and listening to other people order periodtoken she was pretty short with the guy who ordered after us too periodtoken  he was dining in but had some questions about the menu possibly she was still irritated after my order periodtoken    not a good experience periodtoken  we love it here so im guessing well be back periodtoken  but lesson learned commatoken dine in only periodtoken  and if i see the same person behind the counter im heading across the street to congress which is where we ended up that afternoon periodtoken","4382":"purchased a family size lasagna and it was super expensive periodtoken it just tastes like regular lasagna periodtoken periodtoken wasnt anything fancy about it periodtoken staff member was really nice though periodtoken","4401":"ive gone here a few times and tried the regular and kobe beef burgers periodtoken i would say its better than five guys or shake shack in terms of meat quality commatoken plus they have some interesting sauces periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif they actually give them to you periodtoken  if you customize your own burger make sure you check that you got the toppings and sauce you wanted commatoken a couple of times i came home with my burger only to find that i was missing those key ingredients that make the burger periodtoken at which point i was too lazy to put my pants back on and go outside commatoken leaving me no choice but to begrudgingly eat said burger sauceless periodtoken   ive gotten a different person every time i ordered commatoken one thing they did have in common is that they had no idea what any of their own sauces or toppings were periodtoken if the staff had a little training and cared about getting your order right this place would be great periodtoken as it is commatoken i think ill save myself a dollar or two and go somewhere else for a quick bite periodtoken","4420":"this is my fourth visit periodtoken   its much improved from our first visit but still not yummy periodtoken  the brisket commatoken while not petrified commatoken was still dry and chewy periodtoken  im not sure whether the bun was stale or just not to my liking periodtoken  it was kinda dry too but that might be the way its supposed to be periodtoken  i liked the mashed potato side periodtoken  fairly garlicky periodtoken   coleslaw too saucy for me but not bad periodtoken in general commatoken i love

paid 10 periodtoken00 to taste 5 different wines and decided to sit out on the patio to enjoy the music with our wine periodtoken  apparently we werent supposed to do that periodtoken  the hostess came out and told that most tables were reserved and we should have checked in with her periodtoken  sorry  didnt know that and it was actually surprising as the tables never did fill up periodtoken  the wait staff proceeded to ignore us as we sat there periodtoken  we are people that dine out on a regular basis and we know good customer service periodtoken  maynards needs some help in that area periodtoken  we finally were given menus but by that time maynards had gotten all of the money they were going to get from me periodtoken  best part of the night was the keeling schaffer wine and pizza at empire periodtoken","4436":"when i was shown to my seat of was still wet so i had to use the napkin to finish the job periodtoken place was full and service was poor periodtoken i ordered the

of cupcakes for an office birthday party periodtoken each one was so dry and crumbly i had to throw them away i was told the cupcakes were made the previous night at the same place i bought them periodtoken i called and asked for the manager to issue me a refund of 30 periodtoken i was told by the staff that the manager would contact me commatoken but i wasnt contacted periodtoken  i will

peanut sauce was excellent periodtoken i bet the chicken satay is good periodtoken    we were really thinking that we were in for a good dinner until the entrees came periodtoken not only did it take

our table and immediately wanted us to order appetizers even though the rest of the group was still parking their cars incidentally dont go on a wednesday in the summer commatoken the parking lot is full due to people going to the farmers market periodtoken  the waiter also behaved unprofessionally and kept interrupting and then didnt show up periodtoken when i ask if there is a charge for a

periodtoken 23 and the joint was empty periodtoken  while the drill is apparently that you order at the counter and then sit down commatoken we noticed that there was a small bar and asked if we could sit there the bartender seemed annoyed but indicated that we could periodtoken  we sat down and two wornout menus the laminate was peeling off and the menus were creased and wrinkled to the point that they were difficult to read were thrown down in front of us periodtoken   we decided to start with a cocktail periodtoken  the drink menu included red and white sangria periodtoken  i asked the bartender which she thought was better periodtoken  she responded tersely that they were out of sangria but then added that even if they werent out commatoken they both were good and it just depended upon individual taste periodtoken  okay then periodtoken   my wife then ordered a margarita and i ordered the lojito cocktail periodtoken  my wife liked the margarita but the lojito was too sweet for my taste and i suspect they use something other than the hand squeezed lime juice listed on the menu periodtoken   we ordered queso dip and it was quite good periodtoken  chips were light and crispy and the dip was the perfect consistency periodtoken   not enjoying the lojito commatoken i handed it off to my wife and selected one of the beers on the menu and tried to order it periodtoken  bartender then informs me that they dont have that beer and that the menu was really out of date periodtoken  rather then telling me the handful of beer options that were available commatoken she told me i should walk back up to the front and look at the bottles behind the front counter to see what they had periodtoken  okay then periodtoken   selected a beer all bottles  no drafts and returned to my seat to order periodtoken  asked for a glass with the beer and when it was given to me i was told not to break it because they only had 3 for those people that wanted a glass with their beer

eventually threw down a couple of sets of silverware in front of us and turned her attention back to a couple of regulars that had joined us at the bar periodtoken   enchiladas were very good but not really unique periodtoken  the tacos were a bit more creative and feature locally made commatoken soft flour tortillas periodtoken  the tortillas were definitely better than storebought commatoken but not as good as madetoorder or a good corn tortilla periodtoken  southern fried taco was my favorite periodtoken  local bbq taco was good but the bbq sauce was too strong and overpowered everything else periodtoken   while finishing up our meal commatoken we witnessed multiple interactions between the bartender and customers and it was clear that unless you are a regular that essentially kisses up to her commatoken the bartender has no interest in you or your dining experience periodtoken  maybe the food otherwise could have merited more stars commatoken our overall dining experience was meh at best periodtoken","4528":"i was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if i was sure i wanted to order

they got me sick to my stomach eating them periodtoken the burger was okay commatoken comparable to burger king and good for fast food but not up to what you would get at a good restaurant or diner which after all the hype was what i was expecting periodtoken it wasnt really bad commatoken but disappointing when i expected good and got adequate periodtoken","4533":"meh commatoken a decent place

ill review kachi separately but in short the food was good and im glad i waited but it really wasnt worth the wait periodtoken  philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its

variations periodtoken for example commatoken there was a shrimp roll commatoken shrimp tempura commatoken spicy shrimp tempura commatoken shrimp tempura sandwich commatoken and shrimp tempura with a special sauce periodtoken im sorry commatoken but that is not a good selection  after we ate some sushi we decided to try some of their other dishes as well periodtoken the sesame chicken was pretty good if it was fresh commatoken if it sat out for more than 15 minutes it would dry out and become hard to chew periodtoken also commatoken the fried rice was really bland and had a awkward texture periodtoken   i know people go to noboru for the dinner commatoken but not the dessert commatoken but since they had dessert we had to try it periodtoken on noborus website and facebook page they advertise chocolate covered strawberries and even crepes we saw nothing of the sort periodtoken there were miniature cookies which gave one of my friends and i a laugh because they were advertised as homemade commatoken when they clearly came from the nearest acme periodtoken they also offered 3 small pieces of jello in a bowl commatoken some fruit commatoken mini cakes commatoken mini brownies commatoken vanilla soft serve ice cream and tart frozen yogurt which commatoken as a major fro yo fan commatoken i was very disappointed in periodtoken  the only dessert item that my table semienjoyed were the brownies periodtoken   finally commatoken i do have to say their cold veggies were delicious i read some reviews prior to going commatoken and one reviewer mentioned how great the asparagus was periodtoken im so glad i read their review and made sure to try the asparagus commatoken because it was by far my favorite item there my only suggestion would be that commatoken while good cold commatoken it should be served warm periodtoken i had one piece that was under a heat lamp and was so warm and delicious  overall i would say commatoken avoid noboru unless you really like shrimp and overpaying for food periodtoken it may have been the cleanest buffet i have ever been to commatoken but no matter how clean a place is commatoken if the food is not good then it is not worth it","4594":"i was expecting the burgers to be delicious but they werent periodtoken theyre extremely greasy periodtoken as i was eating mine commatoken a pool of grease formed on my plate periodtoken pretty gross periodtoken also commatoken the waitress was slow so our bottomless fries took a long time periodtoken ","4599":"quick service commatoken but very disappointed by the bagels periodtoken nothing great at all commatoken can probably get better quality bagels in a grocery store periodtoken certainly not bagelicious periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","4600":"pricey food and subpar service periodtoken the half of any sandwich or melt looks like a crust periodtoken only three people and they took forever to make the food periodtoken understaffed on that sunday","4603":"staff is great periodtoken the hot roast beef wasnt hot it was barely luke warm commatoken the bread was warmer than the meat periodtoken took a few bites the flavors are nice commatoken but i didnt finish it was cold periodtoken","4608":"this place has the worst service periodtoken i only have this place 2 stars because they have a waiter there named crystal periodtoken only ask for crystal if you want to have good service periodtoken the rest are dumb bimbos periodtoken last time i ate we wanted some fries commatoken never even got a refill periodtoken and the only reason we had fries in the first place was crystal periodtoken she gave us some before we even ordered and wasnt even our waiter periodtoken  management sucks periodtoken we complained and said well why didnt you say anything to her before periodtoken yeah so she could spit on our food periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","4610":"not the greatest fast food place to hit at night periodtoken  i was driving through one night and had to stop and use the restroom and get some food periodtoken the employees looked at me with almost disqust that i was in there periodtoken not that im one of those people but maybe i was the wrong white girl in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time not really sure periodtoken its pretty much almost downtown past the arch right off 70 so it was convenient periodtoken it was pretty clean for the most part as well periodtoken just didnt like the whole vibe going on inside periodtoken","4624":"the bakery item list is very impressive and most items weve sampled have been really good commatoken especially for a new business periodtoken  be careful however commatoken as they may change their hours with no notice periodtoken for example commatoken this evening we tried to go just after 10pm and they are closed when the hours are until 11pm periodtoken there was no change to the website and no change on yelp periodtoken","4626":"so i generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review periodtoken my husband and i arrived and were placed on the wait list periodtoken no big deal periodtoken some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order periodtoken the pizza was no better than pizza hut periodtoken we were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza periodtoken the artichoke dip came out periodtoken most of the chips were small pieces periodtoken hardly suitable for dipping periodtoken the waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins periodtoken she seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those periodtoken the flat bread pizza was something kids could make periodtoken on grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients periodtoken  to me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price periodtoken expected higher quality for the price periodtoken the appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive periodtoken probably wont go back because there are local nonchain restaurants that are far better periodtoken","4628":"this place is always packed i expected the best periodtoken  when i stepped out of my car it smelled soooo goood  my tummy was ready for some boiled shrimp commatoken corn and potatoes but sadly periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the shrimp was incredibly spongy periodtoken over cooked maybe old the waitress was nice enough to get me new basket but it was the same periodtoken the shell was stuck to the shrimp and to top it all there was no flavor periodtoken my coworkers orderer poboys and they complaint about the bread which was hard periodtoken they ate the inside of the poboy and said the taste was average periodtoken i was so disappointed periodtoken the service was great but  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken whats going on in the kitchen","4635":"so much hype with ehh delivery periodtoken the biscuits and gravy were so hard and lacking flavor periodtoken","4640":"this is one of my favorite places to get coffee so i finally decided to come for breakfast after hearing great reviews and i was not impressed periodtoken i got the open egg sandwich with avocado and after a long wait it finally came out barely warm periodtoken the avocado commatoken which i paid extra for commatoken was unripe and completely inedible periodtoken the breakfast potatoes were good commatoken but overall it was definitely not worth what i paid for it and i definitely would not get it again periodtoken","4643":"we did not get a good experience from the start periodtoken the moment we walked in commatoken the manager greeted us in a lackluster style periodtoken   the buffet was okay commatoken most of the food was lukewarm periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhich is never good for a restaurant periodtoken the only dishes that shined through were the chicken tikka masala delicious and the kheer unusually good with a pinch of cinnamon periodtoken the rest of the dishes were just okay periodtoken the rice tasted undercooked periodtoken and while we were eating commatoken the manager started closing down the buffet periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthat is never good while customers are eating it all felt really rushed   all in all commatoken lukewarm food commatoken lousy customer service and the manager was in a hurry periodtoken","4655":"i came again tonight for margarita madness periodtoken it has been over a year since my last visit periodtoken i only went because a friend who was visiting from out of town wanted to go periodtoken also commatoken 1 tacos and 2 periodtoken30 margaritas may have pulled me in as well periodtoken we arrived at 8 and waited 25 minutes and we still had not been asked for our drink order periodtoken we decided to go inside to the bar to order our margaritas periodtoken in all fairness they were extremely busy commatoken even out on the patio where we sat periodtoken but still 25 minutes for drinks seemed extreme periodtoken since we had so much time to sit around commatoken i had plenty of time to observe the environment periodtoken the chairs outside are hard metal chairs with open slats on the bottom that are just not comfortable at all periodtoken the overhang above the patio was kind of grody looking periodtoken overall our server was nice commatoken probably just overworked periodtoken after we got our drinks commatoken our table of 8 ordered a ton of the beef or refried bean tacos periodtoken they just had lettuce and cheese on top commatoken but not bad for the price periodtoken the chips and salsa was still just meh periodtoken nothing impressive periodtoken ive had better salsa from a jar periodtoken the server did bring out the tacos much quicker than the drinks commatoken but still the whole experience took forever  inside commatoken while waiting at the bar for drinks commatoken i noticed yet again that the live band was extremely loud commatoken far too loud for a monday night restaurant crowd periodtoken at that point i was glad we sat outside  based on this visit id probably give 2 periodtoken5 stars commatoken but im still not totally sold on poblanos","4658":"so periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenive been here a few times for trivia commatoken a beer etc periodtoken its a fine atmosphere to go hang out and have a drink periodtoken my issue is with the food periodtoken so a few of my friends got back from a long day and we wanted to order food bc we were too tired to go out periodtoken we ordered via door step delivery periodtoken  we all went with some basics boneless wings commatoken loaded fries commatoken burger and fries periodtoken considering this is a bar commatoken we figured theyd have a lock on pub food periodtoken we were wrong periodtoken the food was so awful periodtoken and can i just say that i rarely think food is too gross to finish periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwell i didnt want to finish periodtoken we all shared bites of each and we all agreed the food was gross periodtoken the fries had a weird commatoken downright gross taste periodtoken the teriyaki wings were so salty and looked unappetizing with this super gross looking breading periodtoken we ended up throwing all the food in the garbage periodtoken what a waste i would considering coming back for a drink periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenill just make sure ive eaten first yuck","4673":"the food was great if you ever get seated periodtoken while i can understand its a small establishment the person running the seating chart was just awful periodtoken they were not seating by any sort of logical reasoning and lots of people who waited one hour were getting cut by those who waited ten minutes periodtoken if you go be prepared","4684":"like others commatoken ive been a fan of bareburger periodtoken today commatoken i am disappointed and questioning that ill go back commatoken even with a groupon and a 10 credit periodtoken   bottom line i invest in you you need to invest in customer service training and scripting periodtoken   ive been to brooklyn bareburger a bunch of times for dinein and takeout periodtoken no problems periodtoken   i dined in once at walnut st periodtoken and had no complaints worth writing periodtoken today commatoken i ordered takeout commatoken and am now doubting that i will ever go back periodtoken   i ordered the wiki wiki and a full order of sweet fries with curry ginger ketchup to go periodtoken i drank a mexican mule while i waited no complaints about the drink periodtoken i live a distance from the restaurant commatoken so i wasnt expecting the perfect experience when i got home periodtoken i just wanted my bareburger periodtoken   while waiting commatoken i sent the groupon to skeptical friends periodtoken you know commatoken the ones who cant see paying over 20 for a burger and fries periodtoken yeah commatoken i was a fan periodtoken i left happy periodtoken   when i got home commatoken i saw that id been given a side order of regular fries with a single packet of generic ketchup periodtoken disappointing commatoken yes commatoken but not fatal periodtoken what ruined the experience was poor communication periodtoken   the bartender commatoken whom id liked commatoken first responded by saying he hadnt bagged my order not helpful commatoken since we both knew i was there commatoken and already knew this periodtoken then he added that he would look into the problem periodtoken if only he had said the second part without the first periodtoken at one point commatoken he commented that he knew i was so looking forward to the sweet fries periodtoken this sounded condescending commatoken particularly since i hadnt shared any sweet fry fetish with him periodtoken after he offered me a credit for exactly what i was missing commatoken i asked to speak with a manager periodtoken   the managers johns first response was but that was a while ago periodtoken i offered to send a snapshot of what id received commatoken and he declined periodtoken i then told him just how far away i live periodtoken i wont write about how inappropriate it is to begin a customer service call with skepticism periodtoken im not a trainer at bareburger periodtoken but the implications of this sort of approach can be found in the writing of ta nehisi coates periodtoken   then john confused my complaint commatoken thinking id received sweets when i wanted plain fries periodtoken i corrected him commatoken as did a voice in the background periodtoken then john suggested that everything was probably gross by the time i got home periodtoken it sounded and felt as snarkydismissivedisrespectfulunhelpful as it reads periodtoken i asked him to clarify the point of that statement periodtoken he dropped that tactic commatoken and explained that theyd normally deliver the corrected order commatoken but i was too far away periodtoken i expressed that i understood periodtoken   i asked john to tell me what he could do commatoken since a credit for exactly what i was missing seemed inadequate periodtoken he asked me how id paid groupon plus a credit card commatoken told me he could look into contacting groupon commatoken and told me he didnt know how that worked periodtoken i asked again what can you do john i also explained commatoken again commatoken that an even credit wasnt enough for the current disappointment periodtoken   finally commatoken he explained that they usually add a little extra to the credit commatoken to make up for a past error periodtoken he used the price of a side order as an example periodtoken i asked him what the credit would be for exactly what id ordered periodtoken then we got to 10 and an apology periodtoken   i still dont know why it was so hard periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken customer service skills are not automatic commatoken and my sense is that bareburger is winging it periodtoken unfortunately commatoken winging it has had an alienating effect on me periodtoken im contacting bareburger corporate commatoken and groupon commatoken for a more satisfactory customer service experience periodtoken","4702":"love the food but the customer service is horrible they almost never answer the phone commatoken but they answered it tonight and told me i had to be there by 930 commatoken but they close at 10","4709":"i wanted woodfired eggs from sister venue lucky penny and was hoping helena bakery would have them commatoken but they dont periodtoken so i ordered an espresso drink to go periodtoken i waited 15 minutes for that drink why only one barista on a busy saturday morning the owners should reopen lucky penny for breakfast because helena bakery is busier than they can handle and i want my woodfired eggs they have improved their selection of baked goods since last year periodtoken","4714":"concept is good but the taste is below average periodtoken i got a rice bowl with spicy chicken curry and lamb vindaloo periodtoken its not even close to what it should taste like periodtoken staff is friendly  commatoken ambience is good  commatoken concept was great but taste sucks periodtoken i felt it was a waste of money","4722":"i was somewhat disappointed by the burgers at 500 degrees commatoken not the taste but the size periodtoken the burger was exceptionally small and i would have had to eaten two to be full periodtoken   i did have a chance to sample the truffle fries which were pretty solid but overall for the price of the food it was not worth the trip periodtoken","4724":"i usually like the oysters here but this time i had lunch periodtoken  mediocre at best and really enjoyed a disgruntled server dropping the fbomb through the bar cause the bartender was busy and they had to pour a glass of wine periodtoken","4732":"my wife and i went to cinco de mayo on a busy friday night periodtoken we waited over 40 minutes to have our orders taken periodtoken then another 30 minutes for our food periodtoken when it did come out commatoken it was relatively burntdry commatoken and unseasoned periodtoken we also feel like we got a paltry serving portion commatoken and very poor service periodtoken water glasses stayed empty the whole time periodtoken chips were very dry and stale periodtoken they also said they dont have drink specials periodtoken we have been to the cinco de mayo in brentwood many times commatoken received excellent service commatoken food commatoken and drinks commatoken and will return there if we wish to frequent a cdm in the future periodtoken","4735":"i went there because i heard they have good ribs periodtoken well i walked in and the lady said we are not open commatoken probably another hour periodtoken mind you its going on 4pm periodtoken this place serves breakfast commatoken lunch and dinner so i dont know why they would not be open periodtoken i left and came back the next day periodtoken me and my cousin ordered two chicken wing platters periodtoken the chicken had absolutely no flavor or season periodtoken the greens i have had way better commatoken the mac and cheese was ok but i have had better as well periodtoken cabbage was horrid and the yams was really good periodtoken lemon and strawberry cake was really good as well periodtoken icing is very sweet though periodtoken i would only go back to get a slice of cake if i ever went back","4736":"couldve been an off night commatoken but as yelp puts it commatoken meh periodtoken ive experienced better periodtoken the grungy crowd stared me down when i walked in wearing business attire and sat down to wait for a friend periodtoken once she arrived commatoken our frazzled waitress poured glasses of water before flitting off to wait on ten other tables four of which were outside commatoken returning very intermittently periodtoken the front and porch doors were left open breezing 50 degree weather past us for the entirety of our meal periodtoken it was not a comfortable place to eat periodtoken  the restaurant welcomed vegetarian menu in an otherwise carnivorous town periodtoken the hummus was a little dry and my volatoo indian rice bowl too liquid and bland note i like my food spicier than your average american commatoken but it still was below standards after asking for extra spice periodtoken my friend commented her thai peanut sauce was also blander than she had expected periodtoken i would not reorder these three dishes periodtoken  the crowd grew as the evening continued commatoken leading me to think live music began after dinnertime commatoken but i was in no mood to stay after eating periodtoken","4738":"very underwhelming periodtoken if you dont mind bland tacos sans sauce and dry chewy meats commatoken then this place is for you periodtoken also commatoken the food came out icecold periodtoken  i never send food back to the kitchen but actually had to send two tacos back here periodtoken the jerk chicken tacos were like naked commatoken dry chicken breasts in search of some flavor and slaw periodtoken after choking down the first bite i decided to request toppings be added periodtoken   im giving two stars instead of one because i like their patio periodtoken unless its for drinks commatoken i dont plan to return periodtoken","4741":"mothers day brunch periodtoken made reservations so all good periodtoken  friendly greeting and they showed us right to our table periodtoken  steak and eggs commatoken pancakes commatoken omelet periodtoken  all very very good periodtoken  the food here really is excellent periodtoken  weekend bloody mary bar commatoken smaller than others but still periodtoken nice for the price and they have different mixes of spiciness periodtoken  outstanding coffee  commatoken as always periodtoken   the problem is the service periodtoken  our server was lauren who is absolutely in the wrong job for her skills periodtoken it i think this may be the height of her capabilities periodtoken  no silverware on the table periodtoken  she didnt notice and i had to get up and ask for it periodtoken  she had no intuitive abilities as to what should normally accompany food items periodtoken  her demeanor and personality were also very flat periodtoken almost a forced cordiality because she was being forced to serve us periodtoken  what would otherwise be a fantastic five star meal was made uncomfortable by her incompetence as a server periodtoken  i really wish blondies would pay attention to the job their servers are doing periodtoken  so much about this place i like periodtoken  but the service is literally there worst on wash ave periodtoken we may give them another try commatoken just so many other options that we can walk to periodtoken","4743":"i went in at 915 am for breakfast commatoken didnt get my food until 10 periodtoken and there were numerous employees but no one at the register periodtoken they have it set up so you order at the sandwich counter and then get back in line at a different counter to pay periodtoken just seemed dumb periodtoken","4746":"one thing to know about this place is that youll definitely get your monies worth commatoken portions wise periodtoken i was impressed with the scrimp scampi portion i received that came with a choice of salad which was also a nice portion periodtoken  my only major critique is that the shrimp in my scampi were slightly undercookedseasoned periodtoken since the shrimp make up a big part of the dish commatoken that was a slight disappointment periodtoken  because the portions i got were so big i was able to take them home with me and they were nice leftovers periodtoken  despite one pitfall with the shrimp commatoken i would be willing to try them out again periodtoken  im giving them a two for now periodtoken however commatoken i do plan to visit again and possibly do a rereview periodtoken","4757":"went in to eat and the shells were cold and there was little meat to the tacos periodtoken  my advice  go the one in avon periodtoken","4760":"we went on a saturday night around 830 pm commatoken it was a rather small crowd for the weekend commatoken the waiting staff was very nice and professional and on time with orders and requests periodtoken  we ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer commatoken though a bit overcooked it was good periodtoken bread and antipasto were brought to the table commatoken they both were very cold like it was just taken out of the fridge periodtoken for drinks commatoken my gf ordered a watermelon lemonade martini which was super strong  and i just ordered a ginger ale periodtoken for entrees i ordered the linguine ponza which was good but shrimps were a bit overcooked which was disappointing commatoken she ordered the crab ravioli which was delicious periodtoken overall i give this restaurant two stars and think that will be my last time coming periodtoken","4770":"man commatoken i have to say i was disappointed after reading some of the good reviews on here for pomme cafe periodtoken  the space is wonderful commatoken and the service was nice commatoken ok wine selection commatoken but my food was pretty awful periodtoken  i got the duck confit salad periodtoken  it was a heaping hot literally mess of soggy duck not a true confit thats for sure on some bib and romaine odd lettuce with a few dried cherries and huge hunks of sauteed apples periodtoken  underdressed periodtoken  some goat cheese might be a good addition to periodtoken  it definitely needed something periodtoken  it looked commatoken and was unappetizing periodtoken  maybe i just ordered the wrong thing periodtoken  again commatoken space commatoken staff commatoken and wine are ok commatoken but thats about it periodtoken","4780":"you moved you changed why this place used to be a secret gym and now with this recent changes lowered its status periodtoken the service is not with a smile and food is just ok periodtoken i just dont get it periodtoken you moved commatoken no theres no seats commatoken and youre selling tampons and toilet paper and dog food who made these decisions","4786":"live five minutes from this place periodtoken i like the concept and the unique drink options the gingerbeet pink lemonade is awesome big fan periodtoken but the burgers are average at best and over priced periodtoken the meat its self i found was dry periodtoken given theyre going for the whole health conscious scene commatoken there probably using 9010 burgers which is why theyre dry as hell periodtoken the jalape\u00f1o ranch here is amazing periodtoken but for the amount you spend commatoken me and my buddy who is half my size walked out of there still hungry periodtoken so in the end it comes down to average food commatoken good drinks commatoken but leaving unsatisfied","4799":"this place was once my favorite but this recent experience wasnt the greatest periodtoken the waiter left us waiting for 15 minutes without ordering periodtoken we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks periodtoken its not excuse for being busy periodtoken there needs to be a better plan on timemanagement commatoken customer service training commatoken and for proper communication etiquette periodtoken always takes forever for service yet so impatient for the check periodtoken also commatoken theres not enough vegan options and chocolatecaffeinefree desserts periodtoken","4802":"three adults and two teens for postbeach dinner periodtoken great menu with plenty of options periodtoken we did calamari and onion rings for an app along with some adult cocktails periodtoken our meals came out a bit later and i instantly thought joes crab shack periodtoken plenty of white space on the burger and grouper sandwich plates periodtoken maybe a pickle or at the very least commatoken load up the fries periodtoken wife had mahi tacos with mango salsa periodtoken i took a bite periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the mango was not ripe yet and the mahi was dry from over cooking periodtoken i had the key west sampler platter periodtoken it was average at best periodtoken this place is overhyped and primarily a tourist trap periodtoken i will not return periodtoken","4811":"service is pretty slow and the employees seem less than happy to be working periodtoken  they seem like they rather socialize with themselves than the customers or even helping the customers periodtoken  food is good for jack in the box though periodtoken","4815":"the positive  the building is beautiful periodtoken  came in on sunday around 745 after seeing a movie periodtoken  there was an hour wait for a table of two commatoken but the bar was pretty empty so we decided to eat there periodtoken    they had four of their own beer on tap periodtoken we tried the ipa and the saison periodtoken  decent but not great periodtoken i preferred the ipa periodtoken  the menu prices were a little higher than we expected ranging from 14 for a burger to near 30 for other menu items periodtoken    we ordered the special for the evening commatoken lamb gyro and the roasted chicken periodtoken  the lamb was tender but it had very little tzatziki sauce periodtoken  it needed some fresh tomatoes and onion periodtoken  i just used homemade ketchup that was served for my fries periodtoken    they really must like fries here because that is what was served with the chicken as well periodtoken no veggies  just fries and chicken with some ketchup and honey mustard sauce periodtoken  for 18 a plate there had better be some more than meat and a starch periodtoken the chicken was on the dry side periodtoken   the bartenders need to engage all of the customers better periodtoken  at least that is how i felt until some young 20 something ladies came in periodtoken  they seemed to get all the attention they wanted and more from the staff that night periodtoken   i am an out going person and tried to make small chit chat with them but they werent having any of it periodtoken i guess us 30 something couples are left to the side as we dont have date potential for the staff periodtoken   we did get our chicken comped due to the dryness periodtoken the bartender said that according to the souschef they are going to be changing the menu up a little in a couple of weeks periodtoken  i hope that adding veggies are included in the changes periodtoken periodtoken  not sure if we will be back to see if they do periodtoken","4820":"i wanted to like this place  i really enjoy spice shops  but this leaves much to be desired periodtoken its very dusty and run down  i felt like i had stepped onto the set of an episode of dr quinn medicine woman commatoken and not in a good way periodtoken   its one thing to provide customers with an old timey experience commatoken but you shouldnt be so dusty that they feel wary about purchasing food products from your establishment periodtoken   there was nothing that they sold that was so well priced or so rare that i had to have it commatoken so i left empty handed periodtoken   sadly commatoken the spice shop is becoming extinct because if you really need something rare commatoken you can always order it online for a good price from a company like monteray spice co periodtoken   but commatoken if youre in philadelphia and need something quickly or in just the right amount commatoken head to the head nut at reading terminal market periodtoken","4833":"the girl in the drive thru had an attitude with me when i asked about the puppy cup periodtoken she wasnt friendly at all periodtoken when i got the puppy cup it had one dollop of

if its such a problem and hassle ill pay commatoken thats not the issue periodtoken i go to this starbucks all the time periodtoken i dont know what her issue is but she needs to fix it","4834":"got a groupon for the lady jane package for me and my mom to go periodtoken it came with a soup and salad commatoken the soup was so watered down and had no flavor periodtoken and the salad was about 3 pieces of baby spinach and about 2 grape tomatoes and came with an apple vinaigrette periodtoken they didnt let you pick your own dressing periodtoken it also came with a tower of sandwiches and 2 scones for each person commatoken out of about 6 different sandwiches on the platter there were only about 2 that were edible periodtoken the rest were absolutely horrible periodtoken the tea was good and the scones were alright periodtoken but thats all i could ever see anyone going there for periodtoken if you are planning on a meal i would eat somewhere before and just go for tea and scones periodtoken was not pleased with what they had to offer periodtoken i am very happy i just had a groupon and did not pay the full price for this periodtoken i would have been very disappointed and tried to ask for money back because it was just very horrible periodtoken i would not recommend it to anyone unless they just wanted to have tea periodtoken i would not get anything else from there periodtoken","4836":"after reading the reviews commatoken we had high expectations periodtoken  we arrived at 5pm on saturday evening to a packed brewery periodtoken   we were told the wait was an hour periodtoken  there were tables in the bar and we waited until we were able to snag one periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the bar menu is not the same as the dining menu periodtoken  we ordered chips and stuff to munch on while we waited periodtoken   the chips commatoken guacamole commatoken and pur\u00e9ed bean salsa were actually the highlight of our meal periodtoken   i ordered a beer periodtoken  beware commatoken there are no traditional beers here periodtoken  they only sell what is made in the brewery periodtoken   they also do not sell soda periodtoken  my kids had ice tea which was extremely bitter periodtoken  too bad the bartender has not mentioned this to me periodtoken    the real disappointment was the fish tacos periodtoken  as previous people have stated commatoken where is the fish  i felt like i was eating nothing but breading periodtoken   at 12 for two tacos commatoken i expect more then fried batter periodtoken   i also expect red cabbage cole slaw on a fish taco periodtoken  our waitress was nice and so was the host periodtoken not a place i would ever eat at again periodtoken   i am actually surprised at the high ratings periodtoken   my daughter and her friend had the hummus appetizer which they said was pretty good periodtoken","4841":"this is a wonderful pizza place and is true to its roots periodtoken great restaurant to stop in before a concert or lightning game periodtoken only complaint is that the service is lacking periodtoken waited nearly two hours to get our meal after they realized they screwed up a calzone periodtoken","4842":"went for a brunch on a sunday morning and wow didnt realize the wait would be so long for basic food periodtoken heard from many people how good it was and was disapointed periodtoken had the chicken and waffles and was a chicken strip with super dry syrup on a waffle periodtoken expected more for the price","4855":"i go here when going to winco is too inconvenient commatoken or when i need a small amount of items periodtoken even with their just 4 u app commatoken prices are very high periodtoken their organic produce selection is pathetic and most of the time commatoken they are out of things like jalape\u00f1os  or other normal items one might be looking for periodtoken thats annoying periodtoken theyre also usually out of whatever happens to be a good deal periodtoken tonight they were out of the salsa that was on sale periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenso i had to pay the same amount for less than half the size periodtoken the deli selection is good commatoken so thats why i give them 2 stars periodtoken i would give more stars if their checkers were pleasant periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenever periodtoken maybe ive just had bad luck at their store periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut ive gone to this safeway a lot and tonights annoyances were just too much all at once periodtoken i wish their was a local grocery store in sparks

one cherry in it periodtoken then i gave them another try and the mint chocolate chip was low on chips also periodtoken are they cutting back to save money","4879":"pizza is great commatoken but the staff is awful and the delivery is the worst periodtoken we have been devoted customers and truly love the pizza so we try so hard to stay loyal and keep our business with foxs periodtoken periodtoken

help periodtoken  bought the murphys cooked smoked ribs on one visit they were horrible periodtoken  recently bought murphys smoked baked beans periodtoken from the taste commatoken appearance and

up periodtoken the waffle fries themselves were pretty good commatoken stay away from the cheese sauce though periodtoken it was waaay too thick and just had an odd consistency overall periodtoken it tasted like the time i tried to make homemade nacho cheese sauce at home commatoken it had a roux consistency but for my personal tastes commatoken didnt pair well with the fries or even taste particularly cheesy periodtoken  not worth the price in my opinion but i did enjoy the atmosphere periodtoken","4938":"while i love supporting local businesses and its nice to have an alternative to whole foods commatoken i find this place lacking on quality and freshness periodtoken i got a premade vegan sandwich from here before and was not impressed considering the steep price  very dry and lackluster periodtoken a lot of the produce is bruised and slightly wilted periodtoken they also dont carry staples like baguettes periodtoken  its okay if you just need to stop in to grab a few items

with chicken tender  commatoken club sandwich and grilled chicken orders and it took 50 minutes to get our food and it was missing 2 peoples side items  periodtoken while it wasnt the waitresss fault

container to keep it from getting soggy periodtoken there was no sesame chicken in the bag periodtoken i drove back and they admitted they had given me the wrong order periodtoken there was a person sitting there and it was determined it was her food periodtoken they tried to get her to accept the food that i had taken from the restaurant and had been in my car i would never want food that

was convenient to meeting coworkers all staying at various hotels around the convention center periodtoken  my low expectations were easily met periodtoken  as expected the food was incredibly bland commatoken boring commatoken and fairly bad periodtoken i felt like i was in an oldschool chain restaurant commatoken like a place out of the early 90s periodtoken  the adventureless palates were predictably satisfied and were at home with the uninspired menu and the servers schtick periodtoken if you care about food commatoken there are far better options in this town periodtoken  i really want to give it only one star commatoken but that feels a bit like piling on periodtoken","5152":"zoey at the cashier area is super rude periodtoken there was almost no one in there and i had my hands full of stuff and she told me commatoken very rudely commatoken that i could not set down my items at the cashier area for a moment periodtoken i had four water bottles commatoken so it did take up that much space periodtoken there was a sign there that said not to place items there commatoken but i didnt see it as i had dark sunglasses on periodtoken all i had to do was pick up my chicken salad at the other area commatoken which was already ordered commatoken and walk right back over periodtoken there were two other customers in there commatoken thats it commatoken and plenty of room on the counter periodtoken i had tried to place my stuff way out of the way too periodtoken any other customer would have had the entire counter space commatoken but for my little corner at the opposite end

thing had to be the beef wrapped pancake periodtoken it had good texture and good flavor periodtoken other than that commatoken i wasnt impressed periodtoken the crispy tofu was too mushy on the inside periodtoken the beef and tendon soup was very aromatic commatoken which tricked me periodtoken once i tasted it commatoken it was completely lacking in flavor periodtoken it tasted like generic beef broth with some star anise thrown in periodtoken  they did have good service and the place was pretty clean periodtoken they have a tv to watch games and some people were studying there periodtoken  the boba drinks werent bad periodtoken they have all the common flavors periodtoken started at 3 periodtoken75 for a small commatoken add 50 cents for boba and add 50 cents to make it a large periodtoken i think 4 periodtoken75 is pretty expensive for blended ice and powdered flavoring with a little boba thrown in periodtoken","5180":"ive been to plenty of paneras commatoken and im usually a fan periodtoken  tasty sandwiches and decent coffee periodtoken  usually periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i went for breakfast and ordered a sandwich and iced coffee periodtoken  the avocado commatoken egg white commatoken and spinach sandwich was fine periodtoken  nothing to comment there periodtoken  coffee was a different story periodtoken  first off commatoken i was given a paper cup periodtoken  i did a doubletake and thought maybe she heard me say hot coffee instead periodtoken  i checked the receipt and it did indeed say iced coffee periodtoken  thats fine commatoken no biggie periodtoken  i got a little bit of ice and filled up with iced coffee periodtoken  i took and sip and thought i was drinking water mildly flavored with coffee periodtoken  i thought maybe i added too much ice commatoken though in retrospect commatoken not enough time had elapsed for much melting to occur periodtoken  i poured it out and filled up with just the iced coffee periodtoken  same thing periodtoken  okay commatoken maybe thats why i was given a paper cup  because i was going to be forced to go with hot coffee instead periodtoken  most paneras ive been do have a nice spread of coffee periodtoken  this one had decaf commatoken light roast commatoken dark roast commatoken and hazelnut periodtoken  not a great selection commatoken but it would do periodtoken  i went with hazelnut periodtoken  nothing periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  fine commatoken i went with the dark roast periodtoken  i found a worker to report the two issues  iced coffee that tasted like water and hazelnut coffee being out periodtoken  five minutes later commatoken on my way out commatoken i noticed that there was a sign on the hazelnut coffee commatoken which i imagine said it was out periodtoken  i just think for an establishment that sells coffee commatoken you need to keep better track of how much coffee is left periodtoken  especially during breakfast hours periodtoken","5227":"i think this place is over priced and unless you have a coupon commatoken its not worth it periodtoken  most times we call for take out and most often put on hold periodtoken  we use to try and get delivery commatoken but the delivery time they quote is always outrageous so we now opt just for pick up periodtoken    last time i ordered a salad commatoken which they put in the bag with other hot food periodtoken  i certainly didnt want to pay for an already overpriced side salad that was wilted and warm because it was sitting with the hot food periodtoken    the hot wings were unimpressive commatoken small and not worth the  we paid periodtoken  the  bright spot is the pizza periodtoken  they have interesting toppings and i do love the bbt periodtoken  for the money i think theres better places to go periodtoken","5228":"i think im over natural cafe periodtoken the other day i ordered my usual sb veggie grill commatoken and realized it no longer comes with the tahini sauce periodtoken its just grilled veggies on brown rice periodtoken when i asked what happened to the sauce the employee said it now costs 2 extra periodtoken  its already 11 periodtoken50 for the plate grilled veggies and tofu on a bed of brown rice periodtoken unless theres something about tahini being super expensive that i dont know about commatoken i dont get why you would take away a

ever meet periodtoken i go here purely out of convenience periodtoken","5261":"this place somehow is always a miss for me periodtoken thought i would give it a second chance with the chicken pad thai and the brian special banh mi sandwich but both were a miss periodtoken the pad thai was spicy as i requested it commatoken the taste was not as desireable periodtoken the banh mi is very sad periodtoken they are open about getting their bread from the publix down the street and that in itself tells a lot periodtoken not every authentic or good periodtoken its always a miss periodtoken once a year kind of thing  if that periodtoken","5264":"my girlfriend and i stopped by a week ago to eat periodtoken  we both got the teriyaki steak sandwich and two drinks periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe steak was raw in the middle periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe too them back to the window and took the server that they were raw and he said it

the reviews on yelp and had high expectations from this place periodtoken however commatoken the food was bland commatoken americanized and simply not great periodtoken tried their chicken hoagie

you better make it good to be fair commatoken i was at old fishermans wharf the weekend before and then i had pikes place chowder up in seattle within the last year periodtoken did not like the thick chowder texture periodtoken it was thick in the wrong way commatoken where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating periodtoken the clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either commatoken it was 2 independent flavors from each other periodtoken the soup was herby flavored commatoken more so than clam flavored periodtoken  crab cakes the worst crab cake ive ever had i usually love crab cakes commatoken but this one barely tasted like crab periodtoken probably because of all the spice they put into it periodtoken if anything it almost had a slight curry taste periodtoken for a seafood restaurant on a pier commatoken i was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat none of that commatoken the crab was really fine almost like canned texture and there was absolutely no sweet crab here commatoken just spice flavoring periodtoken i was better off feeding 14 to a seagull periodtoken  fresh clams in broth this was the saving grace of the entire meal periodtoken the clams were sooo fresh commatoken super sweet and great texture the broth had a little too much white wine  not enough garlic for my taste periodtoken it was also on the salty side commatoken but the clams omg commatoken the clams one of the clams was bad though dead taste but the rest were fresh periodtoken","5276":"im a pretty laid back guy commatoken but i am big on manners and etiquette periodtoken when i asked the manager hows your day going commatoken his response was commatoken what can i get you  the young man also proceeded to call me dude multiple times commatoken although this is a word i often use commatoken it is definitely not appropriate for a customer you do not know periodtoken i still went back the next day to get some more work done commatoken but found it impossible due to the overly loud commatoken obnoxious conversation of the employees periodtoken im all for a fun work environment commatoken but please respect your patrons periodtoken nice enough people commatoken they just need a course on social etiquette and treating customers with respect periodtoken","5282":"not the best kfc periodtoken  i ordered a family dinner commatoken but apparently it just comes with loads of wallpaper paste mashed fake potatoes as sides commatoken and in the tiniest prunt on menu commatoken shows that any other side is an upcharge periodtoken  ended up paying over 32 instead of 25 because we opted out of fake potatoes periodtoken clerk was ignorant periodtoken got home and many pieces of extra crispy chicken had breading cracked off periodtoken  not agreat value any more for dinner periodtoken","5287":"the kids who work at roast are friendly periodtoken  they screw up things once in a blue moon commatoken but thats to be expected periodtoken

of thick commatoken chewy abomination periodtoken  avoid it at all costs periodtoken  the sandwiches are overpriced by about 40 periodtoken  the drinks are good enough commatoken but theyre not particularly memorable periodtoken","5292":"so the sound quality here is odd periodtoken  we watched the same concert at two different locations commatoken so its easy to compare periodtoken  at this location commatoken i couldnt understand what one of the acts was saying commatoken seriously i understood none of the words periodtoken  i was wearing hearos rock  roll series earplugs commatoken and chalked it up to those at the time as ive never used that type before periodtoken  at the other venue commatoken i wore the same earplugs and understood the vast majority of the words he said periodtoken  so for the most part commatoken it wasnt the earplugs although side note commatoken i highly recommend hearos high fidelity over any other type of earplug for concert going  the show was sold out and the venue was much to tight for the amount of tickets they sold periodtoken  there would be no dancing commatoken in fact commatoken there would be no moving commatoken every person that had to cross the crowd to get to the restroom was an ordeal for both that person and the crowd periodtoken    the crowd was surprisingly rude in a variety of ways periodtoken  this is by no means my first such show commatoken and ive been to the two coheadliners for this particular show combined commatoken probably in the ballpark of 40x commatoken so its not a oh gosh commatoken occasionally folks push or mosh at a show  take note commatoken the exact same 3 bands at another venue in san francisco 2 days later yielded much more polite attendees commatoken a much easier time moving through the crowd commatoken less sticky commatoken less aggressive commatoken less so drunk youre worried they are going to puke on you commatoken and less drinks tossed and splashing us by mistake periodtoken  at the sf show commatoken maybe one person slightly annoyed me periodtoken  at the reno show commatoken there were plenty periodtoken  i get that some of these things are outside of the venues control commatoken but many i believe are exacerbated by having folks so uncomfortable periodtoken  20 less tickets sold would have made all the difference in the world periodtoken    if the person who threw the drink at someone else commatoken but nailing us as well hadnt been stepped on and shoved so many times commatoken would they have thrown the drink  if there was slightly more space commatoken would the dudebro have bothered to actually say to us im going to stand where you are standing now and literally force his way into where we had attempted to stand to stay out of the way of folks who wanted to get somewhere  would my toes have been stepped on so much  would people with long hair have been flpping their locks into your face  would i have had other folks sweat all over me  probably not periodtoken  they sold more tickets than they functionally have capacity for commatoken if anyone was being honest about it periodtoken    their audio control guys have a little cage around their equipment commatoken and the crowd was so large and so tightly packed commatoken the barriers ended up getting moved back like 2 or 3 feet on the side that wasnt secured down periodtoken   this wasnt from anyone intentionally pushing it commatoken it was from people pushing through the crowd commatoken forcing people into it periodtoken  this is really oddly placed commatoken in the middle of the venue periodtoken  not middle back commatoken middle middle commatoken as in half the crowd is standing behind it and not because they dont want to be tightly packed commatoken but because there is no other option periodtoken  there is no place to sit commatoken unless you want to go up to the balcony and not see any of the show periodtoken  the balcony allows just a handful of people to go up and get a view pretty much the top of band members heads periodtoken  and you know commatoken that might have been better than the backs of strangers heads we got to see instead commatoken while being sweated on commatoken and being hit with drinks commatoken and hit in the face with strangers hair periodtoken  as it stood commatoken we watched very little of the actual show because we spent so much time doing problem avoidance periodtoken  all said and done commatoken would i go here again  yes commatoken if there was no better venue option within 4 hours of me and this is a band i really wanted to see or if i thought it wouldnt sell out yielding a bit more functional space periodtoken  i would not however commatoken attend this venue for a band i consider a maybe periodtoken","5293":"meh periodtoken the truffle fries were on point periodtoken  i ordered the 500 burger periodtoken the sauce commatoken i wasnt a big fan of periodtoken it was

a 7 burger periodtoken","5296":"i will start by saying that commatoken after seeing the menu commatoken i did not have high expectations periodtoken  the sushi is cheap and that is typically not a

shrimp tempura roll was the only one with real problems periodtoken  it was overly fried and extremely crunchy commatoken making it hard to eat periodtoken  the sushi chef appears to be inexperienced commatoken as some of the rolls were not cut properly and the ones that had seaweed on the outside commatoken as opposed to rice commatoken were falling apart periodtoken  all in all commatoken not a bad place if you have a craving for sushi but dont want to spend much money periodtoken  just dont expect the greatest periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenof course commatoken the prices reflect that periodtoken","5300":"this is for the fried chicken commatoken for anyone like me who read the recent article about the best takeout at the tp website periodtoken sunday noon commatoken i purchased two

we walked in to when we were seated periodtoken terrible first impression periodtoken   our server was obviously trying to rush us in and out as quickly as possible periodtoken not only that commatoken he talked so fast that we couldnt understand what he was saying at all periodtoken really ruined the relaxing part of going out to eat periodtoken   my boyfriend enjoyed his bison burger periodtoken i commatoken however commatoken was not satisfied at all with my meal periodtoken i ordered the new steak bowl periodtoken steak made to the temperature of my preference with lettuce commatoken avocado commatoken black bean salsa and rice periodtoken the steak was average periodtoken aside from that commatoken the food had no flavor periodtoken the salsa was completely bland and

ive certainly had better elsewhere periodtoken  the accompanying sauce had a decent flavor periodtoken the cornbread is on the sweeter side commatoken and had a good flavor  albeit dry periodtoken  more of an opportunity to slather on some of the honey butter that accompanied the order along with some honey chipotle sauce periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken let me warn you now commatoken the honey chipotle is quite spicy periodtoken  on to the meat   i ordered the pick three sampler at a price of 24 periodtoken  i chose baby backs commatoken pulled pork commatoken and

than 2 12 inches in length periodtoken  pulled pork was moist commatoken larger chunksnot shredded commatoken but again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken maybe a small handful portion at best periodtoken  brisket was sliced thinner than it shouldve been as it lost its moisture periodtoken  it had a very slight smoke ring which did not translate into much flavor periodtoken  portions included 3 small slices about 56 inches in length periodtoken  sides ordered were sweet potato fries and cole slaw periodtoken  fries were great commatoken but the cole slaw was very bitter and inedible  perhaps some ingredients were missed  another order at the table was the pulled pork sandwich periodtoken  this came with a better portion size commatoken but it was dwarfed by the huge bun and massive pile of cole slaw on top periodtoken  4 sauces are on the table sweet commatoken house commatoken stl commatoken and hot periodtoken  sweet  very sweet with a heavy molasses base  good flavor periodtoken  house  vinegar base with a punch periodtoken  stl  another vinegar base with a strong cayenne flavor periodtoken  hot  i didnt even attempt this one  haha periodtoken  overall

amazing cheese curds but i just had my first order of 2018 and they have definitely changed since last fall periodtoken the batter now has an overly pronounced cornmeal flavor and consistency and it really changes the crunch of the curd crust and overall taste periodtoken the cheese itself seemed a bit off too periodtoken there was always a mix of white and yellow cheddar curds in each order periodtoken this visit all the curds were yellow cheddar and had a velveeta feel and taste to them commatoken instead of the normal rich and stringy cheddar cheese periodtoken as a fan of the original version commatoken i hope this was just a temporary change of the recipe or perhaps an offday periodtoken","5388":"i took the wife out last night for dinner periodtoken we stood up front waiting to be

if we were done periodtoken we didnt finish our food and asked to get our food wrapped up periodtoken for some reason commatoken our waiter did not include the side salad and mixed the mac n cheese with the tomato topping it came with commatoken which i took off and put on another plate periodtoken what right does a waiter have to mix someones food why couldnt he just simply transfer the food from the plate to the styrofoam ugh periodtoken","5392":"overpriced commatoken but the food is not horrible periodtoken   whats horrible is the fact that none of the food is prepared fresh periodtoken they often utilize microwaves to heatup preportioned food that may have been cooked many hours commatoken or even days commatoken earlier periodtoken  they have a good selection of drinks commatoken but dont expect good food periodtoken theyre incredibly lazy and uncaring with that part of the business periodtoken","5401":"we arrived in st periodtoken louis this morning and logged into yelp to

the waitress seemed irritated with my questions about the wine list commatoken ignored our basic requests like salt and pepper commatoken water refils commatoken etc periodtoken commatoken and seemed

sandwich served with a smile commatoken go to st james","5868":"if you wish to gamble for free commatoken you will need to bring a non gambling traveler to drop you off and they find somewhere else to hang out as there is now a 10 fee to park periodtoken never have i been to a casino with a parking fee and that includes some that are much nicer than this one periodtoken  very few good penny slots

too periodtoken","5904":"i honestly walked 20 minutes just to get to this place and was excited to give it a try periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  first i was set down at the only place they had

coffee as it tasted like cigarette commatoken weird flavor periodtoken","5916":"i had very high hopes commatoken but was not at all impressed periodtoken  we went for an early dinner and i was so looking forward to the chicken spedini appetizer periodtoken  i ordered it right away and could not wait to try it  the presentation was extremely plain commatoken but if its delicious i can get over a marginal presentation periodtoken  the taste was also very bland periodtoken  the chicken was dry and just not at all what i expected periodtoken    for dinner commatoken we split a st periodtoken louis style pizza and it was good periodtoken    the service was slow and the place was almost empty periodtoken  i cannot imagine why the service was so slow periodtoken  the server was polite

renowned fish because burgers are too greasy commatoken  that was an expensive mistake commatoken","5935":"remember my review on sengyo  i just rather go there or try other sushi places for sushi instead of oh yoko periodtoken  but before i get into that  first off commatoken ive ordered pork katsu as takeout twice here before  once for lunch i think it was 11 and once crazily for dinner 20something periodtoken  dont get me wrong commatoken it was delicious periodtoken  the pork wasnt oily and it had a nice little crunch to it periodtoken  the sauce that accompanied it was amazing tasted almost like a1 sauce commatoken but better periodtoken  wish they gave more  for the lunch portion commatoken there were a side of soup commatoken salad commatoken and fruit periodtoken  for dinner commatoken just soup periodtoken  i dont know about you commatoken but i can easily get this type of dish elsewhere for much cheaper periodtoken  but then again commatoken i got it twice here only because the pork and sauce were super commatoken super good periodtoken  so my boyfriend wanted to actually dine in here because of my previous takeouts and we finally did last night periodtoken  we were so excited commatoken but knew it would be expensive considering how my takeout bills were already high up there periodtoken  we looked at the menu and there surprisingly wasnt any one thing that was particularly eyecatching periodtoken  as we sipped on our tea 5 commatoken we ended up getting tuna flower not on the menu commatoken 10ish as an appetizer as we waited some more to decide on what to get periodtoken  the appetizer was pretty good  although it had a very strong wasabi taste to it and i dont really like wasabi periodtoken  there were small tuna slices that were lined inside a martini glass and with wasabi  roe  tiny shreds of lettuce toppled in the middle periodtoken  the tuna seemed slightly fried on the edges and tasted sweet periodtoken  it was probably the best part of the dinner periodtoken  i give it a 4 out of 5 stars periodtoken  then i ordered a spicy chirashi don 26 and boyfriend got volcano roll 13 periodtoken95 and geisha roll wrapped with pink soy paper commatoken 13 periodtoken9514 periodtoken95 periodtoken  ive never had a chirashi don commatoken but have seen plenty at other sushi restaurants periodtoken  i thought perhaps it would have been similar commatoken but to my surprise commatoken a big plate not really came my way with small commatoken small portions of diced tuna commatoken salmon commatoken white fish and a spoonful of salmon roe topped on some leafy greens and less than a bowl of rice periodtoken  isnt chirashi don popular for the huge slices of sashimi  the dish came with some spicy sauce commatoken but it tasted like the sauce that comes with the popular korean dish bi bim bap perhaps because the owner here is commatoken indeed commatoken korean periodtoken  im not hating commatoken but i thought chirashi don would be served with something like spicy mayo or spicy wasabi type sauce  minus points periodtoken  i took my chopsticks and put streaks of sauce onto the salad commatoken like the server suggested commatoken and it was okay periodtoken  i can manage commatoken i thought periodtoken  then i tried the volcano roll periodtoken  euh commatoken how about there were only five tiny pieces  honestly commatoken it tasted like a spicy tuna roll periodtoken  it didnt even have the usual baked salmon  spicy volcano sauce on top commatoken but i guess every japanese restaurant does it differently periodtoken    at that point commatoken i was disappointed commatoken but still tried the geisha roll periodtoken  despite the prettiness commatoken it was very plain periodtoken  seriously  we had to dip it into the leftover sauce we still had from the tuna flower to make it more edible oh commatoken and sauces commatoken by the way commatoken are 1 extra periodtoken    after having ordered so much commatoken we ordered two more rolls because of how small the other portions were  tigers tail roll with shrimp topped with spicy tuna commatoken 13 periodtoken9514 periodtoken95 and spicy tuna roll 7 periodtoken  as you can see commatoken sushi rolls here are pretty damn expensive periodtoken  the spicy tuna roll seemed to match the prices of normal sushi though periodtoken  anyway commatoken the tigers tail roll was alright periodtoken  it had more pieces than the others commatoken so that was good periodtoken  the spicy tuna roll was just five small pieces commatoken but was also edible periodtoken    overall commatoken dinner was disappointing and were not even picky sushi eaters  the prices were too high for small portions of almost nothing  prices are comparable to a

salad periodtoken   when i told them i didnt think that was right commatoken they argued with me periodtoken   seems odd that every other cosi in the world uses a different dressing periodtoken

some things changed drastically commatoken and not for the best periodtoken the prices doubled or tripled since  about 4 years ago periodtoken the size of the pastries has gone down periodtoken   i used to buy their cream horns filled with the egg white cream periodtoken as the prices steadily rose commatoken the size of the cream horn shrunk periodtoken what is worse commatoken the cream got so disgustingly sweet that you can see the malice behind it periodtoken they are trying to make up for the tiny size with the inordinate amount of sugar in the tiny amount of cream periodtoken i am never

locations on the quieter side to enhance her dining experiences periodtoken we also checked the menu online first to ensure a variety of salad choices as that is my mothers goto menu item periodtoken my middle daughter and i visited upland for a beverage just a couple of weeks prior it was a sunday afternoon and the patio was delightful and quiet periodtoken unfortunately commatoken this visit was anything but quiet or delightful periodtoken  upon arrival were seated on the patio  there were other tables occupied with ladies having lunch looked close to my age commatoken young parents with a

by and were still challenged trying to have conversations at our table commatoken i went inside and asked the bartender only staff member i could find to please turn down the patio music as it was difficult for us to hear our own conversations periodtoken he seemed agreeable commatoken but i seriously doubt the music was modified if it was commatoken it was marginal at best periodtoken its not like im not a fan of def leppard commatoken but i dont want to hear it blaring at a group lunch periodtoken as we perused the menu before ordering commatoken we noticed it was very different than the menu upland has posted online for lunch periodtoken far fewer salad choices commatoken fewer dressing choices commatoken and fewer vegan options all of my daughters are vegans periodtoken mother and i both chose the bibb salad apparently commatoken its a new salad offering with large commatoken leafy greens commatoken strawberries commatoken candied pecans and blue cheese crumbles for approximately 11 periodtoken00 periodtoken when my salad arrived commatoken it was a shallow salad bowl with lots of large salad leaves and a meager amount of the other ingredients periodtoken fortunately commatoken my mothers salad had a few more ingredients in hers and she seemed to enjoy it commatoken so i was pleased with that periodtoken we did both enjoy the salad dressings we chose there are only 3 offered so not a lot of options periodtoken while we were still eating our lunch commatoken our server asks if it will all be on one check and then before we were done eating commatoken casually dropped off the bill to me periodtoken i really do not appreciate it when my bill is dropped off before completing a meal and also before having the dishes cleared from our table periodtoken am i being rushed to pay the bill commatoken and if so commatoken why as a customer commatoken i dont appreciate feeling rushed by servers periodtoken yes commatoken pet peeve of mine periodtoken  i should also mention that i tried ordering the advertised monday drink special commatoken helios pale commatoken but was told they were out of it periodtoken  will i return would likely only do so to pick up a carry out order of the buffalo chili as it is a favorite of my husbands periodtoken  will my 20something daughters return perhaps for a beer commatoken but not for food as upland now has

excited to try one of their ice cream martinis commatoken though i dont remember his choice and i ordered the le fleur a champagne cocktail with st periodtoken germain and hibiscus periodtoken the girl who took our drinks then proceeded to make some dessert so i assumed she told one of the other 37 people behind the bar to make them periodtoken well mine was made and left at the server drink station for some server to stare at while she was eating a salad and working commatoken at the bar periodtoken after about 8 minutes we got both drinks periodtoken my bfs was more like a chocolate martini commatoken literally no ice cream periodtoken and mine was so syrupy if thats a word i could barely fast the champagne or st periodtoken germain periodtoken we finally sat down and our server was great commatoken she greeted everyone commatoken brought waters commatoken went over the specials periodtoken the vegetarian cuban soup was amazing i ordered the chicken salad sandwich with the dressing on the side and my bf got the thursday specialshort rib ravioli periodtoken mine came out with the dressing and his was cold periodtoken our server did take it off but she also never checked

buckaroos for a hohum lunch that includes a beverage commatoken i guess you can periodtoken  jake and max and the mexican post are the most affordable of the bunch  but their offerings arent very appetizing periodtoken  the dibrunos commatoken is just a replica of the one on 18th with a smaller selection periodtoken  tokyo and under the c are pretty pricey and they too commatoken offer pretty average stuff periodtoken  la scala seems to be the better of the bunch commatoken but only if youre prepared to spend a little more for their gourmet pizza entr\u00e9es and salads periodtoken  sook hees produce is fresh and the juice bar is pretty good periodtoken  theyve got a nice orange juicer and i like to treat myself every once in a while to a small one at 2 periodtoken99 periodtoken  id still prefer to get my produce at sues definitely cheaper on 18th commatoken though  even with the walk periodtoken  if the weather is shite and youre stranded in suburban with nowhere to go commatoken the market is a good option  it gets pretty crowded during midday lunch rush go before noon or after 130 commatoken but there are always tables available periodtoken  despite all the glitz

skip it periodtoken","6075":"i do not know what is happened to this place but the service has gone completely down hill periodtoken i cant tell if the kitchen really sucks or the food sits around too long before it comes to the table or everybody is in the back smoking but something is definitely off and it didnt used to be like this periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it was better food and service","6078":"always took 20 minutes to get my salads during my lunch break   my store would order pizzas here regularly because it is also in la cumbre plaza periodtoken it was continually sub par

periodtoken cest la vie periodtoken they charge you for every drink which are overpriced commatoken the food there is pretty subpar and the amount of vip crap is annoying for a person who likes to go

periodtoken they take forever to get you drinks and when they do its 10 for a bloody mary periodtoken comps only come if you spend half your paycheck and lose commatoken of course periodtoken   save

croissant was burned black all around the edges and i had to scrape it off periodtoken i would order the sandwich again but ask for it not to be heated at all periodtoken i ordered the potato with butter commatoken green onions and sour cream periodtoken unfortunately commatoken all i got was a potato with onions periodtoken no sour cream and no butter commatoken which made for a very dry side dish periodtoken i ate half then threw the rest away because dry potatoes dont taste that great periodtoken this place has potential but i dont like having to fix so much myself and throwing away food because basic orders cant be followed periodtoken for over 11 i expected more from my dinner commatoken i wasnt even full at the end","6082":"my husband and i are frequent customers of this starbucks location because we live nearby to it periodtoken we typically drink starbucks anywhere we go due to the fact that they offer the specialty coffee drinks and we run into little to no problems when ordering periodtoken unfortunately at this location commatoken more often than not commatoken we have to send the drink back because its missing something we asked for periodtoken this is alarming because what if someone who was ordering a specialty drink made a certain way due to health issues such as diabetes and their request for sugar free sweetener was ignored ive never ran into this issue so much at any other location that we have ordered from and hopefully the next time a barista repeats the order back commatoken they actually make it the way they are saying it periodtoken","6085":"the food was pretty good however the menu is small so if you are picky i wouldnt come here periodtoken the reason i only gave it two stars was because of the staff periodtoken we just moved to east nashville so we are trying restaurants around the town periodtoken the employees here looked at us like outsiders and barely gave us any attention periodtoken they chit chatted with the tables that had people they knew and left us sitting without acknowledgement for a while periodtoken they were very short with us and just not welcoming periodtoken so if you are a new comer or from out of town i dont recommend this place periodtoken","6086":"im not sure what we missed here judging from the other reviews commatoken but my boyfriend and i were pretty aligned with the whole weve experienced better thing periodtoken for starters commatoken we were starving when we arrived here periodtoken its a really small place so if you want to sit outside there are maybe four tables commatoken youre waiting periodtoken we waited for maybe about 30 mins and jumped right into ordering our main course periodtoken i opted for the lobster tacos and he got one of the crab specials which was pretty overpriced periodtoken im all about getting a little dirty when i eat commatoken but these tacos were more like a burrito  totally overstuffed and whatever was inside so soft and mushy periodtoken i know there was lobster in there commatoken but there was also another type of seafood which i couldnt put my finger on periodtoken i dont know commatoken the combo just didnt sit well with me and i barely ate it periodtoken was pretty disappointing periodtoken its a really cute place periodtoken","6090":"gah periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni hate

mole commatoken beef commatoken and chorizo periodtoken i didnt get any mole flavor with the chicken periodtoken maybe it was cooked in the beef was dry periodtoken the chorizo had good flavor but was too salty for my tastes periodtoken it was all just too dry and the flavor just was not there periodtoken i feel bad writing this review periodtoken i wanted to love it periodtoken ill probably go

ice cream was good i guess periodtoken","6095":"drive thru periodtoken  i asked for cheese periodtoken  why didnt you give me the cheese i asked for  i ordered chili periodtoken  every time ive ordered chili ive gotten the hot packet of sauce with it periodtoken  why not this time  i dont know periodtoken  the side salad and the chili were fine periodtoken  i know why get all bent out of shape just for a mistake  well commatoken i guess its just that i got my order in less than 30 seconds periodtoken  so maybe they should slow down just a little bit and actually double check the order periodtoken  not very hard periodtoken  three line items total on my receipt periodtoken","6096":"was first ones in the place at 11am when they opened periodtoken ordered an appetizer it took 45 min to come out periodtoken steamed mussels periodtoken ordered grilled shrimp salad and shrimp were still raw and even though they were butterflied still had a nasty vein in them periodtoken how gross periodtoken lasagna was ice cold in middle periodtoken ordered a specialty cocktail and they didnt even bother to use any garnish or even give me a straw periodtoken table mates had to leave there food uneaten because they were on a 1 periodtoken5 hour lunch break periodtoken who would have thought lunch would take 2 hours when we were the first ones in the place periodtoken there was just no

other people since going and they had bad experiences also periodtoken","6097":"its probably only good because this is the only asiantaiwanese place periodtoken but i dont know what the hype of the braised beef noodle is because it wasnt even good periodtoken the whole soup was really bland periodtoken the noodles were kind of hard and had absolutely no flavor periodtoken  they have a little

bothered to even fill the coffee commatoken others where extremely nice and helpful periodtoken","6119":"meh periodtoken   the greek salad was an extreme disappointment considering it was 6  dollars periodtoken it was small but more importantly commatoken really bad periodtoken it seemed to be a random assortment of pizza toppings thrown together periodtoken it was 80 spinach commatoken 10 feta and the rest very small amounts of onion and literally 3 small pieces of warm iceberg lettuce periodtoken my advice commatoken do not offer something on your menu if youre not going to do it right periodtoken the small greek pizza was pretty good but the thin crust we ordered was actually quite doughy commatoken which we both were surprised by periodtoken honestly commatoken i do not plan on going back periodtoken","6125":"i ordered the chicken strips and a couple hours later had the worst pain ive ever felt in my stomach periodtoken didnt sleep much and the pain was so bad that i was

was consistently amazing but now not so much periodtoken i live 400 feet away and every time we have ordered in the past few months commatoken food comes out soggy commatoken we show up on time to wait for fries so burgers get cold periodtoken not sure what is missing in the process because they always have plenty of people working periodtoken need to refocus on the details to make the burgers worth another try","6143":"the building is a repurposed commodities exchange from the late 1800s commatoken so if youre going for the history commatoken thats pretty cool periodtoken the gift shops are commatoken well commatoken gift shops and the food is pretty average periodtoken its definitely touristy commatoken but certainly not trendy periodtoken   downside student tour groups tend to converge on the bourse during lunch time so it can get pretty loud and overcrowded periodtoken ah commatoken to be young again  upside you can get the sightseeing tour buses and the horse and carriage

i wasnt willing to pay 7 for a quesadilla with just a little meat and cheese periodtoken any other toppings would cost extra not fair periodtoken if youre looking for warm food like quesadilla or fajitas commatoken this is not the right kind of mexican restaurant for you periodtoken i also feel that the employee at the register should put in some napkins and utensils in the carryout bag periodtoken i often forget to stop and get some on my way out commatoken because at almost every other restaurant not chipotle they always put some napkins and utensils in periodtoken only once commatoken i got bad service at this restaurant periodtoken it was late evening commatoken around 9pm commatoken and the employee preparing my tacos kept talking to another employee the entire time

cooked but was assured the bacon was great periodtoken  30 minutes later the sandwich arrived commatoken probably the worst blt i have ever eaten commatoken hard cold bacon commatoken small portion commatoken basically a lousy sandwich periodtoken  i had also ordered soup which was good and a side salad which was marginal periodtoken  left the business after spending 14 including the tip hungry commatoken lunch is my main meal of the day periodtoken  i think this place has potential commatoken but they need to get rid of the blt offering and concentrate on providing satisfying portions for people who are not complete vegans or health addicts periodtoken  good luck periodtoken","6208":"dont expect to get any work done here periodtoken  despite a lovely remodel of the bicycle store that was here commatoken along with a good sized parking lot commatoken there is quite literally not a single table in the entire joint with an electrical outlet periodtoken  no plugging in your phone commatoken computer commatoken nothing periodtoken  sat here for tea which was fine for 20 minutes commatoken didnt even unpack my stuff periodtoken i wont be back periodtoken","6215":"first commatoken i would like to say that i went into this with an open mind and decent expectations periodtoken my first impression of the place was it was dingy for being open less than a year periodtoken there was not much seating and the back and countertops of their work stations were cluttered and needed a good wipe down periodtoken   next commatoken when it came to ordering it was simple periodtoken you choose which ice cream flavor you want and get to add toppings periodtoken i chose the tropical storm vanilla commatoken peach commatoken mango commatoken and pineapple with the same ingredients plus banana as toppings periodtoken the process was really cool to watch and that is how the hype all started periodtoken    once we got back to the car to eat commatoken i was disappointed when i realized it was canned fruit and not fresh fruit periodtoken my friends cookie monster also came with only one cookie in it the ice cream flavor wasnt that outstanding either periodtoken to be honest commatoken this place is definitely overhyped periodtoken","6220":"hard to rate  sushi good commatoken maybe great commatoken miso great commatoken  pad thai not so much periodtoken  either this place cant make pad thai commatoken or every other thai place i have ever eaten cant make pad thai periodtoken  the noodles were bright pink periodtoken  i am pretty sure that they stir fried noodles in the red sauce from the chinese sweet and sour chicken periodtoken  it made a dish that i am calling chinese sweet and nasty noodles periodtoken    order the sushi","6221":"i noticed as we entered the restaurant wasnt busy periodtoken i expected it to be cleaner periodtoken after we ordered and got our drinks we made our way to a table periodtoken had to wipe salt and a few frys from the table periodtoken the food was ready quickly periodtoken  i  love the frys periodtoken however commatoken these were so over salted and i mean over salted we were unable to finish periodtoken the fish was way too greasy periodtoken once again i was let down periodtoken may have to start going to a different location periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6222":"the vegtable cream cheese was good periodtoken periodtoken large chunks of real crunchy vegtables commatoken but the bagel was everything short of spectacular considering there are not many bagel places in the area commatoken i guess this place will have to do periodtoken","6223":"just ate a burger from there about 15 minutes ago periodtoken had the 500 burger commatoken ordered it medium periodtoken got home and was about to take a bite and i look at the patty and the thing is pretty much raw periodtoken now i can understand it being a bit undercooked but this thing was no where near medium periodtoken very disappointing periodtoken had to cook it up and dirty a pan at home periodtoken didnt taste any seasonings periodtoken  had the truffle fries as well periodtoken while the flavor was great but there was nothing but beat up fries in my bag periodtoken boooooo periodtoken ill prob go back and give them one more shot but the first impression is not very good periodtoken","6232":"restaurant appeared very clean and staff was polite and helpful periodtoken   i ordered a falafel sandwich and it tasted like the fried shrimp they serve because they fry them in the same oil periodtoken this was most unfortunate periodtoken  this is a fast food place and mainly thrives on selling wings and other fried up american fare periodtoken im a little disappointed at yelp for recommending it to me when i searched for falafel periodtoken","6233":"this place used to be great periodtoken  i am guessing an owner or two ago periodtoken their prices were great and their food was fantastic periodtoken  now commatoken they are just another sandwich place in south philly periodtoken  my wife commatoken daughter commatoken and i have ordered there for years periodtoken  we would always get one of their little pizzas and a couple of sandwiches periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken they dont offer the pizzas anymore periodtoken  my 2 year old daughter loved their pizza commatoken but since they dont offer it anymore we just order city pizza all the time if she wants pizza periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenoh and they dont have pizza rolls anymore either  the sandwiches also seem to have gone down in quality periodtoken  i always try something new commatoken but each sandwich tasted like it was the same dry meat on bread combo periodtoken  sorry amatos commatoken but until you go back to lower prices and higher quality commatoken this guy is just going to support the other local joints","6235":"if youre looking for a late night snackpizza joint commatoken look no further axis is the perfect place to stop by after a night of going out or hanging out periodtoken being one of the very few restaurants that open late nearby penns campus commatoken axis is a solid choice periodtoken even better commatoken they open and deliver 247 periodtoken  however commatoken dont expect much from the quality of their food periodtoken my friends and i ordered a medium pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks periodtoken the pizza was bland and all the topping fells off after taking the slice periodtoken the mozzarella sticks were hard and cheese definitely did not melt in your mouth as you would expect them to periodtoken   despite this commatoken axis is such a great option commatoken or probably the only option that actually delivers late nights but due to its convenient location within the ucity area commatoken ill give it another try","6238":"i am completely unimpressed periodtoken for starters we ordered the smoked onion rings which turned out to be overly breaded grease sponges that both my wife and i found to be inedible periodtoken next our burgers arrived and i was little surprised at the tiny morsel that was brought to me periodtoken as big around as a coffee cup and on a soggy bun periodtoken it was cooked well but come on commatoken 11 really  i think the concept of this place is good and the menu of items is interesting enough but the execution is lacking periodtoken the dining area seemed a little dingy and not very clean with a lack of attention to detail like the big chip out of my salad bowl commatoken the wilting flowers on our table and exposed bus tubs at the entrance periodtoken on a positive note commatoken the cucumber boozy lemonade9 commatokenwow was pretty darn good periodtoken","6242":"i dont get why this place is so popular periodtoken i have been here three times and will never go back periodtoken the food is nowhere near as good as some other options in town athens commatoken blue fig or even fattoush cafe and the service ive received has always been subpar periodtoken  when i first went to kalamatas i was surprised at how it worked periodtoken you go in commatoken order at a counter and then get your own plastic silverware and napkins and pick a seat periodtoken the food is served on styrofoam plates and your drinks are served in styrofoam periodtoken this seems like laziness on the restaurants part periodtoken there are no real waiters to speak of so if something is wrong commatoken you have to take it back to the counterwhere ive had to wait in line just to get a wrong order fixed periodtoken  the food itself is okay periodtoken im not blown away by anything ive had on their menu periodtoken a couple of times ive ordered the hummus with pita bread commatoken which is a big mistake periodtoken the hummus tastes about as fresh as the athenos stuff in the supermarket and the pita bread is served cold periodtoken why it takes so little time to heat up pita bread periodtoken yet another problem that just seems like laziness on the restaurants part periodtoken  ultimately commatoken  my biggest problem with kalamatas is the fact that i can get the same meal on plates with real silverware and receive actual service at a couple other restaurants in nashville for the same price periodtoken i think that for my dollar here i should have gotten a lot more than i did periodtoken","6246":"update 62312  so weve been to tortugas twice in the last year periodtoken  the first time commatoken i had a nice big black chest hair fingers crossed commatoken lets hope it was a chest hair in my taco periodtoken  that kept me from wanting to eat there for a looooong time periodtoken  then we just went back recently and sat down in the restaurant periodtoken  the food was great commatoken hot commatoken tasted fresh commatoken i cant complain at all about the food periodtoken  the server was another story periodtoken  we handed her a coupon and she had an attitude and a tone with us commatoken stating that it had to be called in and would take a few minutes periodtoken  then she walked off leaving us standing at the register until someone else came and took care of us periodtoken  listen tortugas commatoken coupons are incentives that get peoples behinds in your seats periodtoken we dont want to deal with attitude problems just because we have a coupon that you have to do some extra overhead for periodtoken  after such a great meal commatoken we left the restaurant talking about the rudeness of the server periodtoken  thats a shame periodtoken  see you in another year i guess tortugas periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  update  6511  i cant bring myself to eat here anymore periodtoken  the place does not seem clean periodtoken  the last time i was there commatoken i found a hair in my taco periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokena hair periodtoken  a big greasy hair periodtoken  its a shame because tortugas has some things going for it in the food department periodtoken  however commatoken with other choices quickly springing up around it commatoken tortugas needs to get with the program before ill ever go back there if ever periodtoken  for now commatoken even though its been months since i ate there commatoken i think about finding that hair every time i think about tortugas periodtoken  and seriously tortugas commatoken do something about your debit card purchasing system commatoken its pathetic  you have to pay money to do debit  original review  ive always liked tortugas commatoken they are okay periodtoken  i really enjoy their chicken tacos and the nacho chips that come with the orders are really very good periodtoken    they are not a great place to order take out from commatoken its better to go there and eat periodtoken  when i order the chicken tacos to go commatoken i find that they are very water logged when i get them home and the once crispy shell falls apart right in my hands periodtoken  generous amounts of chips and salsa are given and that is always appreciated periodtoken  i do agree that they are overpriced though periodtoken    they really need to update their debit card system or something commatoken it always takes longer than usual when im paying with a card and i think they even have a surcharge for using a card","6247":"not sure if cafe periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken

periodtoken  wow commatoken did i really try to pull off a meme in a yelp review  consistent with previous reviews that have complained about service commatoken this caf\u00e9 is hipsterunfortunately commatoken the snobby and arrogant type of hipster periodtoken  coffee is above average commatoken but why people rave about storemade french press baffles me periodtoken  althogh it does taste better because it is made to order commatoken french press is the frickin easiest way to make your own coffee at home periodtoken","6258":"ill start by saying that im not a coffee buff commatoken but i certainly enjoy a nice cup of coffee periodtoken i have to say that i wasnt wowed by the cafe mocha or the americano that ive had from there commatoken but id still go back to grab  go commatoken because its in my neighborhood periodtoken  grab and go is the way to go commatoken in my opinion periodtoken last time i stopped in commatoken there were at least two dogs sitting obediently by their owners commatoken who were on their laptops periodtoken and it was pretty full periodtoken i was never really the type to linger in a coffee shop alone commatoken though periodtoken  i noticed the set of rules posted by the milk and sugar  they really made me feel welcome periodtoken very inviting set of rules periodtoken appreciative of their customers they are periodtoken","6259":"whats up with quality here really bad periodtoken i got a small mac n cheese and it was cold salad box was half full  seriously like 12 cup of salad and 2 tiny wedges of tomato greek periodtoken not up to quality of other panera s periodtoken maybe they are a victim of own success periodtoken they are swamped at lunch  which could explain the poor quality periodtoken maybe check out sub depot or pie 5  more lunch restaurants are opening in the area periodtoken time to try them periodtoken","6261":"sandwiches are great commatoken i had the best damned turkey 6 with a small fry and a pint of ipa commatoken  without checking price on the beer periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe waitress commatoken while efficient and pleasant suggested another beer periodtoken  sure i said periodtoken  so 15 periodtoken00 worth of beer later i was presented with a 24 periodtoken00 bill  before tip periodtoken  28 periodtoken00 and change for lunch  good food commatoken but this is not the place you want to come for beers","6266":"it was hard to give 2 stars periodtoken  the location is beautiful periodtoken  very quaint and bright periodtoken  workers are very pleasant and helpful periodtoken  i had a large party and the staff were extremely accomodating periodtoken  my issue is with the food itself periodtoken  i have to say tasty but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   i had ordered the high tea for one periodtoken  i was expecting the traditional look of high tea with 3 tiers periodtoken  what i got was a plate with 5 little finger sandwiches commatoken a scone with lemon curd and clotted cream and a slice of cake cut in 2 periodtoken  sandwiches were kind of tasty but the fillings were extremely stingy periodtoken  scone was lovely as well as the lemon curd and clotted cream periodtoken  the soup was a tomato basil and was very tasty but entirely too chunky for the portion periodtoken  it was more of a marinara in consistency periodtoken  i was disturbed to see into the kitchen and see them preparing their vegetable cheese soup and the cheese soup was actually a sauce by ragu periodtoken  the desserts were a gyp periodtoken  it was billed to be 2 cakes and chocolates periodtoken  no chocolates and it was one slice of store bought loaf cake cut into 2 pieces periodtoken    the meal was tasty dont get me wrong commatoken it was just disappointing periodtoken  final note periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif you have allergies to certain foods in the finger sandwiches commatoken they have a strict no substitutions policy periodtoken","6270":"spent a nice evening there with friends periodtoken the white sangria was goos and so was the very small portion of pea tortellini pasta periodtoken the appetizers we had commatoken the crispy artichoke and the charcoal octopus were good but way tooooo salty periodtoken same with the pizzas periodtoken the margarita was better than the burrata commatoken but both we too salty periodtoken","6274":"the service kills me here periodtoken it is horrible commatoken delivery orders take well over an hour and a half periodtoken every time i am seated with my 6 and 8 year old we are ignored for 30 minutes until someone brings us water periodtoken typically our last 3 trips have taken us well over an hour to an hour and half just to get our food commatoken and that doesnt count all the time to close the bill periodtoken the only reason we come here is because they have a good salad and the kids love pizza periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so we meet half way periodtoken next time not making the same mistake commatoken ill eat my salad at home and go to a parlor where we arent ignored periodtoken granted the kids love the pizza commatoken but the service makes me think digorno is a better choice periodtoken","6277":"i remember when i first discovered flying cupcake periodtoken  it was the highlight of my day if i checked facebook and saw that cookie dough was a flavor of the day periodtoken  that is until the day i met the chocolate ganache cupcake periodtoken  sadly commatoken that was about 6 years ago and things have changed periodtoken  prices have gone up inflation commatoken i get it commatoken but quality has gone down periodtoken  my most recent encounter was with the salted caramel chocolate commatoken which sounded like a match made in heaven periodtoken sadly commatoken it was not periodtoken  the frosting had a weird sticky consistency commatoken and the cake was dry commatoken until you got to the middle which was filled with caramel periodtoken  this experience isnt very different from others ive had commatoken but the number of locations and their food truck is why i keep trying periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken theyre everywhere","6283":"every time i come to this location is a different disappointment periodtoken sometimes commatoken they dont have mocha commatoken who runs out of mocha in a coffee place plus commatoken their coffee at this location is watery compared to others periodtoken i may just stop coming here altogether","6290":"you know this is a pretty cool place and they work efficiently periodtoken  if the line gets long an employee comes out and takes orders from the line via remote tablet like at in and out periodtoken   ive had drinks here twice now commatoken one was a black coffee and the other was an americano periodtoken my reason for only two stars is that they serve their drinks kinda weak periodtoken  make them stronger and its a 5star place periodtoken","6293":"i eat a lot of fast food and this is not a top choice periodtoken the automated order machine was broken and it couldnt accept cash for payment so to the long line i go periodtoken like my previous visit the order was wrong on more than one item including a no tomato burger having a big juicy red slice periodtoken   the order had taken nearly 15 minutes to be prepared and the two of us came during non peak hours periodtoken we swear never to return","6296":"third time to fermateria periodtoken im really trying to like it periodtoken the only reason im giving them 2 stars is because the beer is very good periodtoken    this was the first time i was seated at a table that wasnt in the bar area periodtoken it took over 15 mins for our server to stop by the table periodtoken she didnt introduce herself but asked if we needed more time periodtoken really  i dont need more than 15 mins to figure out that there isnt much i would bother ordering from the menu periodtoken i got the kale and egg salad which was totally bland periodtoken i waited 10 mins to flag someone for salt and pepper to add some flavor periodtoken then it took 5 more mins to get it periodtoken there were plenty of empty tables so  not sure what the problem was other than our server was never around and rarely checked in on us periodtoken it took over an hour to get a kale salad and for my dining partner to get his burger periodtoken    the original tired hands has been more attentive in general and at least they have really good bread and cheese periodtoken   i hope they work the kinks out because it is a really nice space and i really want it to be a success periodtoken","6309":"i want to first state commatoken that i was extremely happy to have this supermarket in town periodtoken however commatoken lately the overall state of this store has recently let me down periodtoken the concept of having a kiosk for ordering deli items is perfect but the system does not work periodtoken the first thing i do is place my order and do my shopping commatoken mind you with a 2 year old commatoken then go pick it up and check out periodtoken the past few times i have done this and my order has not been ready periodtoken i get they are busy commatoken obviously that is why i use the kiosk periodtoken  then when i ask about my order they act like how dare i bother them periodtoken recently i got a response that they where understaffed and busy commatoken but really 30 minutes they would never make a person standing there wait that long i take my time shopping due mostly to the fact i have a freakin toddler periodtoken anyway commatoken they just do not have a sense of urgency or even employees that care to be efficient periodtoken i truly hope that this store does not continue to let me down because overall there products and prices are good periodtoken","6310":"there are a lot of places to grab coffee in broad ripple and many of them are warm inviting spaces that make you want to stay periodtoken this place really isnt that periodtoken it is cramped and has a lot going on periodtoken i had a smoothie my first time and a tea my second periodtoken both were just okay periodtoken what really gets me are all of the signs that say outlets are for paying customers only periodtoken theres just something about which i find off putting about that periodtoken not really a place i want to meet someone periodtoken","6313":"not terrible commatoken just not good periodtoken  steak was pretty skinny cut commatoken ordered medium commatoken came super welldone roadkill commatoken and was overseasoned commatoken albeit acceptable periodtoken  potato baked was standard fare and pretty hard to screw up periodtoken  salad was not fresh commatoken and mostlyall iceberg commatoken with a sad little bit of tomato periodtoken  glad i tried it seen this place for years and curious about it periodtoken  will not order from again periodtoken","6314":"my mom loves their steak salad here commatoken so here is my review after 2 visits periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  they do make a decent breakfast here periodtoken  everything seemed fresh commatoken but just standard fare with nothing really worth raving about periodtoken  on my second visit commatoken i made a crucial mistake and ordered the meatloaf periodtoken  obviously frozen commatoken it was sadly served with a thick commatoken gelatinous brown gravy and instant mashed potatoes periodtoken  i wasnt able to finish it periodtoken  a stouffers tv dinner is better periodtoken  really periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  so if you are satisfied with just heated frozen entrees commatoken you make like this place periodtoken  if i get talked into coming back commatoken ill stick with the breakfast side of the menu periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6319":"tourist trap periodtoken the fudge tastes good and they give you samples periodtoken the employees were very pushy periodtoken they asked us 3 times to buy their buy 3 get 1 free combo periodtoken our cashier visibly changed his attitude the last time we declined commatoken we felt like we had done something wrong and got drawn into a conversation over why 2 people didnt need 2lbs of fudge periodtoken when we looked at the bill he charged us over 20 for one half pound slice of fudge commatoken when he had quoted us 10 periodtoken99 for a half pound periodtoken","6320":"after raving about how wonderful acme oyster house on iberville st was to our friends commatoken we were very disappointed in the food at the harrahs location periodtoken  we arrived in nola mid afternoon on monday and were just too hungry to wait in the line periodtoken  excited to see that they had another location in harrahs so we went there periodtoken  very commatoken very disappointed periodtoken  my shrimp po boy was one of the worst ive ever had periodtoken  if a restaurant is going to have multiple branches commatoken the owners should make sure the food is up to the primary locations standards periodtoken","6321":"the dirtiest starbucks ive ever been in periodtoken they do seem super busy so hoping that they were just understaffed today periodtoken","6326":"walked in commatoken waited for customer service commatoken not greeted commatoken had questions commatoken the clerk were busy periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken to busy for customers periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","6331":"it pains me to write this review periodtoken  1 because i have experienced the original sylvias and really wanted it to be similar 2

stopped in for lunch with a friend yesterday periodtoken    the place looks fantastic commatoken is modern commatoken bright and airy periodtoken  i was greeted by the gentleman behind the counter in the catering area periodtoken  he was very nice periodtoken   i head around the corner and find my friend who has a table periodtoken   the server comes over and we order two iced teas and an order of fried green tomatoes to start periodtoken   they come out pretty quickly and are very tasty periodtoken  this was the highlight of our meal periodtoken   our server is unfortunately very frazzled periodtoken  jazmin was her name periodtoken  very friendly but literally for an hour and a half all we had was apologies periodtoken  the place wasnt busy yet so i couldnt understand why she was so flustered the whole time periodtoken   we were friendly  courteous as we were really there to try it and catch up periodtoken   she told us a basket of corn bread would be out soon periodtoken   we each ordered the fried chicken  white pieces periodtoken  it consisted of a breast and thigh periodtoken  my sides  greens  mashed potatoes my friends sides  mashed potatoes and lima beans  the plates arrive after awhile periodtoken  no cornbread commatoken we ask for it periodtoken  she says she will be right back periodtoken   we dive into the mashed potatoes at the same time periodtoken  one bite commatoken that was it periodtoken  they werent piping hot and they were very dry periodtoken  they def needed more butter or cream periodtoken  neither of us went back to them periodtoken   i then tried my greens which were decent periodtoken  not soggy and still a little firm but a good flavor periodtoken   we then tried the chicken which looked amazing periodtoken   the batter had zero flavor periodtoken  no spices commatoken no salt periodtoken  i have never in my life put salt on fried chicken but that is what we had to do periodtoken  it pained me do so periodtoken when my friend said publix makes better fried chicken commatoken that was actually true and saddened me periodtoken   we both picked at it a bit periodtoken  the cornbread the never came periodtoken   our glasses were never refilled periodtoken  when we asked periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken she would apologize and we would still wait another 15 minutes periodtoken  i really cant believe how she ran in 20

cards down and another 20 minutes waiting to check out periodtoken  we had to call her back over to ring them up periodtoken  another flustered apology periodtoken   so it seems she was having a bad day periodtoken  it happens periodtoken it didnt ruin our day periodtoken but the food and lack of service really need to change to bring me back in periodtoken  i would rather cross the bridge to

periodtoken  ive been going here for years since my time in school periodtoken unless youre willing to walk to 10th street commatoken this is one of your few grocery store options in the area periodtoken spruce mart on 1516th and commatoken um commatoken spruce commatoken is decent enough commatoken but thats really a big corner storebodega periodtoken dibruno brothers is excellent commatoken but up on chestnut and 18th commatoken and more of a specialty item storenot where you get your cereal and 2 milk periodtoken theres sues for produce also up 18th commatoken but they just sell produce periodtoken so in the end commatoken youre stuck with the shttenhouse commatoken as i like to call it periodtoken  the produce here is poor to bad commatoken and they make little effort to make it even look fresh periodtoken the green leafy veggies are often wilted commatoken brown commatoken and withered commatoken and the fruit either way to early to put out or commatoken more often commatoken a bit rotted here and there periodtoken   its been a long time since ive bought meats there periodtoken i probably wouldnt commatoken either periodtoken  and so not a huge selection commatoken very poor produce commatoken and an extremely high price point for what you get makes this place a bad choice unless you have no other option commatoken which i guess is how they stay in business periodtoken avoid it if you can get what you want somewhere else and its convenient to you periodtoken","6376":"im really disappointed with this franchise krispy kreme periodtoken ive noticed

receipt periodtoken found that they had added a bread that i did not order periodtoken i confronted them about the additional bread and they had no answers periodtoken it seems as though they added this in hopes that we did not recognize its on the receipt periodtoken was very concerning that maybe we were not the only ones that were overcharged for something we did not order periodtoken as i had all the kids in the car and we did not have time to stick around to figure out why they charged  periodtoken75 more we told them that this was unacceptable and told them that i would report this

conversation at the third persons station periodtoken    when we finally managed to get the attention of one of them commatoken we got down to business periodtoken  after my wife had paid commatoken

my fault but when i reported it to management commatoken they said nothing they could do periodtoken  so i gave them my contact information in the event that the person who took it might turn it in commatoken all they could say was good luck with that one periodtoken      since the person behind me had also requested cash back i thought maybe they didnt realize they took an extra 20 and might return it periodtoken  i think based on their credit card information the management would be able to identify and contact them and ask but they would not periodtoken   since over the years i have

arrived right after me commatoken and couldnt get to the dumpster commatoken so we all had to move out of their way commatoken let them do their job commatoken then go back in place periodtoken  for this getting to know you phase commatoken i ordered a bacon breakfast burrito commatoken a southwest burrito with red sauce commatoken and a lotaburger with no addins periodtoken despite being the

could try it all periodtoken the bacon burrito was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenjust okay periodtoken the hash browns were a big white mush and the green chiles were too hot for me periodtoken i had to pick them out periodtoken teenager agreed commatoken except the chiles were fine for him periodtoken i took one bite of the southwest burrito and actually yelped periodtoken my mouth was instantly on fire they should warn people about the red chile sauce because it was way way too hot periodtoken my lips and tongue were throbbing commatoken and i couldnt eat any more of it periodtoken teenager liked the burrito commatoken except he said it was too small for the price periodtoken the lotaburger thankfully commatoken i didnt put chiles on it was just okay periodtoken it was like a poor hybrid of a whataburger and an innout burger commatoken and neither of us were overly impressed periodtoken  so periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenoverall commatoken my impressions were just okay commatoken but the chiles were too hot while teenager thought it was just okay commatoken but too many onions used periodtoken  a week later commatoken we gave it another shot periodtoken we arrived

before commatoken we divided everything in half so we could sample it all periodtoken  once again commatoken the food was just okay periodtoken the chicken strips seemed small commatoken and were nothing special periodtoken the bun on the grilled chicken sandwich was a sodden mess because of the mayolike sauce they used periodtoken it fell apart quickly and both of us wound up just eating the grilled chicken and leaving the rest of the sandwich periodtoken the fries were  just okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennothing special periodtoken the seasoned fries werent very seasoned commatoken and the onion rings were decent but too greasy periodtoken  so commatoken to recap commatoken in our two visits we tried  a lotaburger a bacon breakfast burrito a southwest breakfast

commatoken and the table miniumums were pretty high periodtoken  i saw a few 15 min commatoken but most were 25 periodtoken  oh  and no free drinks on the gambling floor periodtoken  after an evening commatoken i pretty much had my fill of this place for the foreseeable future periodtoken","6452":"was in the area and never been so stoped in periodtoken glad i got this one off my list periodtoken had nothing i would go back for periodtoken","6458":"my husband purchased a breakfast sandwich combo worange juice for me and i was so sorry afterwards the food was very greasy and not even hot

down and not be so charitable periodtoken   first up  moo shu vegetables periodtoken i usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce commatoken and this had the bonus of including broccoli commatoken baby corn commatoken and mushrooms periodtoken but the pancakes were dry commatoken stuck together commatoken and inedible periodtoken the corn tasted like a can periodtoken not great periodtoken  next commatoken vegetarian beef with mixed vegetables periodtoken the beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan commatoken where the stuff still tastes like flour periodtoken the sauce was good commatoken but the dish was unremarkable periodtoken   finally commatoken we ordered one of the chefs specialties  bean curd with general tsos sauce periodtoken the silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky commatoken sugary sauce commatoken and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside periodtoken very disappointing  no spice commatoken no heat commatoken and just sugar and fat for appeal periodtoken   the two star rating means ive had better periodtoken my absolute favorite is wild ginger in huntingdon valley commatoken and i also prefer china garden inn in willow grove periodtoken i was hoping for a good take out place closer to home commatoken but this isnt it periodtoken","6470":"when our order was called out we couldnt understand the person yelling periodtoken

ordered a ham commatoken egg and cheese sandwich periodtoken i received said sandwich minus the cheese you got 33 of that incredibly difficult sandwich recipe wrong how  also not sure if they normally

hash browns were also gross and soggy and i ended up throwing them out periodtoken   the only reason this isnt a one star is because our drinks were made very well periodtoken and the woman that took our order was very polite periodtoken","6471":"food is great but the service stinks  i came to pick up my food and the lady seemed like she didnt want to be bothered and had a nasty a attitude

great selection normally my favorite new orleans dishes periodtoken  however commatoken they fail on execution periodtoken  the shrimp commatoken crawfish and tasso pasta had tiny frozen shrimp commatoken which is totally unacceptable at 14 and at a place called saltwater grill in new orleans periodtoken  the fried shrimp poboy was mediocre commatoken but doesnt nearly compete with other

carrying periodtoken  i can tell how the crowd is turned over so quick periodtoken  the bulk of the food is prepared ahead of time periodtoken  the wife had waffles and bacon periodtoken  waffles were good but bacon had been sitting for a while periodtoken  i had eggs benedict periodtoken  home fries were good periodtoken  eggs done nicely periodtoken english muffins hadnt been thoroughly cooked periodtoken  the sauce was a whole different story periodtoken  absolutely horrible periodtoken  looked like someone had melted butter and thrown some spice in it periodtoken one plus is the wait staff was friendly periodtoken i left my tip on the table and when paying the check i was asked if i was leaving a tip on the card periodtoken i said no and got a dirty look and snide remark periodtoken had read the reviews on here and my wife had been there before periodtoken  we will not be back periodtoken","6535":"was hoping for a better experience commatoken but ill give them another try next time im in the area because i prefer to support local coffee shops periodtoken i really want to like this place periodtoken  first off commatoken good luck finding the shop periodtoken i knew exactly where it was supposed to be based on gps commatoken but i overlooked the place twice due to poor signage and ended up driving around that same building twice and then wandered further around to a different section of westhaven before finally seeing a sign for it  i feel the drink menu coffee and espresso is a little limited periodtoken they do have different food options including baked goods commatoken biscuits commatoken and even ice cream periodtoken it was after i had ordered and paid for my mocha that i found the muffins wrapped and stored on a centerpiece server on the middle of the big table where patrons were sitting periodtoken so i went back and grabbed one and paid separately periodtoken my mocha was on par periodtoken the muffin was just not very appetizing periodtoken the service was fine commatoken but they didnt go out of their way to smile or make you feel welcomed periodtoken  oh yeah commatoken my lid came off my drink twice commatoken but fortunately it did not result in a major spill periodtoken i had trouble getting the lid to fit on my cup periodtoken  they also have tea and coffee by the bag for sale commatoken as well as gifts periodtoken  the place is beautiful and rustic on the inside periodtoken im hoping next time i have a chance to stop in that i can upgrade my review periodtoken","6539":"not so impressed periodtoken nice facilities but staff wasnt super friendly or helpful periodtoken asked for a wake up call  didnt get one periodtoken they sent someone up to bang on our door  try to use a key to get in periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken no idea it was a hotel employee thought someone drunk was at wrong room periodtoken lots  lots of smokers everywhere  no nonsmoking casino area periodtoken","6547":"been wanting to try this place for a while commatoken but waited for it to be open a little bit to work out the kinks of a new restaurant periodtoken  went right before the lunch rush on a thursday periodtoken  line was pretty short commatoken and moved along pretty fast with plenty of open tables periodtoken     they have an abundance of meats and sides and i ordered the brisket with an addon of sausage and for sides collards commatoken smoked jalapenos and fried pickles and it came with a biscuit periodtoken  all of it looked good but in the end it was meh since my entire entree was basically luke warm almost cold commatoken which was surprising since i watched them take out a fresh brisket and i got the first slices but surprisingly it was not hot not even warm periodtoken  the brisket commatoken albeit room temp commatoken was good periodtoken  the sausage wasnt anything special commatoken but still good periodtoken  as for the sides collards commatoken good but nothing to get excited over periodtoken  they do use ham hock but its missing some more salt and some of the vinegar tang to it periodtoken  the smoked jalapenos are stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon commatoken which sounds amazing commatoken but this is the type of side that needs to be fresh periodtoken  it def had a great taste and probably would be amazing if it had just come out of the oven periodtoken  the fried pickles had the potential to be amazing commatoken they use thick cut round garlic pickles my fav but then they just put way too much breading on them that if you ate them with the breading you lost the taste of the pickle periodtoken  finally commatoken the biscuit periodtoken  it look good commatoken its a heavy dense kind not light and flaky at all and i commented on if it was hot that butter and honey would be amazing on it but alas it was not hot and there was no butter to be found commatoken though didnt see honey periodtoken    so all in all commatoken it was just okay periodtoken  it has the potential to be great commatoken but with everything being luke warm and mostly bland it just turned me off periodtoken  there are other bbq places around that are just as good so im not sure ill be back periodtoken","6549":"definitely dont come here without the intention of staying for a couple of hours  this place has won awards for their beer but definitely not the service periodtoken we waited for about 20 minutes without anyone in front of us and had 1 sample periodtoken we really wanted to buy a couple of growlers for a cookout but i guess well just have to stick with buying cans at other retailers periodtoken","6554":"its a combined taco bell  kfc commatoken which is a plus periodtoken  however the staff at this location apparently cant be bothered to clean the lobby periodtoken despite the fact that the place was almost completely empty at the time i visited commatoken there wasnt a clean table in the restaurant periodtoken","6555":"first the wrap was quite good periodtoken it was the service and the attitude i did not like periodtoken  it is total self serve periodtoken  they yell out when your drink is done so you have to listen until it is ready the come get it periodtoken  then you have to come get your wrap when it is ready periodtoken  but when you pay with a credit card it prompts you for a tip periodtoken  a tip for what periodtoken  i had to find my own table periodtoken  i had to go to the counter to order periodtoken  i have to go back to the counter twice to get my order periodtoken  they couldnt even combine my chai and my wrap into one trip periodtoken  arrogant and greedy asking for a tip periodtoken  wont be back","6557":"i really wanted to like this place periodtoken the store is absolutely adorable the store looks like something i dreamed up in kindergarten when i thought the world was still made up of pink frosting and glitter this is a good thing periodtoken  the staff was wonderful as well periodtoken they were quick to give me recommendations and very knowledgeable about ingredients periodtoken   but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe cupcakes were some of the worst i had ever tasted periodtoken i was very excited about this place commatoken so a coworker and i grabbed a sampling of about every cupcake in order to pick favorites for a future larger order periodtoken every cupcake was extremely dry and lacking flavor except for the overall flavor of sugar commatoken sugar commatoken sugar periodtoken my coworkers all agreed and i felt a little embarrassed for pushing fc so hard periodtoken   i again wanted to like this place so much commatoken so i went back for a solo order and expected the same thing periodtoken   perhaps they can play around with some new recipes periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenflying cupcake commatoken you are so cute i just want to like you","6565":"the food doesnt match the prices periodtoken the donuts look delicious but honestly were really just okay periodtoken i wont be returning periodtoken","6567":"mac cheese crab appetizer was unusual periodtoken we think we liked it periodtoken burger had stale bread periodtoken salads were pretty good periodtoken very open sterile and cold periodtoken excellent black ice tea periodtoken","6571":"food was good periodtoken  waitress was ok periodtoken  manager is a pud periodtoken  after ordering an ipa i was brought a glass that was half foam periodtoken  waitress said it would settle periodtoken  ten minutes later asked to get it topped off after it settled to half a pour and still had an inch and a half head  periodtoken  she was afraid to ask the bartender no exaggeration  clearly nervous periodtoken  asked to see a manager and she said he was the manager periodtoken  me commatoken not afraid commatoken went to the bar and asked for a topoff periodtoken  met with a condescending smirk to which i asked is there a problem if youre a pud to me ill be a pud to you periodtoken  after a few pleasantries i walked away with a full beer periodtoken  ordered my next one in a bottle for obvious reasons periodtoken  all over probably three ounces of beer periodtoken  just give me a full pour and not make me wait 15 minutes for the suds to go down periodtoken  any other place would have replaced it immediately periodtoken","6575":"i ordered the grown up griiled cheese today periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenroasted pork with provided cheese on italian bread periodtoken the pork tasted like dirty grill and was very greasy periodtoken my husband had the chipolte brisket steak periodtoken he said it was ok periodtoken the bread fell apart and the brisket was in big chunks","6576":"i have driven past blakes in deming commatoken nm on my way out of hatch so many times and always thought to myself commatoken huh commatoken i really should try them out periodtoken but i never do because i just want to get home to tucson and to be honest commatoken 9 times out of 10 i just put a sparkys green chile cheeseburger in my belly so i wasnt hungry periodtoken when blakes came to tucson commatoken i was really excited  dont believe the hype periodtoken the green chile cheeseburger at blakes is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile periodtoken the green chile is delicious but not very hot commatoken at least for my taste but thats not where i find fault with this burger periodtoken the actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger periodtoken mine was thrown together so sloppily that i had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it periodtoken i literally had to put my burger back together before i could eat it periodtoken and then the grease started dripping off my hands periodtoken honestly commatoken i would compare the burger part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher periodtoken we also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not periodtoken the size of the order of onion rings for the price was not a bargain at all periodtoken  so im glad i finally tried blakes but i really dont think ill be back periodtoken especially when the green chile double cheeseburger i had at whataburger was actually better but then again commatoken my judgement on that one may have been clouded by a hangover periodtoken","6577":"more like 2 periodtoken5 periodtoken   i want to like this place  my kiwi commatoken pear commatoken carrot commatoken wheat grass juice drink was good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenjust not 12 good periodtoken i get that its doylestown and healthy commatoken but that sort of price point precludes repeat business periodtoken    ditch the corny lab coats","6579":"this is part of the gold course commatoken so it was a very dead atmosphere when we went for dinner periodtoken the service was terribly slow periodtoken it was known for burgers and shakes commatoken both were so rich and gross i could not eat them periodtoken sadly commatoken i would have preferred regular fast food periodtoken the shuttle system is extremely slow commatoken so make sure you take your rental car or prepare for a long walk periodtoken","6580":"the juices are good periodtoken i would skip the rest periodtoken very erratic commatoken ive tried everything burritos commatokensalads and its never the same as the time before periodtoken  its almost like they are winging it each time they make something periodtoken  not cheap by any stretch and anything added is extra periodtoken  no hot sauce out but they have some they make which is nasty periodtoken consistently periodtoken the people who work there are generally rude and seem irritated to be there periodtoken and there are always a lot of people working periodtoken i really want to like this place as i am often in the area for business and would love a quick place for something different periodtoken","6581":"i come here for breakfast alot  the egg  scrapple melted with cheese on a croissant is sooo delicious commatoken and only 3 periodtoken75 periodtoken   however commatoken for as many times as ive been in here commatoken ive now been triggered to write a review periodtoken  i actually bought a sandwhich for lunch usually i have salad and its ok commatoken but my chicken sandwhich on croissant was quite dissappointing periodtoken  for 8 commatoken i got cold chicken commatoken on an untoasted croissant commatoken and the cheese wasnt even melted periodtoken  i was expecting a warm grilled chicken on a toasted warm croissant and that is not the case periodtoken  if the chicken is going to be served cold commatoken then it should say so on the menu  like everyone knows cobb salad has cold chicken  but a oven roasted chicken sandwhich as its quoted on the menu should be warm periodtoken  soups are ok commatoken i sampled a few and they were ok periodtoken  not bad commatoken but not good enough to make me buy some periodtoken  i tried the veggie commatoken potato leek commatoken and some kind of lentil curry soup periodtoken    i will not spend my lunch money here periodtoken  only breakfast periodtoken    on another note commatoken the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere with new booths commatoken tables commatoken and upstairs seating is really nice periodtoken","6584":"the salad bar has gone down hill  only 4 salad dressings1 in the bottle from the shelf periodtoken  dirty salad bar and dining tables periodtoken  no forks periodtoken  1 salt shaker commatoken no pepper periodtoken i generally shop here so i can get a great lunch periodtoken guess not  and commatoken i hope the kid cleaning the sneeze guards didnt spray cleaner on the lettuces","6596":"ive been twice few years ago periodtoken  the food is average to me periodtoken  i saw the groupon deal so i thought why not give them another chance periodtoken nothing has changed periodtoken my boyfriend ate half of our food to save room for the dessert periodtoken  we had cowboy burger and turkey burger periodtoken we left half of each burger and a plate of fries periodtoken food still so so commatoken our server was very nice except when we asked for to go box he took the food away and never came back with our left over technically a whole meal commatoken a burger and fries    we found out he threw it away periodtoken  at this point i paid for food that just get throw away periodtoken luckily i used groupon so i didnt pay that much but still its my food periodtoken  i walked away with no leftover that i was looking forward to eat next day periodtoken  periodtoken  ps as you can see below the manager contacted me periodtoken i contacted him back but never heard from him periodtoken i thought at least i will get a free dessert or a burger as their apology periodtoken  nothing no respond periodtoken","6598":"my boyfriend commatoken my friend commatoken and i went here late last night around midnight periodtoken we were just looking for a spot to have a nightcap and talk periodtoken this place was perfect for that periodtoken there were a lot i people at the bar but no one in the seating areas so we sat off to the side near a window looking out onto 116th street periodtoken  thats when the trouble began periodtoken our waitress commatoken amanda commatoken was rude and seemed to be bothered by our very existence periodtoken she never really greeted us commatoken just put menus down and asked what we wanted periodtoken we ordered a round of shots which took 10 minutes for her to bring periodtoken we ordered beers and my friend asked for an orange slice with hers periodtoken it took at least 15 minutes for her to bring the beers and she tells my friend commatoken were out of oranges for the night periodtoken no apology commatoken etc periodtoken she then comes by about 1245 to tell u the kitchen is closing and to take our menus periodtoken she doesnt ask if we need anything periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenher entire attitude was off putting periodtoken she doesnt come back by until 10 after 1 when she tells us that its last call periodtoken i asked what time they closed because the website says 3 and thats what had brought us there periodtoken she stated that theres not a set closing time periodtoken weird commatoken but ok periodtoken she brought the check out immediately and sort of hovered and stares at us until we paid it periodtoken she then takes the cash and goes outside to smoke before bringing the change periodtoken she walked by and just laid the change on the table without saying anything periodtoken   im not sure if amanda didnt care for us because we didnt sit at the bar or if it was because my friend was black or if she just hates customers in general periodtoken ive never felt more unwelcome in an establishment periodtoken  my boyfriend did talk to the bartender who was apologetic and gave him a free shot periodtoken my suggestion is to sit at the bar and avoid the waitress periodtoken stick to beer as they have a great tap list reasonably priced but the liquor is a bit pricey periodtoken the shots of petron silver we had were 9 periodtoken50 each periodtoken","6604":"i will start by saying this food would be really goodit clearly is good quality periodtoken i ordered takeout and it was just so cold that it made the meal unejoyable periodtoken whenever i order takeout commatoken i make sure to get there 5 minutes early in order to prevent taking home cold food periodtoken because im not eating it right away commatoken i want to at least take it home immediately periodtoken when i arrived it wasnt ready yet commatoken which was fine periodtoken i waited and waited and my pickup time came and went periodtoken i waited some more and others orders kept getting called out to be pickedup periodtoken finally commatoken i went to the register and asked them to check on my food periodtoken the bartender reached behind him and grabbed a bag that had been sitting there for at least 15 minutes and said oh it must have just came up now i was taking home food that had already sat around when i had gotten there early to prevent just that periodtoken   i was very disappointed by this periodtoken i would suggest if you are going to eat there commatoken dont do takeout periodtoken dine in for sure periodtoken","6610":"we have been there twice and will not return periodtoken the good both times service was great periodtoken surprising their sides are really good periodtoken the bad tiny portions commatoken very dry meat commatoken over salty ribs and all of their sauces are super watery periodtoken not a good sign for bbq place without great meat and sauces periodtoken if they guys want to survive they need to change their portions commatoken address the super dry meat commatoken over salted ribs and come up with better sauces periodtoken","6615":"my thai ice cream was delicious but may i point out how bad of a customer service i received that sunday i went periodtoken no customers were in there periodtoken the employee did not greet my husband and i commatoken as if we interrupted his time from his phone periodtoken i had asked a question and he replied with a attitude as if i was annoying him periodtoken i asked because it was my first time having thai style ice cream periodtoken then as he handed me my ice cream i said thank you commatoken he didnt reply or even looked up at me periodtoken so rude commatoken i def regret tipping him periodtoken will never return to establishment periodtoken what sucked was we dont even live in philly but still went since i was craving for thai style ice cream periodtoken","6623":"the most stupid supermarket that takes advantage of its proximity to center city and its monopoly as a fullfledged market in order to sell overpriced and expired foods periodtoken pretty much every single thing is over priced while still being of terrible quality commatoken since its been sitting on the shelf for too long periodtoken  bought canned peppers and used it once and a week later it was bad periodtoken   ive been guilty of running in here when in dire need of something but i try to avoid it as much as possible periodtoken","6624":"this chain is normally one of our favorites periodtoken last night for our anniversary dinner not so much periodtoken service benjamin was totally lacking periodtoken almost awkward to be honest commatoken cheese steak egg rolls our favorites were overcooked and extra greasy commatoken periodtoken   waited for drink refills for a long time periodtoken   chicken was overcooked and it tasted like they needed to change the shortening in the fryers commatoken old taste periodtoken potatoes were cold  they did get me new ones periodtoken my wife said her food was just ok periodtoken dessert was lackluster periodtoken  100 later we left feeling disappointed periodtoken we love the iron hill periodtoken hope tonight was just an off night periodtoken","6628":"so commatoken being a employee at a burger joint commatoken i wanted to try 500 degrees periodtoken ive been hearing rave reviews about their burgers and food periodtoken going in for the first time commatoken i was amazed by the many options the menu held periodtoken i went in for a bacon cheeseburger commatoken with jalapenos periodtoken i was greeted by a not so friendly cashier commatoken who seemed to also be the manger periodtoken being my first time i thought he would have helped me understand their system of ordering better commatoken but he was sarcastic and rude periodtoken   other than the lack of hospitality commatoken i will say the food was okay periodtoken the fries commatoken banana shake and the cola w cane sugar was amazing periodtoken the burger on the other hand was very dry commatoken and lacked any type of flavor that i would expect from a burger periodtoken first looking at it commatoken i thought it might be a great homemade burger commatoken but boy was i wrong periodtoken   overall dont expect amazing hospitality from them commatoken if you do order a burger commatoken make sure you add some type of sauce periodtoken everything else was pretty good commatoken and i like that they have plenty of options to choose from periodtoken   im giving 500 degree 2 stars commatoken just for the lack of hospitality and acknowledging the fact that i was a 1st time guest periodtoken also commatoken for the dryness of the burger commatoken the main attraction of a burger joint periodtoken","6631":"i always liked cracked barrel  but today was the worst  wait time to give your name so they can get a table  ready 15minutes periodtoken we get seated and wait 20 to 30 just to get our food we ordered periodtoken took our waitress 15 minutes just to come to our table to apologize for the wait time periodtoken we finally get our plates and one was warm and the other was cold commatokenthey take the plate back to kitchen and replace the pancakes and rest were

the place was almost empty at 900pm on a saturday night periodtoken not a good sign periodtoken we decided to stay to have a beer and an appetizer periodtoken reuben egg rolls were good periodtoken beer was good commatoken but too pricy for draught in my opinion periodtoken atmosphere is horrible periodtoken this restaurant is across the street from the winthrope community commatoken which has amazing food and service establishments and can not compete when sub par service is provided periodtoken i will not be back again periodtoken i can get better food and service at eats across the street periodtoken","6634":"completely over rated periodtoken small selection of donuts with toppings and they didnt taste that great periodtoken","6635":"the fried rice is a decent deal if youre

let us know that the wait wasnt horrible commatoken and offered us menus to look at while we waited periodtoken  the rest of the staff seemed friendly commatoken and it appeared managers were table touching to make sure the guest experience was good periodtoken  its from here that things started to go downhill periodtoken  first off commatoken the seating in the dining room is very cramped commatoken at least where we were led periodtoken  the tables were close together commatoken and the place was stuffed with people periodtoken  it was difficult to move our party to the seats commatoken and even more difficult to use the facilities and eventually leave  especially with a car seat and three little ones in tow periodtoken  if you have small children commatoken car seats commatoken wheelchairs commatoken etc periodtoken  ask to sit in the area where you enter the most space to move about is there periodtoken  the food came out slow  almost an hour periodtoken  the hash browns were cold periodtoken  the bacon was limp commatoken with one nearraw  and we had specifically asked for crisp bacon when we ordered periodtoken  we were missing a glass of milk periodtoken  we were short silverware commatoken napkins commatoken and syrup periodtoken  we had three orders of pancakes on the table with no syrup periodtoken  odd commatoken for a pancake house

periodtoken","6639":"so i love donuts and i love coffee periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut dont go here if you have a specific donut in mind they usually have a ton of iced sprinkled donuts in a ridiculous amount of colors commatoken but beyond that good luck also the coffee is a hit or miss at this location periodtoken i am a frequent visitor here because bellevue doesnt have a whole lot going on but dont go with high expectations","6640":"ive visited this location several times and each time i return commatoken i ask myself why this particular location is the most inconsistent in service commatoken appearance and quality periodtoken as a franchised restaurant commatoken management commatoken hq and employees need to pay attention periodtoken  customer service greet your customer with friendliness periodtoken say please and thank you those words go a long way periodtoken if its an inconvenience to tend to customers commatoken youre in the the wrong line of work periodtoken  the line staff need to work together to make production consistent commatoken  efficient and accurate periodtoken appearance omg wipe down the tables designate an employee to monitor the dining area periodtoken keep tables clear commatoken pick up or sweep crumbs from the floor periodtoken this visit i witnessed an employee walk past and over 2 napkins that were on the floor periodtoken if the dining area looks like crap commatoken what does the food prep area look like food ive had lukewarm burrito bowls  cold tacos periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenpay attention  ive given this location so many chances periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmaybe if the franchisee noticed slow sales numbers theyd reconsider who to put in place

progresso periodtoken    ambiance was zero commatoken but could still be ok like a crab house on themaryland shore that specializes in their food commatoken not the environment periodtoken  went there to check out a place to take guests after a tour of the historical sights commatoken but this is not the place periodtoken  worst thing was the mismatch of the prices with the overall experience periodtoken  for those prices i would have expected waiters in tuxes with linen napkins over their arms periodtoken","6643":"our first visit and we were disappointed mostly periodtoken  im italian so i look for good italian markets and got super excited periodtoken  i admit commatoken it is an experience commatoken going from room to room commatoken section to section selecting goodies periodtoken  ill go from best to worst cause we bought a lot periodtoken  the cheese we bought commatoken while the selection was not plentiful commatoken was very goodenjoyable commatoken albeit pricey periodtoken  the freshmade pizza tasted really good but the crust is just too thick and hard to chew and they dont put cooking instructions on the pizza which they should periodtoken  bought the marinara sauce i make better so i wont do that again commatoken it was too sweet like school cafeteria sauce periodtoken  bought my fave italian pastries sfogliatella the clam shaped multi layer pastry and cannolis periodtoken  the sfogliatella was passable but nothing like what it should be periodtoken  the cannolis were just awful and a huge disappointment  absolutely not even close to authentic the cream was too thick commatoken the shell not fresh commatoken just didnt taste right at all have never thrown a cannoli out periodtoken  bought the premade large eggplant parm periodtoken  we were disappointed maybe because of the sauce commatoken i dont know but i cant recommend it periodtoken  now my sister and brotherinlaw go all the time and purposely for the eggplant parm so periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou decide periodtoken  we have found more authentic italian markets around florida in fort myers marios and miami and cape coral with great authentic sauces commatoken etc periodtoken  if you want the best of the best commatoken then get your italian pastry in new york city at veneiros and get your italian goodies at eataly in chelsea periodtoken  sorry commatoken we are spoiled exnew yorkers so hard to please us periodtoken  mazzaros is ok for the experience and a onetime visit but wont be a staple for us periodtoken","6645":"i am a ridiculously huge fan of taco bell commatoken in the sense that i could eat it for lunch almost every day and then go back for dinner periodtoken  this particular taco bell is the worst i have ever commatoken ever been to periodtoken    the wait times are just outragous commatoken whether in store or in the drivethrough periodtoken  i dont know if it is the staff commatoken or lack of management commatoken or both combined commatoken but something definitely needs to be changed at this location periodtoken  i will say this is the first time in about the 50 times i have been there that my order was completely correct periodtoken  but hell commatoken it should have been considering i was there for 25 minutes or more periodtoken  i should not be able to go to a sit down restaurant and potentially get my food quicker than i would through this fast food joint periodtoken","6650":"meh periodtoken thats really all i have to say about this place periodtoken food was ok commatoken service was awful periodtoken the bartenders were more concerned about texting and laughing with their friends than bringing another drink periodtoken i will be back to see if maybe it was a fluke but at this point i doubt it periodtoken","6653":"1040 am and they are out of dark roast periodtoken no offer to make more commatoken they are out for the day periodtoken  its almost as though they arent a coffee place

 apparently customer service is not part of her job description periodtoken","6660":"i dont usually review chains periodtoken periodtokenbut i think something needs to be said periodtoken i went here today to pick up some coffee and general treats on my way to see a friend periodtoken the staff were so rude periodtoken i mean they couldnt seem to understand my order in the fist place and then were pretty slack about making my order periodtoken and the drinks still turned out wrong periodtoken was pretty disappointed and probably wont be back to this location commatoken especially considering

ordered the italian pork sandwich commatoken which lacked pork and was mostly just bread periodtoken for 14 sandwich  commatoken i expected more periodtoken my friends ordered the nco burger commatoken wings commatoken and the reuben and were all just average periodtoken","6669":"i checked out the menu for taqueria del sol and was excited to try it periodtoken what a disappointment  the service was friendly commatoken although they ran out of tea periodtoken there was a manthe manager commatoken i assumehovering over all the workers commatoken making them nervous commatoken and not improving the service periodtoken he happily offered to order some kid to brew more commatoken but it wasnt done before i was ready to leave periodtoken im surprised they didnt realize they were low when nearly everyone was ordering it periodtoken   the food was the problem commatoken though periodtoken it was bad periodtoken my enchilada was ice cold commatoken but served quickly on a very hot plate periodtoken they subscribe to the school of excess cheese standing in for flavor periodtoken i also ordered a veggie taco commatoken which was good but not great periodtoken   im always eager to try a new place close by commatoken but taqueria del sol may not earn a second visit periodtoken if i get a hankering for that veggie taco in a couple of months commatoken i may go see if theyve ironed out their kinks periodtoken","6675":"when they first opened commatoken i came here a couple of times for dinner periodtoken initially commatoken they were almost as good as minados another bigname buffet but recently commatoken the selection and quality has downgraded a lot periodtoken dont know whos in management now but it sure looks like theyre trying to cut costs down and have become very americanized with their menu periodtoken im pretty sure i can get fries at mcdonalds periodtoken why bother having sushi buffet in their name if the americanized foods outnumbers the sushi they offer was looking forward towards some beef short rib and seafood soup and of course an ample variety of sushi  but those are no longer offered periodtoken me and my group arrived about 3 hours before closing time on a thursday night while it was still sort of packed we had to park in the back periodtoken however commatoken it appeared that they stopped making sushi around that time commatoken leaving only a couple plain pieces on the serving plates periodtoken im sure the 10 cooks they got behind the island couldve replenished that periodtoken the price has went down slightly but the selection went down greatly periodtoken   pros very attentive and sharplooking waiters periodtoken good ambience commatoken interior design periodtoken nice hostess periodtoken nice bathroom periodtoken  cons limited sushi selection periodtoken no premium rolls periodtoken a lot of offerings are americanized or fried everything periodtoken no green tea ice cream or yogurt periodtoken dishes are not replenished fast enough when empty periodtoken   my suggestion go to minados to get your moneys worth periodtoken   until then commatoken i would not be returning until i hear that this place has improved periodtoken","6680":"way overpriced fifteen bucks for a little burger used to give you coleslaw but no more the quantity of the food went down within the past year no more going

low expectations periodtoken there is a honda dealership near by and coffee isnt so great periodtoken worth walking to dunkin for coffee periodtoken however if you order anything but coffee be aware periodtoken i often get the wrong items commatoken wrong quantity or even dont get things periodtoken today was particularly bad periodtoken its mothers day and it seems they have been stockpiling the items because the muffins were sooooo dry periodtoken as in they crumbled just getting the wrapper off the bottom periodtoken it was like eating croutons that were muffin flavor periodtoken very dissatisfied periodtoken coffee was good as always so whatever periodtoken good stinks but coffee is close to where i drop of car so most likely ill be back periodtoken something better than nothing periodtoken","6684":"they must have thought it was my first time salmon smelled horrible and was sweating periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken after losing my appetite i sent the food back commatoken

disaster with so many people cramped into an area with only three exits periodtoken  the design does not give you an area to get relief from the crowd periodtoken  the concert goers were extremely rude periodtoken  i have seen flogging molly in concert almost ten times in different venues and this was the worst experience i have had periodtoken  i will not be driving two hours to come to this venue again periodtoken","6686":"was pretty excited to check out a new korean place especially one mostly dedicated to fried chicken and some random things periodtoken   the chicken itself comes in two flavours crispy deep fried with breading commatoken and sweet  hot sauce periodtoken a bonus is that every order is lovingly deep fried into oblivion in seven minutes periodtoken so youre not getting some old refried leftovers like mcdonalds and their hash browns and your chickens going to be burning hot periodtoken yeah  unfortunately commatoken this is where i felt a bit let down periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the crispy version didnt that much taste to it periodtoken i guess its so you can taste the chicken itself commatoken but it was just wasnt particularly exciting commatoken you know i loved the texture of the breading though periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmmm periodtoken   meanwhile commatoken the hot  spicy chicken has a very strong hot pepper paste taste periodtoken i like cooking korean food and love using hot pepper paste commatoken but i dont like it when the whole thing tastes like nothing but hot pepper paste periodtoken the sauce just had too much of it and i couldnt taste anything else periodtoken   this place could be kinda pricey at 22 periodtoken99 for 10 pieces commatoken as you only get one side to go with that commatoken daikon or fries nothing special periodtoken the chicken is supposed to be 100 hormone free and all that niceness commatoken though commatoken so that could also account for the higher price periodtoken  lots of people do takeout but if you sit in commatoken you can also ask for some tea periodtoken the restaurants very spacious and clean periodtoken i also saw a lunch special for 7 periodtoken   overall commatoken im still looking for a good korean fried chicken joint in edmonton i can keep going back to commatoken but ill probably have to continue satisfying my cravings elsewhere for now periodtoken","6690":"very disappointed periodtoken it wasnt too long ago when this was an outstanding subway periodtoken my husband and i have traveled all around the country and have been to many subways but no one came close to this one periodtoken now all of a sudden they have become the worst periodtoken the last couple of times we ordered a tuna sub the girl behind the counter put such a small amount of tuna on that you could actually see the bread in many spots periodtoken usually they put three scoops of tuna on a foot long but she put one on and then scooped half of that back commatoken on the same size sandwich periodtoken you couldnt even tell there was tuna in it periodtoken our neighbor told us yesterday that they did the very thing to her with the tuna commatoken at the same subway periodtoken i hope they change back to the way they were periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey are starting to lose their best customers periodtoken","6691":"totally overrated

all the orders were wrong periodtoken   my grilled chicken sandwich was missing the ranch dressing commatoken barrys buffalo chicken salad was missing the blue cheese crumbles and the blue cheese

first day periodtoken  dont think we will be back anytime soon periodtoken","6716":"i always considered applebees as an average place periodtoken the food is hohum nothing special periodtoken at times i wonder how long has that food been sitting there periodtoken i believe a lot of food is precooked earlier that day commatoken then microwaved and served periodtoken i think the burgers are cooked fresh though periodtoken just fyi commatoken to any of the previous posters or whomever reads this review periodtoken this applebees on castor is the trainingeval center periodtoken i havent really

periodtoken my boyfriend is a bartender and i am a chef commatoken and understand having bad days commatoken not wanting to be there commatoken wanting to have all your side work done and wanting to leave as soon as you can at the end of your shift periodtoken one of the bartenders was already breaking things down when we ordered dinner at 840 commatoken then both of them started completely breaking down the bar by 9 commatokenscrubbing commatoken pulling out the grates commatoken etc etc periodtoken we both would have had a few more drinks commatoken and we were not the only ones there commatoken so this was not the case of we were the last ones in the bar and didnt realize everyone wanted to go home  periodtoken there is a way to make your customers happy commatoken and quietly do your side work and not alienating them periodtoken we didnt want to make small talk with them commatoken we just wanted service and to not smell cleaning products while we ate periodtoken we typically tip over 20 periodtoken we did still tip commatoken just not as generously  as we usually do periodtoken though the food was good commatoken we will most likely not return because of how horrible the bar staff lacked in professionalism periodtoken","6720":"this place is by my job so i stopped in one evening for lunch food was mediocre at best and its expensive couldve went to bandanas and had better food 19 for a chicken dinner","6723":"one thing is true about great scot commatoken its not great periodtoken id say its average periodtoken first thing is the convenience and that definitely is great commatoken but the downside is whoever runs this place knows fools like me will pay more so we dont have to walk too far so they jack up the prices periodtoken secondly they are always out of stuff periodtoken white meat ground turkey commatoken sells out withing a few hours while dark meat lingers there periodtoken youd think theyd change the orders around periodtoken same with cereal commatoken the cereal i want is always sold out i asked the manager to order something for me and he wouldnt that sucked commatoken but on the other hand the checkout people are really nice periodtoken if only webvan was still around i wouldnt have to settle for great scot periodtoken","6726":"slow commatoken apathetic service periodtoken three people behind the counter commatoken and my

500 was a waste of my money periodtoken  i got the turbo burger because i love spice and pickled jalapenos periodtoken the fries were great crispy with the nice earthy tang of truffle but the burger

had to ask twice to get my cup for water periodtoken really the only good part was the fries periodtoken i wont be back periodtoken","6732":"i really wanted to like this place commatoken but after my second visit they did not convince me periodtoken the first time i went a few months ago the service was spotty commatoken and their breakfast was bland to say the least i had the apple oatmeal which needed heaping amounts of brown sugar to make it taste like anything commatoken also their coffee seems to have a funny taste and always seems to come out cold periodtoken when i went more recently commatoken i found a hair in my oatmeal periodtoken gross periodtoken needless to say commatoken i was planning on returning to try their pancakes commatoken but after the hair experience commatoken i think ill make my own at home periodtoken","6744":"ive lived in nashville my entire life commatoken and ive noticed that this place seems to be a staple for a lot of newcomers and tourists commatoken but im not entirely sure why periodtoken i couldnt have helped but notice the insanely long lines wrapping around the building commatoken so one day i decided to try it myself periodtoken  i was not impressed with the food here at all periodtoken its your average breakfast food commatoken and honestly commatoken the quality is about the same as something youd get at ihop periodtoken while there is a wide variety of different pancakes to choose from commatoken i still wouldnt say that this makes the restaurant worth it periodtoken if youre looking for a good breakfast restaurant commatoken save yourself the time and choose somewhere else periodtoken  however commatoken if youre wanting to try to popular restaurants in nashville but dont care too much in terms of quality for the price

commatoken salmon and tuna periodtoken it was okay commatoken way too much sauce and it took away from the entire bowl periodtoken tip a little goes a long way commatoken stick to minimal toppings and ask for less sauce periodtoken the food itself was overwhelmingly soaked in soy sauce and it kind of ruined my first poke experience periodtoken  service was fine commatoken the glass wall makes it hard to communicate with the employees so make sure to speak a little louder periodtoken they guy who rang me up kept calling me mamma commatoken which made me very uncomfortable periodtoken i dont think i will be going back periodtoken ill wait until my honeymoon to hawaii in 2090 periodtoken","6746":"this pathmark is just bad for produce commatoken meats  seafood periodtoken really bad

were ready to order and he said hed be right back and then disappeared for twenty minutes periodtoken we spoke to the manager who gave us our two beers for free as well as a 10 credit periodtoken so  its probably a nice place commatoken but theyve gotta work on training their staff periodtoken a lot periodtoken","6760":"we ordered 2 calzones commatoken cajun bread and brownies periodtoken the food was good periodtoken delivery was prompt and the employees were polite and nice periodtoken the 2 star review is based on a service error and missed opportunity to fix it periodtoken our order was

the phone commatoken a woman wearing a green shirt came around the corner by the counter commatoken clasped her hands together commatoken and basically shouted at me commatoken mam commatoken we are closed periodtoken instead of approaching me and politely informing me oneonone commatoken she apparently felt like that was an appropriate way to treat a customer periodtoken this was the first time ive been in the location commatoken and although i loved the service the redhead provided commatoken i will not be back periodtoken i do not like feeling like i am being kicked out of a locallyrun establishment because i honestly did not know about the shops hours periodtoken if retaining patrons is an objective of companions company commatoken that employee needs to be reminded

periodtoken the service varies from wonderful to frustrating periodtoken  periodtoken periodtokenit is always disappointing and unappealing to have dirty tables commatoken seats and floors when you are eating periodtoken  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenits understandable if the place is crazy busy but not when there are just a few tables occupied periodtoken  but even if the place is crazy

something a guy might try to make to impress his girlfriend that spend the night periodtoken i do believe a real chef is needed and not that average joe they have back there cooking periodtoken because nothing is new orleans about their food periodtoken i can see why this place is empty and starbucks is winning periodtoken goes to show you people would rather have microwave food then this establishment food periodtoken next time if we decide to come again will be for petals 2 for 1 mimosas she made us cause this was the only thing worth paying for periodtoken","6788":"i stopped off

like my pho spicy","6826":"staff was pretty friendly periodtoken   the food area was a bit of a mess periodtoken   the pinto bean looked like bean paste periodtoken not refried bean periodtoken but bean paste periodtoken very unappetizing periodtoken   the portions were once again very small periodtoken   ordered a burrito and it ultimately looked like a frozen burrito you would get from a truck stop periodtoken   hopefully after 282016 something will be done to get portions consistent as well as do something with the bean paste periodtoken   certainly not my favorite chipotle periodtoken   i miss the days when going to chipotle was satisfying periodtoken","6828":"decent snowball joint where you can drive through for your chill fix periodtoken  they are heavy on the syrup pour and the sizes are large and cheap periodtoken  the ice consistency just wasnt my cup of tea and it seemed more like a snow cone instead of a snowball but that might have been due to the very heavy syrup pour

seated periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken30 mins after our reservation periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates periodtoken   the food was the redeeming quality for my experience periodtoken  my brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner periodtoken  eventually

bland side commatoken though commatoken and the portion was tiny for the price periodtoken it tasted like something i could make at home ive got your typical college student cooking skills periodtoken

commatoken the waiter approaches our table with two more burgers periodtoken he told us our food was here but awkwardly stuttered as he walked away after we told him he was at the wrong table periodtoken a light bulb flashed in my head and i realized that those burgers were actually the ones we ordered periodtoken we had been eating the wrong ones the waiter knew this when he saw the food on our table and craftily walked away commatoken trying to hide this periodtoken this place doesnt deserve 1 star because the food commatoken although bland and overpriced commatoken was edible

love periodtoken when we asked for toast commatoken she told us there was no bread periodtoken like the bread that came with our eggs periodtoken there was none periodtoken so i guess the bread we had was a mirage periodtoken perhaps it was just a bad day periodtoken but id have to be strongly persuaded to ever go back periodtoken note this is the worst review ive ever given i generally only yelp

ladies room needed attention also periodtoken","7016":"i noticed that this place had changed hands when getting my hair cut so came back to give it a try periodtoken  unfortunately i have to give it a mixed review periodtoken  they tried real hard to make my daughters pizza including running to vons for more basil when they ran out periodtoken    unfortunately none of us felt that making a cheese pizza and adding sliced tomatoes and basil to a fully cooked cheese pizza qualifies as a margherita pizza periodtoken  i picked up a antipasto salad for the wife and it was a bed of lettuce with some pizza toppings piled on it and a tub of italian dressing periodtoken  it was unquestionably the worst antipasto salad she has ever had periodtoken  i had the chicken parmesan and i thought it was very nice periodtoken  the chicken was cooked properly commatoken the sauce was flavorful and the pasta was good periodtoken  every place has its good dishes and its not so good dishes and it seems we picked two of the latter periodtoken  we go this plaza several times a week for groceries so maybe i will get up the nerve to try it again to see if i can find another dish they do as well as their chicken parmesan and not one as bad as their antipasto salad periodtoken","7020":"after frequenting fresco pizzeria for over three years commatoken i consistently put up with the poor customer service commatoken occasional long wait times commatoken and undercooked pizza periodtoken today was the final straw periodtoken after not being told the total on my order i was then overcharged for my large pizza periodtoken to top it off there was little to no tomato sauce on my pizza and i was left eating essentially cheesy bread periodtoken poor experience","7024":"the sushi here is less than fresh the 3 or 4 times ive eaten here periodtoken  it is very expensive for a takeout sushi place periodtoken  it also takes very long to get your order periodtoken  there is nothing attractive or enjoyable about the atmosphere periodtoken blah","7028":"the first time i came here commatoken it was interesting because it was new to me the second visit not so much periodtoken decent spices arent a surprise as it is a p periodtokenf periodtokenchang company periodtoken the problem here is that there isnt a lot of meat with the order commatoken you tend to run out of meat before you finish your rice or noodles periodtoken spicy sauce is also limited and does not cover flavor all the rice or noodles periodtoken so not bad but not great either periodtoken consistency between preparations is also hit or miss commatoken at the same lunch visit my daughters meal hardly had any vegetables and they were all thinly sliced commatoken mine had huge pieces of vegetables all were thickly sliced periodtoken","7035":"i have been 3 times  all 3 times the ahi tuna was still semifrozen periodtoken staff is friendly and topping are generic periodtoken overall commatoken food is good commatoken but i wouldnt go specifically for the  tuna periodtoken","7038":"went there to get a steak sandwich for my daughter and the meat was nonexistent periodtoken i literally was able to pull all the meat to one side of the roll so it looked like a sandwich periodtoken","7039":"the excitement of this place has built as we anticipated a nice bbq place in the historic main street area periodtoken so commatoken we went about a month after they opened to get some of their brand new restaurant issues out of the way periodtoken   it was a sunday afternoon periodtoken we were one of 4 tables seated periodtoken the inside and the outside both have this amazing industrial feel that we love periodtoken so commatoken that is a definite plus periodtoken the waitress was extremely nice commatoken when we actually saw her periodtoken the manager brought the whole crew together for quite some time to do some sort of meeting while we were still waiting on our first drink periodtoken i think there could have been a better time to organize this meeting than leave tables waiting periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the service did not seem to be any better after the meeting and like i mentioned commatoken they were not busy at all periodtoken   on to the food commatoken my fiance and i ordered the pulled pork turnovers for an appetizer periodtoken they definitely set the bar high for the rest of the meal periodtoken btwstill waiting on my beer flight sampler at this time periodtoken finally the main course is served periodtoken   we ordered a slab of ribs and a pick 3 wbrisket commatoken turkey commatoken pulled pork periodtoken we also had the macaroni commatoken french fries commatoken and green beans for sides periodtoken i could break down the description of all of these but to save you time periodtoken i would only order the pulled pork and the french fries again periodtoken the rest of the food was dry andor had no flavor at all periodtoken on to dessert commatoken we had pecan pie periodtoken pretty sure it was thawed our store bought from the local grocery periodtoken    this brings us to price periodtoken we spent 64 before tip on food that we did not even finish due to taste not full bellies periodtoken everything is ala carte commatoken so it gets pricey in a hurry periodtoken i could not imagine the bill of the family with 3 kids sitting next to us periodtoken it is a bbq joint but have definitely had better periodtoken  will return for their drink menu one evening but the food will be left to the rest of the customers periodtoken  needed info servicefriendly but mia most of the meal foodmediocre at best except for the pulled pork periodtoken drinksthe beer flight and it was excellent commatoken will return for drinks only atmosphereawesome","7042":"came here for lunch today since we were in the area periodtoken highly disappointing periodtoken the food was pretty bland periodtoken the chorizo burrito was covered in sauce and tasted mostly of melted cheese commatoken as did my wifes ground beef burrito periodtoken the salsa was great commatoken but thats not a reason to come periodtoken if you live in between this place and norristown commatoken head on over to norristown and get some flavorful and exciting mexican food periodtoken","7043":"yogurt isnt my favorite but almost everything about this place is awesome periodtoken   the decor is really bright and modern periodtoken   the flavor selection has something for everyone periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken brownie mix flavor commatoken snickerdoodle commatoken red velvet commatoken blueberry commatoken and many more periodtoken lots of toppings periodtoken you can go to the orange leaf web site to see the current flavors at this location periodtoken  you pay by the ounce periodtoken i would say that this is the most expensive frozen dessert place to which i have been periodtoken it is right up there with cold stone periodtoken  i dont think it is fair to compare ice cream and yogurt periodtoken but commatoken i can compare places that are of a similar expense such as cold stone or pinkberry periodtoken this is definitely not my favorite periodtoken in terms of volume commatoken you do not get the same amount of product for the same price periodtoken for 5 commatoken you are getting about half of the product volume that you would get at a place like cold stone periodtoken also  since yogurt is lighter  it would not be unusual to eat the whole portion at the place periodtoken  when i go to cold stone commatoken i typically buy the largest size and am full when ive only eaten 13rd of it periodtoken i put the rest in my freezer and can typically enjoy it two more times periodtoken thats a great deal for 5 periodtoken cant say the same for this place periodtoken","7044":"super disappointed periodtoken  our waitress seemed high on something periodtoken she was sweet commatoken but couldnt retain any information periodtoken we ordered a bottle of local wine and she served us wine from argentina periodtoken   we werent sure why she didnt open it in front of us commatoken but trusted it was periodtoken after we asked to take photo of wine commatoken because it was so delicious and wanted to support local wineries commatoken she then realized she gave us the wrong kind periodtoken had to adjust bill and just super bummed because she was so scattered periodtoken soup was fantastic and the buffalo cauliflower was excellent periodtoken just drug test before you hire periodtoken","7054":"its really sad that i have to leave a bad review because the decor is cute and the front two baristas were nice periodtoken however if im being honest their coffee and specialty drinks are mediocre at best  periodtoken and too expensive for what it is  also the lady who i assume to be the boss bigger lady with dark hair and one of the workers an asian girl kept leaving the back door open near where we were sitting on a cold day despite us having shut the door after they left it open the first time periodtoken i understand leaving the door open for minute to carry things in and out commatoken but they left the door open for a while just talking while the customers inside got cold periodtoken we promptly left afterwards periodtoken   if you want good coffee and good service commatoken i recommend tradestone which is just a few blocks down periodtoken my friend and i wanted to try something new today commatoken but feine just does not compare periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenin the slightest periodtoken there are way better coffee shops with nicer staff close by periodtoken","7055":"the south street night market aug 15 commatoken 2013 was my 1st night market experience commatoken and quite possibly commatoken my last periodtoken way too crowded commatoken ridiculously long lines commatoken and very few vegan options periodtoken   i dont understand why people get excited about events like this commatoken where its too crowded to even really walk periodtoken not for me periodtoken  meh periodtoken","7059":"i was disappointed that the commons chose tim hortons as the retail space for their ground floor in the first place however commatoken i have given the shop several tries periodtoken the coffee is good commatoken the breakfast sandwiches are fairly tasty periodtoken the staff is usually perfectly pleasant periodtoken the problem i have is that i have yet to get a correct order periodtoken every time i ask for no cheese commatoken they add cheese to the sandwich periodtoken today topped the cake periodtoken periodtokeni asked very clearly for bacon and egg on a bagel commatoken no cheese  what do i see once im at work sausage and egg on a bagel periodtoken seriously commatoken how hard is it to tell the difference since theyve argued with me in the past  it didnt say no cheese  i see no point in wasting my time going back to point out their constant mistakes and only possibly getting a correct sandwich periodtoken my only choice at this point is to stop frequenting this establishment periodtoken","7069":"came here for drive through one morning periodtoken took about 25 minutes between waiting in line and waiting for food periodtoken too long for a breakfast on the run periodtoken been to better mcdonalds drive through periodtoken","7075":"if your in a hurry commatoken this is not the place to come periodtoken took 12 minutes from taking my order to getting my coffee periodtoken","7082":"my boyfriend and i went here on a sunday night a little before dinner time periodtoken   the host said it would be about a 20 minute wait for an outside table commatoken so we said first available is fine periodtoken we waited at least 30 minutes anyways periodtoken   you would assume that a restaurant on a pier would have excellent seafood commatoken right unfortunately commatoken all of our seafood was overcooked and bland periodtoken my cioppino was ok commatoken but all of the seafood was dry and tough my boyfriends lobster pasta was bland and commatoken again commatoken the seafood was overcooked periodtoken   definitely disappointed in the service and the food periodtoken","7085":"for those of you who follow my reviews commatoken you know my husband and i love dining at the hard rock cafes in each location we visit periodtoken with that being said commatoken id have to say i was a bit disappointed with this particular caf\u00e9 periodtoken lets start off with the service periodtoken hubby and i ordered our drinks periodtoken simple periodtoken i ordered a coke and he ordered a captain and coke periodtoken how long commatoken exactly does it take to get this when it is midnight and the caf\u00e9 isnt busy at all after waiting for what seemed forever we received the nachos we decided to share periodtoken they were decent periodtoken the next day we decided to go back to the cafe because we had a coupon i received from my hard rock rewards periodtoken not only was the bartender barely attentive commatoken but she rudely asked if we had already used the coupon the night before commatoken which we didnt because i only had one periodtoken  i was pretty disappointed in this cafe because of the service alone periodtoken ive been to a ton of hard rocks in different states and for the most part the staff are always awesome periodtoken this one commatoken not so much periodtoken","7092":"no flavor periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken far too expensive used the yelp checkin for their free breadsticks and i had to argue to 3 different kids before i paid for my 24 dollar pizza periodtoken   the ingredients are higher quality than most but without any pizza sauce what do they expect me to taste periodtoken better off getting takeout from scordatos","7095":"if you like liquid smoke  \u200d ok food commatoken ok everything periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken theres better around that is forsure periodtoken","7105":"these burgers arent good periodtoken in n out is way better and cheaper periodtoken the fries are good tho","7106":"i found adelaides through google periodtoken i was looking for a special cake for my sons 1st birthday and didnt want to go the typical shoprite or acme bakery way periodtoken now i wish i would have periodtoken this place is expensive periodtoken periodtokenwhich i didnt mind at first periodtoken i was holding a big party for my little boy with all our family and friends periodtoken moonbounces commatoken etc periodtoken when i called and talked to the girl who took my order i had no issue periodtoken she was extremely friendly and helped me decide what i should get periodtoken she knew i wanted specifically an elmo theme periodtoken no big deal periodtoken we pick the cake up that day commatoken looks nice commatoken not like the others i had seen on their website though periodtoken before i had even gotten to bring it out in front of other guests with candles to sing to my son commatoken the whole cake caved in periodtoken it looked horrible and i was embarrassed periodtoken i also felt like a fool for paying that much money for a cake to fall apart and not even look nice for pictures periodtoken and believe me commatoken i was extremely careful with this cake periodtoken would not go back ever again periodtoken","7109":"unusually dirty for a starbucks periodtoken from the sidewalk commatoken front door commatoken exterior trash periodtoken  also the interior of the restaurant and restrooms need cleaned periodtoken this location needs a deep clean inside and out periodtoken open food container in the self serve cooler commatoken just not  what youd expect in such a nice area and of starbucks periodtoken","7111":"its always packed even during times that should be off periodtoken what is the fascination   at least the service is semifast and the food is good by fast food standards commatoken but not worth the wait periodtoken  avoid it like the plague unless you can figure out when theyre not busy periodtoken  i cant periodtoken","7112":"this restaurant has all the makings of a fine dining experience periodtoken  unfortunately the food falls very much short of being mediocre periodtoken  we attended with a small birthday party and they seated us in a very secluded and private spot so the beginning of the evening started off great periodtoken  the server and staff were all extremely courteous and professional periodtoken  the menu is fantastic with a fine selection of sandwiches commatoken pastas and american fare periodtoken  they even have a nice adult beverage selection periodtoken  i got the burger which was great but the entire rest of the family was very dissatisfied with their meal periodtoken  the chicken marsala is almost laughable periodtoken  the sauce has zero thats zero marsala taste and should be called gravy topped chicken and the salt is overwhelming periodtoken  we ordered a side of kale and it was left untouched after the first taste periodtoken  all 3 people who ordered the meatloaf found the special hot sauce to be complete uncharacteristic and simply bad tasting periodtoken  for a disclaimer  my family likes to eat and rarely have a complaint about a meal so to hear so many complaints really emphasized how bad the food was periodtoken  after a complaint the manager came and talked to us and was very understanding and unassuming but could only offer us free desserts periodtoken  we took them up on it but even the desserts were bad no i wasnt having a bad day  the restaurant was periodtoken  the brownie was brick hard and stuck to the pan it was baked in periodtoken  the cookie was hard and tasteless they should take some salt out of the marsala and use it in their cookie recipe periodtoken  ultimately the desserts showed up on our tickets but rather than cause more of a scene we paid the bill and left periodtoken    the good  the scenery commatoken great staff commatoken great menu selection the bad speed of service the ugly  food","7118":"i hate to write how disappointed i was tonight with our experience at pagoda periodtoken when i used to live in philly wed go often periodtoken then after i moved to nj we would make the trip maybe once or twice a year to philly and choose pagoda for dinner periodtoken the owners recognized us and had fantastic service and food periodtoken see previous review   we were in town for the auto show and had decided to return to pagoda periodtoken  after a long day on our feet we were glad to sit down somewhere familiar periodtoken  we were seated immediately commatoken  put in our order by a somewhat hurried waiter periodtoken a few minutes later the waiter came back and barked out no more peking duck periodtoken that was a disappointment on a saturday evening not too late at night that one of their specialties was not available periodtoken we did have shrimp dumplings which were decent  my garden vegetable udon noodle soup  his shrimp dumpling udon noodle soup which were as good as we remembered periodtoken we got the orange chicken not spicy as our shared entree which was average but nothing special periodtoken during this time we also heard a little girl crying loudly for 10 minutes until one of the owners i presume grabbed her hard by the arm yelling at her and taking her to another room to yell at her  hit her periodtoken it echoed through the restaurant periodtoken we did not want dessert periodtoken left a 15 tip and while my husband was in the restroom i heard the waiter say to a girl behind the counter extremely cheap now i dont know if i heard correctly but that was pretty ballsy periodtoken especially since we tried the peking duck rolls which were microwaved rolls with warm lettuce and bits of duck periodtoken basically inedible periodtoken they charged 6 which we didnt dispute periodtoken we have no problem tipping well but he did not earn more than 15  especially given what he said periodtoken oh well pagoda you lose our business to the peking duck house in north brunswick which is only 20 minutes from us periodtoken so many restaurant choices in philly too and our loyalty is done periodtoken","7124":"not coming here again just because its incredibly awkward periodtoken i walked in for the first time and everyone stared at me periodtoken it was made known i was a newbie periodtoken there is only one table with an available outlet for a laptop charger and theres no way to connect to the wifi without going up and asking them how to do it periodtoken the chairs at the tables are uncomfortable  i cant sit here and work like i had planned periodtoken ugh periodtoken just such an awkward experience periodtoken ill stick to starbucks periodtoken","7128":"i like everything about this place but the food periodtoken  owner is nice and polite commatoken menu has quite a few options but the taste of their food is something which doesnt appeal to me periodtoken i have tried alot of their food every time i thought of giving it another chance but i sadly to have say that i did not find anything tasty periodtoken","7129":"today was my first visit and i am less than impressed periodtoken  i liked what i saw on the breakfast menu but opted for a lunch item instead  chicken cordon blu periodtoken  the wait was average for take out but the person behind the counter seemed new and overwhelmed with the small amount of business me waiting to pay commatoken and order she just took and already forgot commatoken and a phone call that she took part of the order from and then told to hold periodtoken   my chicken sandwich was not made the way it was described in the menu which made it not a ccb periodtoken  it was served with a side of what i can only guess was the last remaining breakfast potatoes periodtoken  not only where they not what i was expecting to receive with a lunch meal ordered at 11am commatoken but they were way overlooked commatoken some burnt commatoken and completely cold periodtoken  in addition commatoken most of the pieces of potatoes were just small fragments of what used to be much larger pieces resulting in more of what could be described as potato crumble periodtoken burnt potato crumble periodtoken  burnt cold potato crumble periodtoken  all of this came to almost 10 with tax periodtoken  had i not ordered this meal as take out and left the area it would have definitely been sent back periodtoken my first experience there left me feeling less than satisfied and ripped off periodtoken","7130":"okay commatoken i read there was a big problem with the service times periodtoken   it took nearly 45 minutes for my wife and i to get our food periodtoken we didnt even order anything complicated periodtoken the people sitting next to us were also frustrated periodtoken   my wife and i were excited to try it periodtoken the place was packed periodtoken there was a sign that said best breakfast in tucson in the front window periodtoken   our server also looked very frustrated periodtoken she barely came by to check on us and ask if we needed anything or wanted a refill because she probably seemed embarrassed periodtoken   the food was brought out and at least it was hot periodtoken the food was good commatoken but not great periodtoken i brought the wait time up to the woman at the counter and she just said yeah commatoken it gets like that periodtoken she gave us a 10 discount though periodtoken   would i come back here nah periodtoken would i recommend no periodtoken","7131":"ordered a chicken caesar wrap periodtoken soon after commatoken my stomach turned into knots periodtoken i became very ill and had to lay in bed the rest of the day periodtoken will not order anything besides a pizza from here again periodtoken i dont trust their cooks when it comes to meat periodtoken also commatoken their phone service is very short and rude periodtoken their delivery drivers however commatoken have always been very pleasant periodtoken   pizza and kind drivers is why i give a 2 star instead of 1 periodtoken","7132":"i stumbled in here yesterday as i was riding my bike to work commatoken wanted a quick bite to eat commatoken and i was famished periodtoken i have rode or driven by here a million times periodtoken its right next to my barber and i frequent seven cups a lot as well commatoken so i thought i would give it a try periodtoken  pj subs is commatoken well periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenleaves much to be desired periodtoken the club sub was edible commatoken though the chopped meats tasted freezer burnt andor old periodtoken the bar area that i ate in was very run down and dirty as if it had not been deep cleaned for a year or two and the stools were beat up could use some refreshing periodtoken i did not expect a lot from this establishment and was not surprised by anything periodtoken however commatoken what really become bothersome and annoying was the constant ringing of a buzzer going off from what sounded like the kitchen area periodtoken on top of this commatoken they let the phone ring and go unanswered several times periodtoken i understand staff may be preoccupied with other tasks commatoken but please just answer the phone and turn off your timers periodtoken no one wants to dine with obnoxious noise distractions as those commatoken even if it is just a sub and beer place periodtoken","7133":"this place was ok commatoken i guess periodtoken  i have definitely had better coffee and the hot chocolate was way too sweet periodtoken","7136":"simply put periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit is not the best korean fried chicken in town periodtoken try wing chix and see the difference periodtoken","7139":"love their soups periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhate their sandwiches periodtoken    i have eaten here twice and both times got the bowl of souphalf a sandwich combo periodtoken  the soups were both fantastic  one was the baked potato soup and the other creamy turkey and rice periodtoken  the sandwiches on the other hand commatoken terrible periodtoken  first time was the turkey artichoke commatoken which was nothing special commatoken but gave me terrible indigestion later periodtoken  second time was the smokehouse turkey periodtoken  the turkey was way too smoked and the ale mustard was so overwhelming that i couldnt taste anything else periodtoken  my husband also got the steak and white cheddar special and didnt like it at all periodtoken  hardly any meat on the baguette and what was on there was dry and crusty periodtoken  pluses are the service is always very fast and the restaurant is clean periodtoken","7146":"loud periodtoken food was underwhelming periodtoken my banana split was not a banana split commatoken and was mostly just chocolate ice cream periodtoken","7150":"great service commatoken disappointing food periodtoken  my husband and i ate here recently on a layover due to the great priority pass deal and while the deal was great  the food wasnt quite so periodtoken  we ordered the meat lovers pizza commatoken the toasted ravioli commatoken and the side salad periodtoken  the toasted ravioli was okay  my husband didnt much enjoy it but i didnt mind it too much periodtoken i did like the marinara that came with it for dipping periodtoken  the salad was unremarkable  a standard salad periodtoken  the pizza was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot good periodtoken the cheese was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni dont even know how to describe it periodtoken it was like a goopy chewy mess periodtoken i liked the meat on the pizza and the pizza sauce commatoken but ugh the cheese periodtoken if you can order it wout the cheese maybe you should periodtoken the crust of the pizza was a thin crust whatever periodtoken maybe a little on the crispy side but honestly not too noteworthy good or bad periodtoken","7152":"when it comes to subways the product is pretty much uniform across locations as long as they keep fresh buns and toppings on hand periodtoken most of the difference i believe is when it comes to staff commatoken customer service commatoken cleanliness commatoken and the location periodtoken  i came in one day for lunch when i was between meetings and in the area periodtoken it was just starting to get busy for lunch so there was a bit of a lineup periodtoken by just starting to get busy i mean there were 2 people that just finished paying and i was next and then 2 people behind me and people were starting to come in behind those people periodtoken so by any means i wouldnt not consider that a huge lineup at all periodtoken  my main reason for giving such a low rating is purely the dysfunctional layout of the store periodtoken as you move down the line towards the till you are herded into the corner where the pop vending machine is and all of the eating utensils and essentials periodtoken so this design pushes people into a tight corner where everyone is in each others way periodtoken it is very uncomfortable to say the least periodtoken it isnt a huge store periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmaybe 20 seats in total perhaps periodtoken there must be a better way to lay things out to better control the flow of customers but it may take a bit of remodelling periodtoken personally this dysfunctional layout would prevent me from coming back periodtoken it is just too awkward and uncomfortable of a location periodtoken hopefully they can remedy this at some point periodtoken if so i may revisit and update my review periodtoken","7154":"the day of our tour it was raining off and on but they didnt cancel which i give props for periodtoken the tour lasted a little over 2 hours and we went to 4 places periodtoken we tried gumbo commatoken jambalaya commatoken a brisket sandwich and a muffuletta periodtoken the food was good commatoken i didnt care much for the jambalaya but every place we stopped at the people from the restaurant seemed like they hadnt gotten a heads up that we were coming periodtoken so every time we stopped wed have to watch the staff scramble around as we waited for tables to be put together and food to be brought out commatoken it was odd periodtoken we lost a few people along the way im not sure if they just left or the guide left without them periodtoken id recommend a different food tour that offers more stops to get a better variety of food periodtoken it was nice to get a tour around the city but its hes to take in the scenery when youre trying to keep up with everyone in the rain periodtoken","7157":"dont get the smaller tavern burger its a different patty that taste like the 49 cents mcdonalds special periodtoken","7159":"sirloin commatoken pulled pork  shrimp was average at best and mashed potatoes had dirt in it periodtoken","7166":"the tacos are definitely good commatoken but overpriced periodtoken its more like a 7 snack than a meal periodtoken ive had them twice and the wait time has been around ten minutes both times periodtoken a food truck should be both convenientfast and affordable commatoken neither of which west coast tacos is periodtoken there seems to be a certain social  novelty hype to the whole ordeal that subconsciously tricks 20somethings into obsessively raving about the place periodtoken   i was very excited about a food truck like this in indy commatoken especially one that utilizes social media to communicate with its customers however the price point and wait time compared to the relative simplicity of the product has left me disappointed periodtoken","7180":"terrible experience periodtoken came for lunch on 212 periodtoken arrived at 1230 periodtoken sat on the patio periodtoken sat at about the same time as two other tables periodtoken sat for about 5 minutes with the last partys dirty dishes on the table periodtoken waitress finally removed the dirty dishes and brought two waters periodtoken didnt come back for another 10 to 15 minutes to take our lunch

commatoken waiting 15 minutes and all it is was a frozen pretzel commatoken not that hard periodtoken after receiving the pretzel and finishing it commatoken waited another 20 minutes for our food periodtoken 20 minutes for a sandwich and a few shrimp which literally requires placing them on a plate periodtoken about 4 tables that were sat around us at the same time or after we did received their food before we did periodtoken i stopped the waitress who kept just walking by and asked what was taking so long periodtoken she so stupidly said commatoken ill go check commatoken not sure whats taking so long periodtoken food still didnt come out for another 10 minutes periodtoken peel and eat shrimp were fine periodtoken they werent for me periodtoken chicken sandwich was disgusting periodtoken so much grease commatoken it poured in my mouth the first and only bite periodtoken the batter was undercooked and just falling off the chicken periodtoken it was as if it was battered too much and just soaked in under temperature oil periodtoken asked the waitress to send over the manager periodtoken this is a key point here periodtoken the manager acted dumber than the waitress periodtoken literally seemed extremely unintelligent periodtoken stuttering and mumbling commatoken uhhh commatoken ummm commatoken not really sure periodtoken at one point he actually said commatoken uhhh commatoken well it is a fried chicken sandwich periodtoken i mean really periodtoken this is your manager this is your best guy on the floor shameful periodtoken after mumbling he said commatoken ill take care of this for you and walked away periodtoken never to return periodtoken we sat there like idiots for the next 10 minutes without  the waitress or manager telling us we didnt have to pay

periodtoken lovely cashiers periodtoken although commatoken they do not dog ice cream periodtoken i took my dog in and they didnt even let her on with me periodtoken i took her through the drive thru and i asked for their best dog ice cream and they started being really rude periodtoken 010 ign would not recommend no quick scoops periodtoken","7190":"food was good but pricey for what you received periodtoken decor was not impressive commatoken and men usually arent that observant periodtoken no soft drinks were available as a drink choice for those who didnt want ice tea or lemonade or something distilled periodtoken parking was abysmal in front only 15 spaces available by the building  not well thought out if someone needs handicap parking periodtoken with louies basque corner next door commatoken that makes for a big lunch crowd all looking for a spot periodtoken one of the members of our group had to park 2 12 blocks away because all the parking areas were full commatoken not a good option for a notsogood neighborhood periodtoken doubtful we will go back periodtoken","7195":"30 mins wait for a simple cup periodtoken needs better working sop periodtoken cant believe that a

atmosphere in amura orlando periodtoken  i have never associated sushi with bad techno commatoken but ru sans doesnt let up periodtoken  we were a group of 6 commatoken and sure enough the service for large groups is indeed bad periodtoken  watch your receipt too  they put the gratuity on it already commatoken even though we all got seperate checks periodtoken  i asked for mine back and changed the total periodtoken  she wasnt that great periodtoken periodtoken  the sushi was really unremarkable commatoken and the wasabi pile was very small periodtoken  i will say that the seaweed salad was delicious commatoken and at least twice the size of the one at amuras commatoken but serving it on a trifold paper towel as some kind of fancy presentation was really tacky periodtoken  i wouldnt go back just because of the terrible music periodtoken  it was all downhill from there periodtoken","7212":"i have never been to such a slow drive thru commatoken and thats comparing to other sss its literally at least a 20 minute wait just to order and thats at 10pm periodtoken although i have gone to their takeout counter and waited just as long for cold food and a melted shake periodtoken not sure why this location cant pull it off like others periodtoken its really disappointing because its right by my house periodtoken","7214":"frozen yogurt places have been popping up all over new orleans periodtoken its becoming an overdone craze and also creates a lot of competition for a good review periodtoken   id say that the yogurt at orange leaf was okay commatoken their flavors werent very exciting and i was escorted through my samplings periodtoken  the server wouldnt just give me tasting cups commatoken she stood by my side and would put the yogurt into the sampling cups that i wanted to try periodtoken  obnoxiously commatoken she would do it one immediately after the other commatoken trying to pass them all into my hands when i was obviously already holding one cup in one hand and my wallet in the other periodtoken  she was impatient and rushing me through so i dont even really understand what i tasted periodtoken  i do know however commatoken that what i tasted was not as good as the frozen yogurt ive had at other places commatoken like yogurtland or plum crazy periodtoken  i think what also annoyed me was that i entered the establishment and waited around inside for about 8 minutes before someone showed up at the front counter periodtoken  i actually thought they had closed commatoken but had forgotten to lock the doors periodtoken  did i also mention that its extremely cold to sit in the store  so summary just okay yogurt commatoken toppings were okay as well commatoken and service was terrible periodtoken  oh wait commatoken almost forgot periodtoken  the yogurt consistency is soft commatoken maybe watery periodtoken  so expect your yogurt to melt and disappear fast after you put some toppings on periodtoken  btw for some toppings commatoken they force you take a certain amount instead of just a little periodtoken","7216":"if it werent for the beer id give this 1 star commatoken good beer commatoken completely awful service periodtoken the bartenders did not offer any education when it came to their beers and seemed like pouring me a beer was a nuisance periodtoken but nothing came close to as bad as the chef in their small kitchen periodtoken when my girlfriend asked how were the nachos he simply replied smugly theyre chips with cheese on them periodtoken he then gave me a beeper and since my party was upstairs i asked how long the wait would be to see if i should just wait downstairs commatoken to which prince charming replied your food is ready when your number goes off periodtoken disappointing experience since i think they have the best beer in stl periodtoken","7224":"excellent food commatoken very good service periodtoken  only two stars because dinner at least is outrageously expensive periodtoken  27 bucks for a lamb stew that was definitely good commatoken but about the size of a bowl of cereal periodtoken  i mean good or not commatoken its still stew periodtoken  the kids moussaka was good as well commatoken but 22 bucks for 1 slice with a small side of khorabi periodtoken  ripoff periodtoken","7225":"i should of listened to the reviews and saved my time and money periodtoken very chaotic and of course the server got my order wrong periodtoken too much of a wait to get it fixed periodtoken","7228":"1 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken   the only good thing about dining here is we got a 90min free parking with validation and their clam chowder periodtoken unfortunately commatoken thats it periodtoken   with all the good reviews commatoken my expectations were high periodtoken it was a hot day and it was lunch time commatoken we didnt mind the long wait under the sun periodtoken but the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive periodtoken there were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list periodtoken not good for the business commatoken definitely not good for waiting customers periodtoken  crab cakes  if i didnt know what they were commatoken i wont be able to guess that they were crab cakes periodtoken just a fishy patty of some sort periodtoken  fried calamariscallopshirmps  they were cooked just right periodtoken could have been perfect if they were not salty periodtoken  rock crab special commatoken served with soup and salad  soup and salad were served first commatoken expecting they were cooking the crab periodtoken after 20 mins commatoken we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it was big at least the top shell periodtoken periodtoken underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size periodtoken the top shell was even clean commatoken meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already periodtoken also commatoken we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served cold periodtoken periodtoken not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge periodtoken thinking we may have placed the order wrong commatoken we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold periodtoken she acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated periodtoken she came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab commatoken im not surprised that its still not warm periodtoken what a waste of money periodtoken   silverwares have heavy water stains commatoken looks very unsanitary periodtoken forks were crooked periodtoken we asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers periodtoken good for them commatoken bad for us periodtoken we will never come back periodtoken","7229":"i purchased a batch of these cookies and some of the cookies contained sayings from someone elses order  various orders periodtoken it made handing out the cookies kind of scary since i never knew what someone would get when they cracked one open one of the sayings commatoken for example commatoken seemed to belong to a bachelorette party periodtoken i contacted the company about four times via both email and telephone with absolutely no response periodtoken","7237":"ok food periodtoken  horrible service periodtoken  we stopped in for a late lunch on a sunday periodtoken  we ordered the dan dan noodles commatoken braised beef noodle soup commatoken sichuan beef noodle soup commatoken doubled cooked pork commatoken and long pepper beef periodtoken  the food was pretty decent but commatoken the service from the host to the wait staff was absolutely dismal periodtoken  it took forever to get seated commatoken and even longer to get anyone to stop by the table and take our order periodtoken  the place was about 25 full so there was no reason why the staff could not pay attention to us periodtoken    forget smile with a service periodtoken  i did really like the long pepper beef and if i want to try it again commatoken i will make sure to get takeout periodtoken","7240":"i appreciate the restaurants mission but the food just wasnt all that good periodtoken   i found tace via google and decided to check it out even though it apparently hadnt been open very long periodtoken it was a wednesday night so we decided not to call ahead to make reservations and it turned out to be a good call periodtoken the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived so we were seated right away periodtoken  the service was prompt commatoken friendly and professional periodtoken i dont recall our waiters name was he was really nice periodtoken he and the hostess took the time to tell us about the restaurants history and the mission behind it all periodtoken turns out tace is a nonprofit organization periodtoken all of the profits go towards a youth organization that is affiliated with taces owners periodtoken   i ordered the new orleans collection which consisted of jambalaya commatoken crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e commatoken fried catfish commatoken red beans blackened red fish  gumbo periodtoken i love cajun food periodtoken being from a food capital commatoken chicago commatoken ive had the privilege of being able to enjoy authentic cajun food like one would find down south periodtoken i have to say that the food i had at tace tasted unlike any cajun food ive ever had in my life periodtoken  the jambalaya and gumbo looked and taste exactly the same periodtoken i actually thought id received two of the same item and had the waiter check with the chef to make sure id received all the right dishes periodtoken i was informed that it was indeed gumbo and jambalaya periodtoken turns out it didnt really matter because i didnt really care for dishes anyway periodtoken   the catfish was good as were the red beans with rice periodtoken i cant really say i was especially impressed with the red fish though periodtoken im not a fan of crawfish etouffee so i didnt eat it periodtoken a friend of mine did and she said she thought it was okay periodtoken  the ambiance was nice so that added to the experience periodtoken the restaurant is nicely decorated with artwork from local artists periodtoken all of the pieces can be purchased as well periodtoken there were also salsa lessons being taught by a staff member while we dined periodtoken dancing isnt my thing but it was fun to watch the others try their hand at it periodtoken   i hate to say it but even with all the good stuff going on at tace the food doesnt warrant my making a return trip or even recommending it periodtoken","7245":"meh commatoken they were really slow commatoken first to seat us more than 5 minutes commatoken and then to bring our food periodtoken that said commatoken however commatoken my chicken strips were tasty and it was more than i expected commatoken as was my root beer float periodtoken","7258":"not 247 periodtoken found that out the hard way at 3a periodtokenm periodtoken  cant wait to try it when its open periodtoken  hopefully the ice cream machine works too periodtoken","7259":"we were looking for somewhere new to eat this evening and i happened to remember seeing the sign for this place opening last week periodtoken we used to enjoy the restaurant that was in this building before five  diner so decided to give this new restaurant a try periodtoken  little commatoken well nothing commatoken has changed about the interior of the place periodtoken its still 1950s kitsch diner although the name and menu would be more appropriate to something country or rustic periodtoken im not sure if the owners just didnt have the money or time to makeover the decor but it certainly is a mismatch periodtoken theyve even kept the 1950s and early 1960s jukebox pop music which seems strange periodtoken   we decided to order from their  all day breakfast menu periodtoken michael chose an omelet with potatoes and english muffin while i chose the buttermilk hoecakes although they are actually pancakes with a side of bacon periodtoken   the food was mediocre periodtoken michaels omelet was barely warm and the cheese he asked for had just been melted over the top then allowed to sit so long it had firmed up again and congealed periodtoken yes commatoken service was slow and undoubtedly that part of the order was sitting in the window periodtoken his potatoes were ok although nothing particularly noteworthy periodtoken   on my end the pancakes were a bit bland periodtoken since i am currently dieting i decided to forgo the syrup and just use a little butter periodtoken while they were not inedible by any means they just didnt seem to be quite worth the hefty 6 periodtoken95 price tag for three pancakes alone periodtoken the bacon commatoken however commatoken was tasty and high quality and prepared just as i had ordered it periodtoken   the people seem genuinely friendly for the most part periodtoken our server was a very nice older lady although i dont think waiting tables is really the career for her periodtoken while pleasant commatoken she was rather inefficient and prone to forgetting simple things periodtoken its also rude of a server to stand over the patron while they are filling out the charge slip and calculating the tip periodtoken   this is one of those restaurants that seems just on the edge periodtoken with a little more attention to the food commatoken some makeover in the decor commatoken and a bit more efficiency in the front of the house and the kitchen it could succeed periodtoken however commatoken without those things im not sure of the longevity of this business periodtoken normally commatoken in our neighborhood a new opening means a fairly full house for at least a few weeks periodtoken when we were there only three other tables were in use and half the dining room was closed periodtoken   well probably try it again in a month or so if theyre still open to see if theyve made any changes or progress periodtoken","7265":"good baked goods but very rude staff i always try and make a trip to the bakery when i am in town from tx periodtoken there are just some things you cant get in austin periodtoken but after the rude service i received today i do not think i will be returning periodtoken i will give my business to haydels and baums fine pastries its worth the trip to br periodtoken","7270":"sadly commatoken feine went downhill fast periodtoken  at first it was such an adorable commatoken pleasant cafe but now it seems like they dont care about the customers experience periodtoken","7274":"thursdays during lent are my burgers days so i decided to stop in to grab a cheeseburger and coffee milkshake periodtoken  the burger was just okay 2 thin commatoken kinda dry patties and 2 cheese slices periodtoken  i was kinda surprised at the size since they claim to be better than five guys periodtoken  well commatoken um periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot quite periodtoken  the housemade chips were the saving grace they were fresh commatoken thickcut commatoken and crispy periodtoken  much better than your lays or herrs periodtoken  my milkshake was just okay it was decent but didnt really stand out periodtoken  i actually would have much rather gone to baskin a few blocks down periodtoken  so commatoken in summation come here for the chips commatoken and get your burger and shakes elsewhere periodtoken","7275":"ate here for the first time today and it will be my last periodtoken ordered a full order of ribs slab with two sides french fries and corn periodtoken total was 29 periodtoken11 thats the most ive ever paid for ribs anywhere including rendezvous and corkys in memphis and any of the amazing places in kc periodtoken   the ribs tasted good but were ridiculously fatty periodtoken i asked for the sauce on the side and was given 1 tiny cup about the size of half a jello shot periodtoken the tiny order of fries had pepper sprinkled on them wtf and i also ordered corn which i thought would be corn on the cob but nooooo periodtoken it was disgusting frozen corn that youd get with your lunch in grade school periodtoken no bread or texas toast or anything else to accompany the meal periodtoken   when i walked in to pick it up the place had no one else in it but cussing bikers periodtoken there is no way i will be back periodtoken not unless every other bbq place in st periodtoken louis closed and theyre the last dump standing periodtoken","7278":"i know the menu just changed to mexican today so i am way ahead of the game here and perhaps thats unfair commatoken but oe market should not serve mexican food periodtoken  there was a ton of hype leading up to the market goes mexican release and yes commatoken i was excited periodtoken but when you really think about it commatoken the mexican vibe does not go with oxford exchange periodtoken they were blaring latin music and have added all sorts of pinatas and our lady of guadalupe candles around the place to make it all mexican periodtoken  you can choose your protein commatoken choose your vehicle aka tortilla or whatever else you want and then choose three toppings periodtoken they do not ask you if you want it for there or to go commatoken so im just assuming they make everything to go periodtoken  i ordered the spicy pork belly taco with ancho sauce commatoken pico de gallo and blistered shishito peppers periodtoken i waited for a little bit to get my taco but it was sort of busy so i didnt really mind periodtoken there is basically no space to sit in the place and the guys in front of me had taken up the entire row so i had to eat outside periodtoken no big deal periodtoken   when i got the taco commatoken i was actually really disappointed periodtoken youll see the picture and notice there is basically no pico de gallo on the taco at all periodtoken the pork belly wasnt even spicy and was mediocre at best periodtoken it had no flavor periodtoken the pepper meh periodtoken the ancho sauce was all over the place and although it tasted good commatoken it was basically the only thing on the taco that i liked periodtoken  this is not oes specialty whatsoever periodtoken the food at their regular restaurant is actually pretty good and i quite liked the sandwich aspect of the market because it truly felt like a market periodtoken their juices are actually pretty good  their almond milk is a good blend and is made fresh periodtoken   the market also has some refrigerated items to take home which looked pretty appetizing periodtoken   but on the whole commatoken this new menu change is a recipe for disaster periodtoken oe will get people going there with the hype commatoken but they wont keep them because these tacos are not good periodtoken head to green lemon on south howard for better quality tacos packed full of flavor periodtoken or go to miguels periodtoken or anywhere else periodtoken   i will go back and try more tacos commatoken unwillingly commatoken but solely for the sake of yelp periodtoken","7279":"i can only comment on the rum raisin commatoken but i was underwhelmed periodtoken the consistency was very thin commatoken and the raisins had an unpleasant commatoken chemical flavor periodtoken i was unable to finish a small periodtoken","7284":"first let me say the two stars is really about reflecting on the dirty plates and silverware i had to weed through on my visit to this place with my 8 friends over the new year break periodtoken i had to go ask the bartender for replacement clean plates for our dirty ones and then watched her sort through the stack in the kitchen for acceptable ones commatoken yikes   having said that commatoken the food tasted ok commatoken wouldnt write home to mom about it commatoken  but the patron margaritas were fab party on garth","7286":"sorry for late review went about 3 weeks ago periodtoken  disappointed periodtoken  ordered two meat platter periodtoken  pulled pork  brisket periodtoken  pulled pork ok commatoken brisket was just like the pulled pork  periodtoken  pulled commatoken i was expecting slices of tender juicy brisket periodtoken  it was a pile of pulled meat periodtoken the sides commatoken  slaw and potato salad have a lot o be desired periodtoken  the corn bread is like a piece of stale cake it was nothing but crumbs periodtoken  sauce good stuff periodtoken","7290":"service was fast periodtoken  theres a full bar periodtoken  my wife had their summertime gimlet based on cumber infused gin periodtoken  very nice commatoken but pricey for a cocktail periodtoken  on tap beers werent that good periodtoken    the prices were high for bbq on a metal platter periodtoken  my wife  i both had bbq sandwiches periodtoken  the rolls were a bit dry and on the small side for the price periodtoken  meat was good commatoken but again the sandwich was smaller than id expected periodtoken  the sweet potato fries were plentiful and tasty periodtoken  my wife didnt care for the cole slaw periodtoken  the beans were good commatoken but skimpy periodtoken  i liked the sweet potato and pecans periodtoken  we split a blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream periodtoken  great ice cream commatoken ok cobbler periodtoken  it was fresh baked and large commatoken but needed some more sweetness periodtoken  the atmosphere was nice periodtoken  downstairs music was just starting up periodtoken  judging by the full parking when we left the place was probably rockin later on periodtoken","7297":"will not eat here again i must admit i have had some very nice meals here in the past periodtoken their basil chicken is very good commatoken tasty and nice bit of spiciness periodtoken last night we ordered basil chicken and kung pao chicken periodtoken could not eat it the kung pao was tasteless and the meat was absolutely horrible periodtoken not one piece of chicken was edible periodtoken grizzle and chewiness in every bite periodtoken basil chicken still tasted good but the chicken was the same as the other dish periodtoken","7304":"the food is pretty darn good but the service is awful periodtoken i work close and have taken my team here many times by of convenience but we continue to get bad service from the time your order until the time you receive your food periodtoken this location closed down for months commatoken but cant tell that they remodeled and they certainly did not train their employees in customer service periodtoken","7306":"i thought over this rating for quite some time commatoken and also ran it by my boyfriend who accompanied me here this morning periodtoken  i was hesitant to rate this at 2 stars especially due to the other reviews that came before me 4 stars commatoken 5 stars commatoken etc which commatoken by the way commatoken was why we came here in the first place rather than going somewhere else periodtoken  im going to start right off the bat with what i and my boyfriend ordered periodtoken  i ordered a cappuccino i have been ordering them everywhere lately so i base my experience on everywhere else in fishtownno libs that offers a cappuccino and my boyfriend ordered his usual plain iced coffee he orders it even in the dead of winter so hes tried an iced coffee all over as well periodtoken  ill get to the point commatoken my cappuccino was eh it tasted burnt and unpure periodtoken  im no coffee connoisseur but i do know a good cup when i taste one and this wasnt it periodtoken  my boyfriend said his iced coffee tasted watered down and unremarkable periodtoken  he ordered an everything bagel with butter and i just opted for a yogurt because thats what i was in the mood for periodtoken  the bagel was also eh and the butter literally tasted like nothing not sure if thats what theyre going for or not but it was unremarkable as well periodtoken  all in all commatoken thats exactly our experience this morning unremarkable periodtoken  i hate leaving reviews like this because i want to give places the benefit of the doubt and maybe we just didnt order a good signature coffee that theyre known for or maybe we should have tried a pastry but i had to go by the rating system and since i went by the rating system commatoken the experience was meh periodtoken ive experienced better periodtoken  the prices are better than other coffee shops in the area but that doesnt mean the quality should lack periodtoken  id rather pay the extra couple of bucks for a really truly good experience periodtoken   and when i talk experience i am not just referring to the food and drink periodtoken  the establishment itself was meh water stains on the ceiling signifying a leak of some sort not something to take lightly and overall the interior decor was just shotty periodtoken  granted commatoken the floor was clean always something i look for commatoken the service was polite but not out of their way friendly commatoken the utensils were clean and there werent any bugs floating in my drink commatoken but at 2 stars as yelps rating states my experience was all around meh periodtoken  sorry reanimator i left your place unanimated and unimpressed periodtoken","7311":"we got the menu at mail and tried the opening sale periodtoken we ordered a lunch special  3 rolls commatoken teriyaki beef commatoken and a fried gyoza periodtoken the teriyaki beef came with a lunchtruck shitty box and it was lacking flavor and sloppy periodtoken the beef was kinda rubbery too periodtoken the sauce seemed like it was squeezed at last instead of mixed well with the dish periodtoken the sushi was bad periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken especially compared with what i usually get from other places periodtoken we found this see pic in the sushi and have zero idea what that is the delivery guy was friendly and on time commatoken i guess thats the only thing we were cool with periodtoken","7316":"so i will say that a few of the things i have had from here have been really good periodtoken  however commatoken my friend who loves this bakery was celebrating a birthday and i ordered his cake from here periodtoken  i had it flat on the floor of my car and live only a short distance from the bakery  before i left the bakery it looked great  when i got home and opened the box the whole top layer of the cake had cracked in half periodtoken  when i called the bakery they offered no assistance in fixing this problem other than to pay for another cake periodtoken i am not sure why this would happen but when i spend a lot of money on a cake it would be nice if it looked presentable periodtoken   so  i would say that while their baked goods may taste yummy if you are looking for reliable customer service  go somewhere else","7317":"not worth the wait commatoken the drink i ordered was watered down probably from the chopped ice that was in the drink periodtoken when seated we were served four waters we dont know why periodtoken decor was excellent commatoken floors need work and the tables were very bland periodtoken when the food came it looked decent commatoken way to much chocolate on the pancakes and hash browns were mediocre periodtoken food was only decent shoneys would have been better periodtoken","7328":"zero benefit to ordering ahead periodtoken you still have to wait in line with everyone else when you get there and my drinks werent even made periodtoken","7329":"im a big fan of dives but this was just dirty looking periodtoken  i didnt even want to touch the doors to enter periodtoken   everything had a nasty layer of greasy scum periodtoken  food was good though periodtoken","7332":"i do not like to give a bad review but it is necessary for improvements periodtoken we got our salads served in very commatokenvery hot bowls straight out of the dishwasher commatoken this is what the waitress claims and then she giggledaubreyreally my salad was wilting faster than i could eat it periodtoken low inventory of dishes periodtoken  i am used to 45 star restaurants that serve salad on a chilled platethis is normal periodtoken my mother was a chef and owned her own place and this would have never left the kitchen  its a training issue periodtoken  i know i should not expect the best in every place i dinebut it does make a difference as to weather i am coming back or not periodtoken i absolutely love salad and expect it chilled and this just did not stand up and make me say wow periodtoken the pizza was tasty and the crust was grilled very nice underneathtoppings were good and the presentation okhad to ask for the pizza shakers though periodtoken what can i say its a bar periodtoken dont order salad commatoken try something else periodtoken","7336":"this review is for breakfast periodtoken i stopped in for a coffee and bagel while waiting for my car at firestone next door periodtoken the bagel was frozen and a little mushy and the coffee was just ok periodtoken they gave me a tiny packet of cream cheese and wanted to charge me  periodtoken50 for another packet commatoken which i thought was crazy after paying 4 for a coffee and reheated frozen bagel periodtoken   the woman working behind the counter was very sweet and we both agreed that the best coffee in town is kaldis just a 2 minute drive from here periodtoken  i wouldnt come back here for an actual meal commatoken but im giving it 2 stars because im happy theres a place for me to sit and have a coffee while waiting for my car","7337":"my waiter was very friendly but thats about as good as it got periodtoken i ordered the signature grilled cheese sandwich which comes with bacon and apple slices periodtoken what i got was two pieces of bread with a slice of cheddar melted on them with apple slices and 2 pieces of bacon thrown between them periodtoken every time i tried to take a bite commatoken  the apples and bacon would slide out from between periodtoken grilled cheese should be a cohesive whole with the bread slices held together by cheese and this was definitely not periodtoken   i then ordered the apple and blueberry crisp periodtoken beyond the fact that it had strawberries and not blueberries commatoken it also was very bland periodtoken the crust was also less a crisp and more just uncooked oatmeal that was warm and soggy periodtoken  my friend s pound cake was also bland periodtoken   they have great ideas in terms of the menu but they could benefit from a head chef who understands the basics of food  construction and spicing periodtoken","7341":"this was the first ethnic restaurant i ate at in tucson many years ago periodtoken i had heard that it was serving kurdish food commatoken and i was excited to try it as i have eaten very delicious kurdish food homemade meals in phoenix periodtoken  kurdish food is actually more gourmet the dishes can be very complicated commatoken and the flavors are complex periodtoken i tried their pillaw a thin puff pastry type shell stuffed with cubes of beef commatoken chicken commatoken rice commatoken and very delicious seasonings periodtoken when i told my friends kurdish in phoenix that i had tried pillaw commatoken they were very jealous commatoken saying they had never made that particular dish periodtoken this was truly a gem of a restaurant 14  years ago periodtoken the most recent time i ate there commatoken pillaw commatoken along with some of the other more ethnic kurdish dishes commatoken had been taken off the menu periodtoken instead commatoken it seemed to be more like a typical middle eastern type restaurant offering mainly gyros for the entree periodtoken another disappointment was the change from authentic kurdish music to heavy rocka type of music played more for the enjoyment of the young servers commatoken it seemed commatoken than for customers seeking something unique or different periodtoken in essence commatoken i wish them well commatoken but it seems they have lost their way periodtoken if they were to go back to their roots commatoken it could be a very delightful restaurant again periodtoken","7343":"we tried cafe fleur de lis on our recent trip to new orleans periodtoken using the factors of atmosphere commatoken taste commatoken and pricing i was quite underwhelmed by this restaurant periodtoken  i ordered the cobb salad for lunch periodtoken it was 13 periodtoken not a crazy price commatoken but high for a salad periodtoken  the base of the salad was your basic bag lettuce you could pick up at any grocery store periodtoken i literally felt like they had cut open a plastic bag of lettuce commatoken and dropped it into my bowl periodtoken then they topped it with standard items periodtoken there was absolutely nothing special about it periodtoken  i always want to have something at a restaurant that i cant easily make on my own at home periodtoken there was not one thing about the preparation of this meal that made it unique in any way periodtoken","7345":"they limit your drinks not only that but bought a jalape\u00f1o mcchicken isnt it suppose to have jalape\u00f1os  my fries were old","7346":"the food was great periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut they ran out of biscuits and corn bread periodtoken the service was horrible periodtoken really slow and the waitress seemed scared periodtoken not sure whats going on today but i am disappointed","7354":"we tried this restaurant after reading the good reviews periodtoken  i now realize they must have been written by the staff periodtoken service was mediocre at best periodtoken staff seemed disorganized and lost periodtoken i dont think there was a manager on duty periodtoken soup of the day  shrimp corn bisque was very good periodtoken happy hour tacos were tasty periodtoken rice on the  other hand was the worst ive ever had commatoken possibly canned periodtoken  wont be back periodtoken","7361":"burger was lame periodtoken  crinkle fries undercooked and tasteless periodtoken  damn good shake though periodtoken  waaay over priced","7364":"i really like this place the burgers are great commatoken a little small but very good periodtoken the beer selection is good and as everyone says the homemade catsup is awesome periodtoken  the big problem here is that is is so damn expensive   12 for a tiny burger commatoken then another 24 for fries dont get me wrong commatoken the food is very good commatoken its just not good enough to justify their prices periodtoken","7365":"let me start out by saying i really want to like this place periodtoken really periodtoken they are in my neighborhood commatoken they have a lovely patio commatoken and serve alttacos periodtoken however commatoken i still cant give them a wholehearted endorsement for a couple of reasons most importantly the disparity between their portions and prices periodtoken im not looking for lardbutt size meals commatoken but when you charge 2 periodtoken50 per taco you expect them to at least be filling periodtoken make them larger commatoken or drop the price periodtoken even a slight drop could reconcile the difference periodtoken and if you charge for chips commatoken they should be good periodtoken really good periodtoken   as for the taste itself commatoken ive found them to be ok periodtoken the issue ive found is that everything is a little bland periodtoken when you say spicy at a mexican even be it altmex you should mean spicy periodtoken the tacos ive tried with a creamy sauce are overwhelmed by the mayolike taste and consistency periodtoken  one thing they are tops at is the speed at lunch cant vouch for dinner commatoken its always too busy for me to bother given my past experiences periodtoken ive got my food within minutes of ordering it periodtoken","7366":"i have dined at baguette deli a handful of times in the past commatoken with my most recent visit being after nearly a year since the previous one periodtoken during prior visits commatoken i had always been pleased with the value and quality of the food commatoken as well as the prices periodtoken unfortunately commatoken it seems the place has changed periodtoken   first commatoken the girl taking my order at the counter seemed hurried and became visibly impatient when i took an extra few moments to decide my order commatoken even though there were only two other customers in the restaurant and no one else in line periodtoken i have always enjoyed the fresh shrimp spring rolls commatoken but was disappointed to find they were out periodtoken in the past commatoken they had been able to make them to order if customers were willing to wait commatoken but when i asked about this commatoken the girl responded with a terse commatoken no commatoken and seemed to take pleasure in being unhelpful periodtoken so i settled on the teriyaki chicken banh mi periodtoken although the bread was crusty and delicious and the veggie toppings were fresh commatoken the chicken was mushy commatoken salty commatoken tasted old commatoken and had the texture of a pur\u00e9e rather than actual meat periodtoken in addition commatoken the meat portion was minuscule commatoken which i was somewhat grateful for in this instance because it simply wouldnt have been palatable periodtoken  while eating my lackluster sandwich commatoken i overheard the conversation between a customer and the girl at the counter periodtoken while placing his order commatoken the customer inquired about the same fresh spring rolls i had been interested in periodtoken the girl told the gentleman they were out commatoken but when he asked about having some made to order commatoken she said yes commatoken after she had given me a flat commatoken unapologetic no periodtoken   despite already being furious commatoken my next commatoken and possibly most significant issue with baguette deli commatoken is that they no longer offer free water to customers commatoken which i am reading is a complaint i share with other reviewers periodtoken instead of a pitcher of water with reusable plastic cups that diners could help themselves from commatoken the restaurant now requires patrons to purchase an overpriced bottle of water periodtoken i find this practice cheap commatoken greedy commatoken and in the worst possible taste and service periodtoken despite relatively reasonable base prices and good experiences in the past commatoken the new nickeling and diming tactics commatoken inconsistency commatoken and poor customer service has made baguette deli a place i no longer wish to give my patronage to periodtoken","7368":"the guy was great commatoken he was a good server

a bunch of long lines to a bunch of lunch trucks periodtoken i got there late commatoken thinking it goes until 10 and my friends inform me that if the food hasnt run out commatoken then itll be an hour wait for me periodtoken no thanks periodtoken   it had a lot of potential to be cool commatoken there was music and i saw a lot of people i knew periodtoken but there was nothing to do but stand

periodtoken","7435":"below average pricey thai restaurant with a full vegan menu periodtoken    visited on 12217 at 5pm periodtoken  i must have passed by this place a hundred times and never noticed it which is ludicrous because the sign on the outside of the building is absolutely enormous and they have a unique round entryway around the front door periodtoken it sits in a small strip mall next

chicken pineapple fried rice which came with apple juice and a spring roll periodtoken  i do not like paying ten dollars for a kids meal at any restaurant but i will say their portion was enormous periodtoken  they give 34 times more than any child can possibly eat periodtoken  it was the best thing i tried tonight periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhot and fresh and well seasoned periodtoken i found it unusual that it was smothered with fried onions which i wouldnt think is very kid friendly periodtoken  my advice would be to cut the portion in half and lower that price and nix the onions periodtoken   also the meal was supposed to come with a dessert which they never brought out periodtoken   i watched in horror as my husbands dish arrived periodtoken  he had the 20 periodtoken95 seafood basil delight which the menu said had shrimp commatoken calamari commatoken mussels commatoken and scallops stir fried with basil and onions and an herbal sauce periodtoken  what arrived was a

feeling hungry   the chicken parm had a good sauce periodtoken the chicken was tasty commatoken but it looked of rather low quality think 1999 mcdonalds chicken mcnugget periodtoken the gyro was overfilled with the sauce  it was dripping everywhere periodtoken and the chicken that was used on that similarly looked  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken fake periodtoken it tasted okay commatoken but within 30 minutes i did not feel periodtoken  i see why this place has such high reviews  food tastes good least the chicken parm did and my order was ready within 15 minutes  impressive periodtoken but the food quality commatoken in my opinion commatoken is really poor periodtoken  i will not return periodtoken","7447":"woohoo first review sadly commatoken this will be a review for the crappiest place i ate at in reno periodtoken  i wasnt expecting much from a casino commatoken but somehow my hopes went up when i saw that the two chefs in the asian part of the restaurant were actually periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenasian there is a wide selection of dishes that actually cant be found at any other chinese fast food place periodtoken props for that periodtoken the whole restaurant itself also has american food and i believe mexican commatoken but i dont quite remember periodtoken  anyway commatoken back to the food periodtoken all of the ingredients are already prepared and are out for the chefs to use commatoken sort of like at subway periodtoken one guy puts it all together commatoken and the other cooks it periodtoken i ordered the cashew  almond chicken commatoken which also had some vegetables with it and came with some rice periodtoken the first chef put everything together and gave it to another guy to cook periodtoken however commatoken he threw it in the wok commatoken let it warm up for 30 seconds commatoken and thew it on the plate periodtoken i was expecting some actual cooking periodtoken maybe some soy sauce garlic any spices nope commatoken nothing periodtoken  after trying the dish commatoken i almost didnt want to eat it anymore commatoken but i had no choice periodtoken the nuts were plentiful commatoken which i enjoyed thats what she said periodtoken however commatoken the whole dish was just ridiculously bland and tasteless periodtoken there actually wasnt that much chicken and the vegetables consisted a large portion of the dish periodtoken  a cheap place on the bottom floor of a reno casino periodtoken i didnt expect much in the first place commatoken but any restaurant can do better commatoken especially this one periodtoken","7453":"generally im a fan of produce junction periodtoken the concept of fresh produce for less is a no brainer periodtoken even if i have to buy 20 bananas periodtoken for 2 commatoken ill buy them and give half away periodtoken its still much cheaper and better quality than what id get at acme periodtoken   but this location has issues periodtoken it has a cramped parking lot commatoken that is overflowing at peak times periodtoken but most distressing commatoken a lot of the produce youll find here is past its prime commatoken or worse commatoken spoiled or moldy periodtoken since much is prebagged commatoken youll often only find this out when you reach home and unpack your purchases periodtoken   if you are going to shop here commatoken check everything closely before you leave its a hassle to return and they seem to have no procedure in place for dealing with returns and complaints periodtoken and do follow the math as the attendant adds up your purchases periodtoken they are often wrong commatoken usually overcharging periodtoken  cash only","7455":"i really wanted to love this place but i dont   im giving them two stars because i

eat these things  our server linda commatoken was a gem commatoken she was friendly commatoken helpful and knew how to guide us through the menu as this was our first visit periodtoken five big shiny stars for her service the food however was a different story periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   hubby started with a bowl of clam chowder commatoken which was loaded with potatoes and tender clams commatoken but nothing else commatoken the consistency was good commatoken however it really lacked in flavor commatoken it needed so much more commatoken perhaps onions commatoken celery commatoken i stirred in one pat of butter  paula deen approved  a little salt and pepper and that still did not do the trick commatoken so i repeated this same procedure commatoken but it really did not help periodtoken  philadelphia is known for snapper soup commatoken but this tasted sour commatoken the meat was tender and plentiful and a poor quality sherry was served on the side periodtoken we each took one bite and decided we would pass periodtoken the crab imperial stuffed mushroom caps were okay commatoken but expensive commatoken four small mushroom caps and i do mean small were filled with the imperial for ten dollars periodtoken  my two pounds of garlic crabs were all work and no play commatoken but plenty of messing around trying to get out the minimal amount of meat commatoken i was tempted to pick up those babies and start sucking the meat out of them no more blue crabs for me commatoken ill stick with the dungeness commatoken snow or alaskan crabs from now on commatoken better yet commatoken saute me some pure lump crab meat in a little garlic and butter periodtoken i will give them this the garlic and red pepper sauce was outstanding commatoken they should bottle it periodtoken  hubby had the seafood imperial with crab commatoken scallops and bay shrimp commatoken which was a very rich but small portion and we both agreed it not only smelled very fishy commatoken but tasted fishy as well commatoken after two or three bites we decided to bring it home for the cat commatoken but she was not thrilled enough to eat it either periodtoken  they have a full bar and a happy hour commatoken my margarita was not very good commatoken mostly bottled margarita mix periodtoken the hostess was not very friendly commatoken well she was okay with us commatoken but i had to giggle when two young girls moved from a table to a booth and she screamed at them  you can not just seat yourselves  i did not see what the big deal was commatoken they were not very busy commatoken however with them pushing together many tables throughout our meal commatoken it was obvious they were planning on some large parties arriving soon periodtoken  all in all commatoken linda rocks commatoken what a sweetheart commatoken the place is a little worn down from wear and tear commatoken the food is below average in my opinion for the prices they charge periodtoken","7458":"i thought the wings were small commatoken like wings you get from the italian market periodtoken reflecting on it commatoken they probably were the size a normal chicken wing should be periodtoken im just use to chicken with hormones that are twice the size periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the macaroni and cheese lacked flavor periodtoken  the yams tasted like they came from a can

ive ever had periodtoken it was like eating a ball of flour mixed with some noodles periodtoken the mashed potatoes were just what it says periodtoken mashed potatoes periodtoken the collard greens were loaded with vinegar commatoken which might work for some but not me periodtoken it also had slices of garlic commatoken which for me made me tentative on biting into a slice and getting blown away with it periodtoken the bradford was decent as the pork had a nice smoke flavor commatoken but the chicken was dry and couldve used more sauce or jalape\u00f1o periodtoken unfortunately i cant give it another chance periodtoken definitely prefer some bbq down on the boulevard like mission or famous daves periodtoken","7466":"my love hate relationship with whole foods goes on periodtoken

periodtoken it seems like every time i go there they are out of one or more flavor commatoken and the employees are pretty slow to refill them periodtoken also commatoken their fruit selection is awesome commatoken when its available commatoken and once again it seems to be hard to keep it stocked commatoken as they are out of at least one type of berry every time commatoken and there isnt a sense of urgency to refill them periodtoken i will say that the employees have been very cordial and nice at this location commatoken but just not very helpful periodtoken frozen yogurt has been stellar though commatoken and i love the cookie dough and the hot fudge periodtoken hopefully the upkeep on the flavors and the toppings can be improved commatoken as this would significantly bring up the rating periodtoken","7472":"this foodery is dingier than the 2nd street location commatoken but closer to restaurants in cc easier to stop by before going to restaurants periodtoken due to the limited space commatoken it can get really crowded in the store commatoken so if youre claustrophobic commatoken avoid it periodtoken but my general feelings towards the establishment do not change from the 2nd street location to this one periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthat is commatoken the place is just too damn expensive periodtoken you can easily pay average bar price for bottled beer without the bartender periodtoken they have really cute cats hanging out in the store commatoken so thats a little better than a real bar commatoken i guess periodtoken","7473":"i almost fell off my chair reading the reviews for this store periodtoken gone down hill since raleys bought it the store is dirty and disorganized apparently these folks were never in here before raleys bought it periodtoken it has never been clean or organized periodtoken these types of stores cater to a specific clientele and minimal staff and stock help keep prices down periodtoken if you walk in here expecting raleys you will definitely be disppointed periodtoken it does have pretty good prices and selection on produce which is about as far as i venture in any more periodtoken","7474":"the food was great periodtoken i had the fried green tomatoes loved the sauce and a burger periodtoken my requested mw looked more welldone commatoken but it still tasted good periodtoken my problem was with

what we have new commatoken you should try it basic restaurant conversation we got none periodtoken i would have asked for a new beer if it didnt take having to reach over the counter just to flag down the bartender in order to order our pizza for which we got charged 1 periodtoken99 for swapping a meat that we do at other locations with no charge periodtoken pizza was lacking toppings too periodtoken i would suggest yall get on the same page for every location periodtoken i dont mind paying extra for ranch when its homemade like other locations but not a fan when its from a jar

considering its location commatoken i do fault it for the extremely negative attitude of its employees periodtoken none of them make even a minimal effort to hide their annoyance at the mere presence of paying customers periodtoken they act as though you are ruining their day by politely ordering food and paying for it periodtoken the only reason i gave two stars instead of one is because the nuggets and fries were decently fresh periodtoken   i understand that working at mcdonalds in a place like that is probably nobodys dream job commatoken but if you cant have an positive attitude in

periodtoken i can see why periodtoken the produce department is pretty good i have to say and the guys how run it do a decent job of keeping it stocked and clean periodtoken frozen foods could use some help  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i couldnt even get a simple bag of carrots  peas periodtoken  overall the store needs a good deep cleaning and is really too small to service their

periodtoken periodtoken i would prefer to have a 1 stop shop and for that reason i generally go to costco if im going to have to get in my car in the first place periodtoken","7512":"it just seems

commatoken a round one up by the bar commatoken and you would have thought wed asked her for a kidney periodtoken   she seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved periodtoken    our group ordered appetizers commatoken which were good periodtoken  nothing spectacular though periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyummy cheese and mustard sauces for the commatoken obviously commatoken frozen pretzels periodtoken  the salsa was okay commatoken chips commatoken meh periodtoken  hands down commatoken chilis has the best chips around periodtoken   several of our party tried the beer flights commatoken which they really enjoyed periodtoken     this is the first time weve ever eaten inside commatoken and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time commatoken but they brought bottles of cold water commatoken about the size of a wine bottle commatoken to your table commatoken where water glasses already sat periodtoken   they kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal periodtoken  a cute concept but had to keep asking for ice they brought one glass commatoken to be shared with the table periodtoken  like i said commatoken cute concept commatoken but again commatoken i personally prefer ice water and dont want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal periodtoken    the food periodtoken  ahhh commatoken where to begin    i had a cup of their beer cheese soup commatoken which commatoken was tasty commatoken but it just seemed to be lacking something periodtoken   which commatoken honestly commatoken pretty much sums up everything there periodtoken   i ordered the southwest black bean burger with a side of fries fries commatoken at the recommendation of our server commatoken over the whitecheddar mashed potatoes periodtoken    this was truly one of the most blah burgers i have ever eaten periodtoken  if i had not asked for onion on it commatoken i dont think it would have had any taste periodtoken  the guacamole cr\u00e8me on the burger had no taste commatoken at all periodtoken   i think it was just pureed avocado commatoken with nothing else added periodtoken   another thing commatoken and this is just my personal

i only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest periodtoken  the fries were completely nondescript mcdonalds fries are a 1 commatoken000 times better periodtoken  my boyfriend ordered their redeye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare it was served welldone with so much extras glopped on commatoken he had to eat it with a fork periodtoken  he commatoken however commatoken got some fancy ketchup for his fries commatoken which i did not periodtoken   the fancy ketchup still couldnt disguise the fact that the fries were so blah periodtoken  overall commatoken a very lacking

came to almost 13 periodtoken00 periodtoken  they were shutting down the restaurant while i waited periodtoken  when the pizza was done commatoken the box they handed me was the size of a cd well not that small but pretty small periodtoken  see the picture ive attached with the pizza next to a remote periodtoken  for 13 periodtoken00 i expected their small would be larger than 9 periodtoken  the pizza itself was ok periodtoken  i got the neapolitan crust which was pretty good periodtoken  the sauce was very tangy and was more like a spaghetti marinara than a pizza sauce commatoken although not bad periodtoken  there was a lot of cheese but it wasnt sliced very well so the whole pizza fell apart when trying to take a slice periodtoken  overall commatoken the pizza just didnt seem put together very well periodtoken  it kind of tasted like a pizza you might try to make at home with ingredients from winn dixie periodtoken  the menu is pretty large and has a lot of items other than pizza periodtoken  im not sure if i will try this place again periodtoken  i will update the review if i do periodtoken","7520":"same experience every time i go there periodtoken foods totally fine

felt like a tourist only restaurant periodtoken   wait staff was average periodtoken   the outdoor seating was nice periodtoken","7569":"sorry commatoken but that this tour is by a company named best tours is an oxymoron periodtoken  the only reason i gave two stars is that we were introduced to two wonderful bakeries commatoken and we had a living social deal so i dont feel as ripped off as i would have had i paid full price periodtoken  otherwise commatoken this was a total bust periodtoken  in one hour some people felt it was supposed to be 2 hours we covered 2 miles and while the first two places were very nice commatoken the third and fourth were not periodtoken  the last place commatoken scoop deville commatoken is a wellknown ice cream restaurant and our cupcakes were clearly frozen and very dried out periodtoken  the tour guide practically ran the very large group from place to place and provided little to no information about philadelphia commatoken which i kind of thought was supposed to be part of the experience periodtoken  if you go commatoken dont expect to leave full periodtoken  we had 12 cookie commatoken one mini cupcake commatoken and 13 of a cupcake

is sad because i truly do want to support the local business periodtoken","7583":"as others have said commatoken the pizza had parts that were burnt char on the bottom periodtoken maybe this

and it tasted good commatoken though expensive periodtoken my fiance loves ice cream cake commatoken so for his birthday commatoken i ordered an ice cream cake to be delivered literally next door periodtoken periodtoken like 8 feet away commatoken and it didnt happen periodtoken  i spoke with the owner earlier in the week and he was super friendly and eager to have a cake made and was the one to suggest that it could be delivered since i mentioned he worked right next door periodtoken i asked if i could pay over the phone so i didnt have to make a separate trip to the store commatoken but was told they would incur fees if they did that and that i should come in person commatoken even if it was after the time of delivery periodtoken it was a bit annoying to have to make a separate trip commatoken but i was happy that they seemed to be flexible if i couldnt make it there before today periodtoken  i happened to be able to get to the store on wednesday to place the order and i was there for a quite a while periodtoken there was only one person there commatoken and while she was very friendly commatoken she seemed pretty flustered having to deal with placing my order and handling other customers as they came in periodtoken she didnt really know much about the cake options and had me speak to their manager on her cell phone to answer my questions periodtoken really commatoken not a big deal commatoken but i had assumed that employees would know the basics about how many servings were in a cake commatoken what flavors we could do commatoken etc periodtoken while expensive 35 i went for the regular size periodtoken once we finally established the order commatoken the cash registers all temporarily crashed and were denying peoples cards periodtoken we finally got it ordered and paid for and again commatoken a delivery time of 1215 was confirmed periodtoken his name was taken and my phone number was taken in case there were any issues periodtoken i specified what time it had to be delivered because it is when my fiance is on his break and would have to go back into a classroom to teach and the cake would just turn into a melty mess if it had to sit there periodtoken   when i hadnt heard from him commatoken i called the store to see if it had been delivered periodtoken i called three times in about 20 minutes and no one answered the phone commatoken so i called my fiance and while not wanting to ruin the surprise commatoken had to ask if it had arrived it hadnt periodtoken one of his coworkers went next door to check on it and it was still sitting there periodtoken the person working eventually ended up calling me and saying that she couldnt leave the store since she was the only one there commatoken but that someone came and picked it up after i called him and told him to check on it periodtoken on top of it commatoken im told that it didnt even taste very good periodtoken    as an edit to my original review as soon as the owner found out that there was a problem commatoken he called to try and right the situation in any way possible periodtoken he didnt try to make excuses for why it happened commatoken but apologized that we had a negative experience with the store periodtoken through the whole process commatoken he has been very friendly and professional and i appreciate him reaching out to see what they could do to fix it periodtoken  i understand these things do happen occasionally and it says a lot when a business owner actively takes steps to make the situation better periodtoken  like i said originally commatoken the yogurt is good and i appreciate the efforts commatoken so i will be giving them another chance periodtoken","7596":"this was our second time here and i left thinking again the food is just very ordinary periodtoken  i had a cesar salad which had no taste and then follow that with a predue chicken rosemary so very bland periodtoken the hostess and wait staff were just fine but the food was just ok not really worth coming back for periodtoken","7597":"unfortunately commatoken i was rather let down food was mediocre at best commatoken service was deplorable

believer that you get what you pay for periodtoken not alot of toppings which doesnt make the pizza filling commatoken too much sweet sauce in my opinion  the dough  was extremely  hard  tough at the

favour of the soup didnt have enough time to penetrate the noodle commatoken so it tasted like noodleandsoup commatoken not noodle soup periodtoken  if you go down the block to visit zwei and have their chilli beef noodle soup commatoken youll know what i am talking about periodtoken  we also had the scallion pancake commatoken but it was bit overfried commatoken so we could taste the bitterness periodtoken  the string bean dish is the only dish that is still up to par periodtoken  as for atmosphere commatoken the restaurant needs a serious rework periodtoken  the restaurant is dark and gloomy commatoken but the decor wasnt going to the trendy theme periodtoken  the benches all have holes on them periodtoken  the feel of the restaurant is that its cheap and rundown

periodtoken we had to come back in and ask for the box commatoken which was the whole point of getting that pretty expensive special commatoken the girl gave us a why do you need it look and gave us

been about three months since ive been there commatoken but for the most part the coffee was burnt commatoken and their iced coffee was more like dirty water periodtoken dont go out of your way to triple brew it or anything periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken their boba bubble tea is okay until you get to the boba itself commatoken which is generally hard in the middle periodtoken this place has a really cool vibe commatoken but i think it gets 5 stars because its a bit ritsy compared to most coffee shops commatoken and folks in eagle are definitely fans of the fancy periodtoken all in all commatoken if youre in eagle and want a place to sit commatoken browse the websocialize its a great place commatoken but if youre jonesin for a good cup of the dark

beer commatoken because that seems to be the case periodtoken the beer wasnt awful commatoken but everything was very safe commatoken and a lot of it just wasnt very good periodtoken i was impressed that they did nitrocask pours commatoken but they were served cold periodtoken i was told later commatoken by a local bartender who also spoke highly of this place commatoken that their beer is

conclusion  the wine is cheap and i was not impressed with the quality periodtoken if you are having a large tasting commatoken pull your best wines out periodtoken the atmosphere and concept of the place is cool periodtoken go here if you are a poor college student  alcoholic  need bulk wine periodtoken if you want a much better bottle of wine for 20 commatoken go up the street to the wine depot on grant  alvernon commatoken they have wine tastings for 5 on friday periodtoken","7895":"im totally disappointed from tony lukes here periodtoken my cheesesteak had no seasoning at all periodtoken its like they just took the meat and threw it on the thick bread periodtoken wasnt any flavor at all periodtoken i tried to add my own salt and pepper and it still didnt do anything periodtoken the only reason im giving them two stars because the french fries are awesome periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken other than that periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this place stinks   d in my book","7899":"tried this place with a guy from work while on a business trip in philly periodtoken i love pizza commatoken but ive decided im not really into the trendyupscale pizza places like this periodtoken to be fair commatoken when i found this place online i didnt know that it was this style of pizza place or else i would not have checked it out periodtoken we have places like this where i live in california and its just not my thing periodtoken i will give it to them that their restaurant is a cool spot periodtoken i really liked the outdoor patio periodtoken it was also cool how one of the regulars that we were sitting next to gave us the clue to use a code word with the waiter and when i did i was told that they had 3 pies that were 12 price with mentioning that word periodtoken my friend and i both picked one of those pizzas periodtoken i ordered the broccoli pizza and didnt care for it at all because they broccoli had a strange chemicallike taste periodtoken once i took the broccoli off commatoken it was decent commatoken but still not amazing periodtoken my friend ordered a different type commatoken which i tried and i will say his was better commatoken but still not my favorite periodtoken overall commatoken some people may be into this place commatoken so still give it a shot periodtoken","7901":"dunno what all the fuss is about periodtoken  i had high hopes based on the great reviews here periodtoken  so commatoken tonight we went to check it out periodtoken  as soon as we pulled up and saw the sign in the window commatoken my friend said commatoken oh  chef scott periodtoken  do you know him i asked periodtoken  only from the farmers market periodtoken  once we were inside commatoken he told me that chef scott sold him that lasagna that he took home and cooked later that was only soso periodtoken  i wish he had spoken up earlier  we ate ours in the restaurant periodtoken  there is virtually no ambience commatoken no art on the wall even periodtoken  if the food had been really good i would have overlooked that periodtoken  but it wasnt periodtoken  the food is completely underwhelming periodtoken  blah and meh come to mind  i can cook better lasagna and manicotti than chef scott commatoken and i am no chef  just an experienced home cook periodtoken the two stars are for the clean restaurant and the friendly counter girl periodtoken    dont waste your time or money periodtoken  pass up this one periodtoken","7902":"hoped this would be as good as the one in bloomington periodtoken not periodtoken nice try periodtoken i suppose people go for the beer periodtoken","7909":"i am not sure what the gourmet in the pizza is other than the somewhat unusual combos thrown together a bit like leftover moussaka periodtoken the thai pizza is incredibly sweet and tangy and thankfully commatoken offset by the chewy bread periodtoken the shrimp pizza is unusual without being special periodtoken the chevre is a total waste of money periodtoken the problem with the joint is that the pizza ingredients are thirdrate theres no point saying this is organic that is local or this was grown by 5year olds learning naturelove im exaggerating commatoken but you get the spiel if none of the stuff is flavorful or adds to the overall taste of the pizza periodtoken the pizzas i ordered had terrible sundried tomatoes the tang shook my molars like a bolt from the blue the garlic in the pizza is in the form of large hemispheres  who in their right minds wants to chew hemispheres of baked garlic and finally commatoken the sauce  omg commatoken the sauce  as someone else said commatoken is so bland except the thai pizza where the sauce is like an eye poke that youre weeping for the joy of gluten and tasteless carbohydrates periodtoken  if i eat gourmet pizza commatoken i expect the thing to be commatoken at the very least commatoken memorably tasty since i am stuffing into my body things that are not good for me periodtoken sigh very disappointed periodtoken   bmp  is someone reading this please do something to your menu   1 star for affordable prices another for reasonably good service periodtoken nothing for food periodtoken","7910":"nothing extraordinary periodtoken i ordered pancakes with blueberries and pecans commatoken along with poached eggs and bacon periodtoken the three pancakes we very fluffy and light and had no blueberries or nuts inside periodtoken what i got was two little cups of super sweet blueberry compote and nuts periodtoken the cracker barrels pancakes are better periodtoken disappointing periodtoken","7913":"the ambience is cool commatoken but the wait staff wasnt knowledgeable about the menu commatoken and the food was below expectations and over priced periodtoken seriously commatoken mcdonalds would have been a better choice for breakfast periodtoken","7916":"they can take the reservation periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey just cant keep the reservation periodtoken  we had reservations dec 29 for 7pm and were seated at 735pm periodtoken  when i followed up with the hostess at 720 she said well we cant go around encouraging people to leave periodtoken  i didnt appreciate the flippant response  but she was young so im guessing she hasnt had much experience andor training on customer relations periodtoken  and i certainly dont expect a restaurant to do something like that commatoken but what i do expect is a restaurant to know how many reservations they can take at one time and to save tables periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenjust some basic restaurant management periodtoken  to make matters worse commatoken my entr\u00e9e ribs were blackburnt and tough periodtoken  i had them once before and they were very good periodtoken  perhaps they had an off night with less seasoned employees running the show","7921":"i tried the rock crab  sorry to say i was very disappointed  i couldnt taste the natural flavor of the sea commatoken very bland and very dry periodtoken  i had better boiled crabs from safeway periodtoken  i did enjoy the new england clam chowder periodtoken  yummy  servers were great","7924":"was heading to the bar  grill on the opposite corner but saw this place and thought it was interesting on the outside and would try it periodtoken  seating is one big long table on the main floor so if its busy commatoken hopefully you like your neighbor periodtoken   liked the atmosphere periodtoken  milking cans as lights and old windows separating the kitchen area from the rest of the restaurant periodtoken looked like there was additional table seating on the second floor periodtoken i had the fig salad and it was good although a bit too much salad dressing once i got to the bottom of the bowl periodtoken  my fault for not remembering to ask for dressing on side periodtoken burgers were small round wise but fatthick so although we asked for medium commatoken the middle was very pink periodtoken wasnt quite raw but pretty close periodtoken   the pretzel bites wbeer cheese would have been better with some salt on them periodtoken fries were very good periodtoken ketchup is not your normal ketchup commatoken it has something else in it periodtoken service was fine but would have been better if she smiled a bit periodtoken  would i try it again if i was in the area commatoken probably periodtoken  its different than what we are used to periodtoken","7927":"contrary to what some reviewers have written i found our tour guide preston to be an awful representative for this business periodtoken he was difficult to understand because of his speech patterns and chronic mumbling commatoken and he didnt seem to care that most of us could neither understand or even hear him we were a group of 15 periodtoken  preston rambles on a lot  including his personal stories  but came up short on the historic information we came to learn periodtoken   our tour ended 30 minutes early  at 5 commatoken not 530  and apparently we were supposed to go somewhere for bread pudding according to other reviewers but preston eliminated that periodtoken when asked why were were done early he simply said go enjoy your friday night commatoken no mention of cutting out one of our taste samples periodtoken   i wish we had the other tour guide bob commatoken he seemed much more concerned with giving a great tour periodtoken","7934":"this review is for the cheesecake alone periodtoken   okay so maybe i got a bad batch or something but it was not as amazing as everyone raves it to be periodtoken i actually thought it had a pretty strange bitter taste afterwards periodtoken  i love cheesecake commatoken so i was pretty excited to bring it to this potluck that i was invited to that evening periodtoken  i told everyone to try a piece bc it was said to be the best cheesecake ever periodtoken instead of being proud of the cheesecake commatoken i was slightly embarrassed when most people said the taste was off and thought it was just opposite of best periodtoken  ill give it another try  most likely when someone else purchases the cake bc i wouldnt want another one to go to waste on my buy periodtoken","7943":"hmm periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenpassed by for the first time and decided to stop in periodtoken  the space is cute and looks like a great place to hang out commatoken but the overall experience was not great periodtoken   ordered the oolong milk foam tea commatoken but they didnt have any milk foam even in the early afternoon periodtoken  the staff didnt mention that they would be making anymore either periodtoken    instead commatoken i had to order a regular oolong milk tea and also 2 grapefruit fresh teas for my family periodtoken  there were maybe two people in line in front of me commatoken but my order took 20 minutes periodtoken  some of the staff seemed to be working hard while others were constantly checking their cell phone periodtoken  when i finally arrived at my car commatoken i tried the oolong milk tea and it was literally just milk lactaid or milk powder with tapioca periodtoken  there was no tea taste at all periodtoken  the color of my drink was white periodtoken  the grapefruit juices were just ok at all periodtoken  it was also inconvenient that they didnt offer a bag or tray until i asked since i had 3 large drinks to carry out periodtoken  overall commatoken the place is unorganized and definitely has room for improvement periodtoken  with so much competition nearby commatoken i hope they can improve since the space is great periodtoken","7946":"this was one of my boyfriends favorite places to get breakfast periodtoken it obviously is nothing fancy commatoken and thats the appeal periodtoken they usher patrons in and out quickly commatoken and your coffee is never empty periodtoken the service is quick and efficient they are friendly but dont waste time with pleasantries periodtoken we always order the fouritem breakfast periodtoken when we first started coming commatoken it was under 4 periodtoken we could get out the door with a decent breakfast for both of us for about 10 commatoken including tip periodtoken the prices have increased significantly periodtoken this last visit commatoken the bill was 16 periodtoken that doesnt break our bank commatoken but we also observed the service was quite a bit slower commatoken and our food was very greasy compared to previous visits periodtoken we wont return periodtoken","7947":"i was going to give it one star but decided 2 stars is fine periodtoken for the most part i get what i ordered commatoken except when i dont but ive already paid for it and have been waiting for 10 minutes only to find out they dont have the thing i wanted periodtoken   i find it is not bad going through the drive through but inside you will be waiting a minimum of 5 minutes for any beverage periodtoken just one beverage periodtoken this isnt all staff it is 2 in particular periodtoken i hate to speak ill of anyone in particular so all i will say is if you are in no rush and like to talk this is the time for you periodtoken if you want coffee in a reasonable time at all dont come here commatoken especially if you are getting more than coffee periodtoken  this is a full tims hortons shared with the esso periodtoken the esso is fast and efficient periodtoken just not the tims periodtoken","7949":"heard so many awesome things about this place and came with some pretty high expectations periodtoken got there about 15 minutes before lunch started commatoken my bad commatoken so went outside to wait til it started periodtoken i didnt understand why they couldnt take our order and wait until 11 to put it in that way we didnt walk back and forth commatoken but not every restaurant thinks of these things periodtoken was very disappointed commatoken stood next to the register to give my order and when someone finally came to take it commatoken he was obviously not trained to take an order periodtoken he kept fumbling with the register and had to ask someone where something was periodtoken why wasnt there a proper trainer on hand crazy periodtoken i ordered two pepperoni pizzas and a grilled cheese commatoken there were 3 of us periodtoken we took our number and sat outside periodtoken the atmosphere gets one of the stars commatoken and the grilled cheese got the other one periodtoken both pizzas were completely black on the bottom periodtoken ridiculous i didnt have time to get it fixed commatoken because of my silliness in coming 15 minutes early commatoken so we ate the toppings and left periodtoken service was lacking commatoken food was mediocre at best and definitely would not recommend","7951":"i typically only write yelp reviews when the experience is something to warned about commatoken so consider this a warning periodtoken  my boyfriend commatoken his brother and i tried out in riva last night periodtoken as a precursor commatoken the restaurant was not terribly busy commatoken so the issues we had were not a result of an overtaxed staff or kitchen periodtoken  if our first mistake was choosing in riva to have dinner commatoken our second mistake was deciding to sit at the bar periodtoken  we sat down at the bar and waited commatoken and waited commatoken and waited until the bartender finally acknowledged out presence with a halfhearted apology about making us wait periodtoken  all three of us ordered both appetizers and entrees periodtoken  while it was obvious that were were all dining together commatoken the kitchen decided that we should all get our food at different times periodtoken  my boyfriend ordered the pea soup commatoken which came out first periodtoken  about five minutes later his brothers octopus arrived commatoken and yet another five minutes later my meatballs finally arrived periodtoken  my boyfriend and his brother were both finished with their appetizers before mine arrived at the bar periodtoken  this ritual of staggering dishes and service was repeated when our entrees came out  again my boyfriends ravioli arrived first commatoken his brothers rigatoni followed several minutes later and my pizza arrived last and when the pastas were nearly completely consumed periodtoken  this kind of service is unacceptable as it makes the dining experience awkward for all the members of the party periodtoken  however commatoken no one at in riva found this to be at all problematic commatoken and it seemed to par for the course periodtoken    the food in and of itself was good commatoken however commatoken it was nothing extraordinary and was way overpriced periodtoken  while the prices themselves were not terrible commatoken the portions for the appetizers and the entrees were small 10 for three meatballs and 12 for three vegetable ravioli  lastly commatoken the service from the bartender was the worst service i have had in a  long time periodtoken  not only were we sitting at the bar for a while before she greeted us or took even a drink order commatoken she also specialized in disappearing from the bar for long stretches of time or alternately forgot that she was working and spent her time socializing with a friend of hers rather than taking care of customers periodtoken  her disappearing act occurred at all times when our food arrived commatoken which relieved her of her burden of making sure our food arrived and whether we needed anything periodtoken  further commatoken after we finished commatoken we again waited commatoken and waited commatoken and waited for the check periodtoken  the bartender was completely out of the restaurant chatting with the same friend that took all her attention while she was at the bar periodtoken  even after she came back from her adventure with her friend commatoken we had to ask for the check at least twice before it was provided periodtoken  it was clear that the last thing that the bartender wanted to do was her job periodtoken    bottom line commatoken there are many pizzapasta restaurants in this city that will be getting my business from here on out commatoken and i recommend that others do the same periodtoken","7960":"service was excellent and they tried to make a good experience commatoken but i will never come back periodtoken food was beyond expensive and not even close to being good periodtoken ordered the clam chowder and it was beyond salty periodtoken not sure if it is normally like that or bc it was nearing the end of its batch periodtoken then mussels in red sauce came out periodtoken beyond small and not enough flavor periodtoken about half the mussels had meat that was a penny size periodtoken that is not acceptable periodtoken we then ordered crabs that came out drier than the sahara dessert periodtoken although meaty commatoken the price of 7 periodtoken50crab was beyond crazy periodtoken the crab seemed way over cooked and then cooked again the manager did make it better by bringing out 2 new crabs that were better without us even asking for replacement commatoken which was a definite plus commatoken but they need to do something about price periodtoken i went when the crabs are in season so there is no need for the price to be that high periodtoken i thought fries were good but my husband think they were to soggy periodtoken i thought it was the only thing that was seasoned correctly periodtoken   concluding commatoken if u want good food for a reasonable price commatoken dont come here periodtoken if u just want the service commatoken then this is the place periodtoken go to chickies and petes for delicious crabs","7962":"funny how the location is closed citing it out grew its location periodtoken i live in the area and pass by it frequently commatoken most food places have some kind of line during lunch periodtoken not once did i pass by big q did they have a line periodtoken often youd see the workers messing about inside commatoken killing time out of boredom periodtoken the food explained it commatoken it felt like the owner was trying to create a bbq fast food franchise chain commatoken the idea was great but the food was sub par periodtoken the pulled pork never had enough bbq sauce on it commatoken and the fries were even worse periodtoken even if there was ample indoor seating commatoken no one would have went periodtoken big q is an embarrassment to real bbq pit masters commatoken like smoken dudes in bensalem who have worked for years to create the perfect bbq periodtoken","7965":"i ordered the half rack ribs with corn bread and mashed potatoes periodtoken ribs are very chewy and dry periodtoken the corn bread and mashed potatoes are both very good periodtoken fired up bbq is better periodtoken will only come back here for the corn bread and mashed potatoes periodtoken","7971":"while the dessert case looked awesome commatoken i got a grilled chicken salad and didnt like it at all periodtoken the chicken was ok bland but the ranch dressing tasted like mayonaise periodtoken my boyfriend got a club which is hard to do poorly so it was good periodtoken the server was sweet commatoken i just wish the food was better periodtoken","7975":"plain interior commatoken ok service commatoken bland food periodtoken not bad commatoken just not worth it in the plethora of french quarter options periodtoken midday on a sunday and theyre out of grits commatoken shrimp commatoken and seafood benedict  really  boudin was dry and tasteless periodtoken eggs and hash browns were good commatoken but heck commatoken even i can fix those well periodtoken bavarian chocolate iced coffee was decent periodtoken","7976":"despite all the hype commatoken i felt daves dogs were severely overrated periodtoken the previous reviews were not offpoint when saying the hot dogs were good commatoken but they were not the best hot dogs ive ever tasted periodtoken  during my visit commatoken i tried daves style and the sb style periodtoken both were solid in that the ingredients looked fairly fresh and it was wellcooked periodtoken however commatoken given its price commatoken it easily couldve been a costco hot dog which is bigger with additional condiments placed on top periodtoken   thus commatoken taking into account the price commatoken hype and execution commatoken i felt that daves dogs are beneficiaries of a strange bandwagon effect periodtoken tldr good hot dogs commatoken but overpriced and overhyped periodtoken","7977":"definitely wont be returning to this location periodtoken i parked in the lot directly beside remedy and received a 50 dollar parking ticket periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i was literally in the cafe for 5 minutes and my 5 chai turned into 55 periodtoken if the service would have been quicker i probably wouldnt have even gotten a ticket periodtoken the tea was fine but i could hardly enjoy it after that experience ruining my day periodtoken i wish they were more specific on their parking considering i asked an employee if i was allowed to park there periodtoken","7984":"hassled us about our service dog commatoken messed up both of our orders periodtoken im pregnant and cant have raw egg so we told the waitress she said no problem periodtoken i got an over medium egg commatoken raw in the middle commatoken so we sent it back periodtoken they just scrapped off the fried egg and put scrambled on but there was still raw yolk all over the plate periodtoken waitress tried to be very nice about it and blamed it on new kitchen staff but we wouldnt go back periodtoken","7985":"my husband and i used a living social coupon to eat here recently on a saturday night for their 3course dinner wwine pairing and it was nothing to rave about  except that it was a great deal and the wine was good  service was friendly commatoken but lacking somewhat periodtoken i periodtokene periodtoken no one refilled our water commatoken no one came by to see how we were doing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey just set the items on the table and moved on the food was mediocre at best except for the first course i had soup for the starter and it was a pretty good creamy asparagus soup periodtoken my husband had some sort of decent salad commatoken but it was unmemorable commatoken obviously periodtoken i had a bland salmon entree commatoken and it was way overcooked and dry periodtoken i did not eat it all periodtoken it was served with a bland rice dish  that i skipped all together periodtoken there were snap peassnow peas also as a side and they were actually done perfectly periodtoken  my husband had a small steak and it commatoken too commatoken was a bit bland commatoken but cooked nicely periodtoken for dessert commatoken we were served some sort of sickeningly sweet chocolate thing with berries periodtoken meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni doubt we will be back periodtoken coupon or no coupon periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthere are too many good restaurants now in reno to have to put up with this type of food periodtoken one word uninspired periodtoken","7988":"we stopped by for a scoop of ice cream commatoken but definitely eyed the baked treats in the dessert case periodtoken there are a variety of fairly standard flavors ice cream periodtoken overall commatoken i found them a little too sweet commatoken including the cinnamon bun and the black cherry that i sampled periodtoken","7990":"im not sure this is the same place as some of the other reviewers went to apparently periodtoken  after hearing all of the buzz commatoken me and my girlfriend tried this place one early sunday morning periodtoken  we ordered one of every flavor they had that day periodtoken we figured we would treat it more as a sampler than a meal periodtoken though all of the donuts had lots of visual appeal periodtoken none were found to be anything worth raving about periodtoken they were very dry and had surprisingly little flavor periodtoken save for the ones with some sort of filling periodtoken this at least made them somewhat salvageable periodtoken  im left with the opinion that maybe some of the reviews on here were posted by people with some personal connection to the owners periodtoken its a shame commatoken  the concept was first rate periodtoken but the donuts were not periodtoken","7991":"went here for lunch today and really was not impressed with the food or the service periodtoken  pizza is way too salty and burned for my taste periodtoken my husband and i used to come here when they first opened and of course the service was great periodtoken service has started to decline significantly periodtoken  today we waited forever for our food commatoken never got our waters refilled commatoken and had to wait 20 min to get our check while our waitress chit chatted with another waiter in the corner periodtoken  come on in riva commatoken you can do better","7993":"my family and i havent been here in about 5 yrs  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we will not go back again periodtoken periodtoken i dont know if there is new management or what commatoken but the ceiling has a huge hole in it right near the tables where we sat periodtoken periodtoken it was constantly leaking and no bucket was being used periodtoken you cant tell me no one noticed it   also the bathrooms were a mess periodtoken periodtoken the floors were sticky and one of the toilets wouldnt flush periodtoken periodtoken the water was leaking out of the joints and running all over the back of the toilet periodtoken 2 our if the 3 sinks were broken periodtoken we were really disappointed in the look and feel of this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken very slow service when it was dead also periodtoken periodtoken  sorry but go elsewhere periodtoken periodtoken","7995":"district donuts commatoken a slider donut fusion restaurant commatoken is an interesting concept but their donuts are just not up to par periodtoken i ordered a couple of different donuts to try and they were all very bland bread donuts with different toppings on top periodtoken other than the toppings commatoken there was nothing special about the donuts at all  especially considering the elevated price tag periodtoken  skip district and go to blue dot in mid city instead periodtoken","7997":"ive had mixed experiences at broad ripple brew pub periodtoken i like that it has a weekly special menu along with a permanent regular menu periodtoken some of the best items ive had there are on the weekly special menu  but then some of their regular foods are a bit disappointing periodtoken   last night my bf ordered the fish and chips off the regular menu  the fish was drenched and drowning in oil commatoken and and all we could taste was the oil periodtoken i ordered the vegan dolmades plate  it was tasty commatoken but my dolmades could have had a lot more stuffing in them periodtoken they were mainly grapes leaves with little filling periodtoken i also think 9 for the light portion is a little steep periodtoken  finally commatoken the service was so slow periodtoken they were moderately busy commatoken but the restaurant should have been able to handle that size of a crowd just fine periodtoken  in sum commatoken the quality of the food could be much better periodtoken their menu has a lot of items commatoken but maybe they should focus on what they can make consistently tasty periodtoken","7998":"an unimpressive breakfast establishment with mediocre service and food periodtoken  my friends and i wanted to find a sitdown breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work periodtoken after browsing through yelp commatoken it seemed like ghinis was the only candidate nearby periodtoken although their door and website state that they opened at 630am commatoken they seemed to be running late and didnt open until 645am periodtoken we had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes periodtoken eventually commatoken our waiter came and commatoken being slightly flustered commatoken took our orders quickly periodtoken i was surprised to find that you cant order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe apparently commatoken theyre separate businesses for example commatoken you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table commatoken but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter strange periodtoken anyway commatoken i ordered the egg proven\u00e7al with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast periodtoken it really did seem like i had an overcooked order of 6 eggs  just a huge portion off rubbery sadness you might be better off ordering the eggs over easy periodtoken  the toast was overly buttered as well commatoken which is fine if you like it that way periodtoken the only good thing i had was their cafe au lait commatoken which was served in a huge mug periodtoken my friend had the breakfast sandwich commatoken and she thought it was decent periodtoken with just a few tweaks commatoken ghinis can be great commatoken but im afraid id go elsewhere for breakfast or brunch periodtoken","7999":"the only reason why the rating isnt lower is that dinner in person at tre lune can be a really nice experience periodtoken the service and food quality can be top notch periodtoken  ordering take out is another experience altogether periodtoken  sure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a montecito restaurant but we didnt realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food qualityconsistency periodtoken after all isnt food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over  the latest takeout experience involved ordering garganelli with chicken and mushrooms periodtoken one order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought  on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg periodtoken we have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal being facetious of course but there doesnt appear to be a way to post those while writing this review periodtoken keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in periodtoken  the same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added periodtoken  our advice  dont order takeout at tre lune periodtoken  if you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu commatoken then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way periodtoken  ps periodtoken and no commatoken these are not the only examples periodtoken  there are others but clearly we didnt learn our lesson and continued ordering periodtoken  the last experience may have sealed the deal for a long while periodtoken","8000":"my hubby and i ate dinner here last night periodtoken we expected better food for the price periodtoken it cost us 33 periodtoken00 and we didnt even have entrees periodtoken  i got a pulled chicken sandwich on brioche toast with smoked mozzarella cheese periodtoken the chicken tasted ok but it was kind of dry periodtoken i guess i should have put some extra sauce on my sandwich periodtoken the french fries were crispy and flavorful periodtoken  my husband got a brisket sandwich on brioche toast with mozzarella cheese commatoken a side of cole slaw and an order of dry rub wings periodtoken the brisket was so fatty that my husband left most of the sandwich uneaten periodtoken the cole slaw was tasty but the dry rub wings were overcooked and dry periodtoken they looked burnt to me periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  the only other bbq place in the area is in jenkintown so we will keep bbq bbq in mind periodtoken i dont think well be eating here too often though periodtoken","8002":"came during lunch on a friday periodtoken  we were allowed to sit immediately which was a good sign periodtoken however commatoken a very large group was using their back private area therefore the available tables in the front room were very deceiving to the expected wait times periodtoken waves and waves of plates were taken to this apparently huge group in the back before we realized what was going on periodtoken this of course led to us waiting almost an hour for our two plates periodtoken in a properly run establishment the decision should be made to not allow more and more patrons to take a seat and order until a reasonable wait time is to be expected periodtoken we would have even been ok with them having given us a warning as we sat that wait times were going to be much longer than expected periodtoken very easy step to take periodtoken the servers were clearly overworked due to managements bonehead decision to allow customers to continue to sit periodtoken  eventually our food did come but it wasnt worth an hour wait periodtoken we wanted to like this commatoken but bad customer flow management left a bad taste in my mouth periodtoken   super easy fix guys dont seat people when the wait is going to be that long periodtoken","8003":"the food here was quite good and the ambiance was lovely periodtoken but the service is what earned 2 stars periodtoken they take your order commatoken bring you water commatoken bring over your food commatoken and then you never see them again periodtoken pictured is the french toast and the blonde slinger periodtoken maybe i would return for to go food commatoken but never dining in again periodtoken","8006":"jerky is reasonably priced but not high quality by any means periodtoken have had much better jerky with fewer ingredients and better taste in many other places periodtoken none of the jerky is made inhouse commatoken instead this is a chain operated by a sole proprietor periodtoken it was a great idea for him to open this place bc it attracts tourists like a magnet commatoken but being a local i think my first time shopping there will be my last periodtoken bought the turkey jerky in teriyaki and pepper flavor and i have to say even the bagged jerky from the grocery store tastes way better periodtoken the sales guy was kind of meh commatoken but i wouldnt say he was rude or aloof commatoken just not overtly friendly periodtoken to each their own commatoken but i think theyre trying to push a mass produced jerky that only appears to be homemade periodtoken overall commatoken kind of a tourist trap periodtoken","8009":"i really wish i could write a better review for blondies periodtoken   its the closest coffee shop to me commatoken its clean commatoken has nice decor commatoken and an ok lunch menu periodtoken   what they lack is service periodtoken i ordered a half sandwich with the soup du jour and one of my friends ordered the same half sandwich with a different soup periodtoken after my friends received their meals commatoken we waited for mine to arrive periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and we kept waiting periodtoken  after we were sure that someone had forgotten my order i flagged down a waitress and told her i was still waiting for my lunch and she replied yeah its coming commatoken the soup du jour takes longer because they have to make it right then commatoken you know and hurried away periodtoken what does that mean that they cook each soup of the day to order  if it had been worth the wait this would be a different story commatoken but when that small cup of soup finally did come with my 12 sandwich commatoken it tasted like salt periodtoken disappointment upon disappointment","8013":"im pretty much with everyone else on this one  kind of a disappointment periodtoken i had a good time commatoken but the night market itself didnt have too much to do with it periodtoken it was nice to enjoy a comfortable fall evening with friends and people watch with all of the cool people and to have my second helping of capogiro of the day commatoken but it was disappointing periodtoken   it was the first night market commatoken so theres obviously some kinks to be worked out commatoken and it was obviously advertised a little too well and the extra week to spread the word about it probably didnt help much either periodtoken the lines were so long commatoken the food ran out fast commatoken the ceviche was a little small and it seemed a little pricey and unsubstantial and i dropped one of my shrimp commatoken and the crowd commatoken while lively commatoken was oblivious and desperate periodtoken the stands and trucks were grossly unprepared for the amount of people that showed up periodtoken hopefully these problems get worked out by the next one periodtoken  some idiot girl hey commatoken idiot girl commatoken truth hurts came up to me while i was enjoying my plum  bluecoat ginpistachio gelato and was like is the capogiro free commatoken as if she and her friend were floating through the crowd looking for free stuff periodtoken what uh commatoken no commatoken nothings free periodtoken come on periodtoken night market periodtoken its built into the title periodtoken come on periodtoken  either way commatoken this was kind of a bust commatoken but i still look forward to the next night market periodtoken","8017":"food is good commatoken service really needs improvement periodtoken its very obvious there is minimal leadership here periodtoken hopefully things improve as the restaurant becomes more established periodtoken","8023":"the largest mainline grocery store in the immediate area periodtoken  design and aisle width are a throwback to the 1950s periodtoken  the prices are high enough that you wont spend that much more getting your topend  fresh items at somewhere like dibruno bros or maxs produce periodtoken  so that leaves this place for nonperishable items such as canned goods commatoken etc periodtoken  and with a little planning ahead commatoken why not buy these outside of the rittenhouse area where you will pay a lot less  ok in a pinch but generally go higher end for your fresh stuff  lower end for your nonperishables if you can periodtoken","8025":"this has always been the only fast food restaurant i will let my kids play in periodtoken for years commatoken it was always clean and well kept periodtoken but the last several times weve been commatoken a serious decline in its cleanliness has occured periodtoken obviously commatoken a kids play area is going to get dirty periodtoken but the dirt in there now is the stuff that has just been neglected periodtoken cobwebs and food crumbs are caked into the corners and the cubby holes for shoes periodtoken you can also tell it no longer gets vacuumed on a regular basis commatoken as the dust floating in the air is thick periodtoken     but this is my main complaint periodtoken we were just their yestetday commatoken a saturday commatoken  at noon periodtoken the place was packed and people were having to stand with their trays waiting for a table periodtoken at this time commatoken two seperate tables were being utilized by a single employee each periodtoken a two top and a four top periodtoken both employees casually enjoyed their lunch while playing on there cell phones commatoken completely oblivious to all the customers waiting for tables commatoken while our food got cold and i personally wrestled with two crabbing kids right in front of the girl employee periodtoken everyone deserves a break at work periodtoken but maybe not in the middle of the lunch rush and in the middle of the crowded dining room periodtoken","8028":"if the food want good this would have been just a one star periodtoken  service is slow commatoken the kitchen is ungodly slow and this is in an airport periodtoken    on top of it commatoken bartender dropped my girlfriends food and didnt even say anything to us about it periodtoken until it showed up 10 minutes after mine periodtoken     my recommendation is to only order beers here and save the food order for somewhere else that cares periodtoken","8043":"my only complaint with this location is the disgusting bathroom periodtoken any other target close by such as sicklerville  deptford are way cleaner  this bathroom has only 3 stalls commatoken the toilet seats look like they need to be replaced and the entire restroom is obviously never cleaned during the day periodtoken   they are currently renovating the entire store and hopefully they make the bathroom bigger with new toilet seats at the very least periodtoken","8047":"not a fan periodtoken this eatery likes to take originals

periodtoken  they have done a fantastic job generating buzz commatoken kicking out interesting looking creations commatoken and building a brand periodtoken  however commatoken the quality behind that brand is lacking at this point periodtoken  when it comes to donut quality commatoken this is where their energies need to be focused periodtoken  fundamental baking skills are lacking periodtoken  its more than about how you dress it up commatoken its about the quality of the pastry itself periodtoken  donut drivein and donut stop kick out a highquality pastry no matter the style periodtoken    strange donuts has brought the magic of voodoo donuts to st periodtoken louis but they need to focus on the basic periodtoken  otherwise commatoken theyre just cool looking objects in my facebook feed periodtoken","8057":"stayed at gsr for reno dance sensation and as a captive audience had a meal at johnny rockets periodtoken  the amount of fries served with a burger was a little skimpy and at 6 for a malt it seemed waaaaaay over priced periodtoken  the malt had good flavor but was runnier than i prefer periodtoken  onion rings should be ashamed of themselves periodtoken  not even close in flavor to being worth the calories periodtoken  burger was average got the bacon one periodtoken  fry flavor was pretty good  i liked the presentation of the smiley face of ketchup in the dipping dish

blended and her frappuccino and my grandmas both had waffle crumbles on top when that wasnt even what they ordered periodtoken   also to top it all off the store was dirty commatoken and no one had a smile or a good attitude periodtoken when i brought it to someones attention that my frappuccino was wrong i ordered it with no coffee  he snatched the cup from me threw it away and proceeded to make me the new one periodtoken periodtoken  my dad ordered that same frappuccino  and could have taken the mess up home instead of throwing it in the trash periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   over all

commatoken ive gotten hair in my burrito periodtoken once i can let slide commatoken but twice is a pattern and it really grossed me out periodtoken the staff seems to be mostly young girls with long

understand the place is new but someone from their corporate office should have done a better job training periodtoken what would lebron say if he knew","8214":"i arrived at 630 periodtoken waited in a 25 minute line periodtoken barely any chicken in my salad bowl and the chips were incredibly stale periodtoken total disappointment periodtoken","8215":"first time here and purchased a 6 inch cake for 15 periodtoken a little pricey for such a small cake periodtoken it was very dry and the icing fell off the cake once i cut into it periodtoken the part that put me over the edge was that i found not one but two strings  maybe coarse hair in the cake periodtoken very disappointing for my husbands birthday periodtoken i give two stars because the employees were friendly periodtoken","8216":"honestly the rudest employees periodtoken walked in waited at least 8 minutes for them to come over when they werent busy at all i was the only person in the place periodtoken so i finally order and i get a medium iced coffee and then ask if i get a free donut national donut day today which they have been advertising commatoken she responds super annoyed yeah and turns around to grab a random donut when i asked for a plain glazed periodtoken she says commatoken you dont get to pick your donut periodtoken periodtoken and starts talking in another language to me and then to the other employee periodtoken i tell her i couldnt understand her and she ignores me commatoken snatches the bag and grabs the random donut she put in there commatoken puts it back and gets my glazed donut periodtoken acts all annoyed and tells me again that i cant pick my own donut but shell do it periodtoken interesting commatoken because the advertisements say otherwise periodtoken overall terrible experience periodtoken","8217":"i always love attending these types of events commatoken especially if it involves food the south street night market 81513 was way too crowded that we were only able to try three food trucks and thats only because each of us stood in line individually for 1hr to get the food periodtoken   was pretty disappointed with surf and turf trucks lobster rolls as it was all bread and no lobster the samosas at samosa deb were good but the line moved way too slow for having only 20 people ahead of you periodtoken another truck with the walking taco amazing but sorry forgot the name made me like fritos chips again with its mix of pulled pork and beans in the fritos bag periodtoken and their porknado was tasty too but by the time the bf got back to me with it commatoken the soft pretzel was no longer soft   they had a cute concept with printing out instagram pictures but we werent able to find ours   i think ill pass on future night market unless there is some better crowd control because this was insane and the worst i have experienced at food events","8218":"since yelp does not allow us to report people for their inaccuracy commatoken intelligence

perceptionopinion is commatoken maybe yelp is smart after all periodtoken  no profanity was used in the entire episode over this cake periodtoken  we said they will be reported on all online sites and the next time i want to speak to a real manager who is over 12 periodtoken  you just showed your ignorance periodtoken  stay off yelp please as you add nothing to the conversation and should really find something to do periodtoken we did report you for having affiliations with parrot petes as that would be the only reason anyone would take the time to get on yelp and lie periodtoken i mean commatoken how sad really periodtoken  shame on you too and i hope something like this happens to you on one of the most special days of your life or to someone you love periodtoken    with that said commatoken i updated the review to 2 stars since someone another manager maybe did respond to our review on facebook to offer a refund and to say the employee was dealt with and they are very sorry periodtoken  so sue c you can rest assured as you continue with your sad life and go there twice a week that your favorite little restaurants average just increased a very small amount periodtoken","8222":"i dont want to say that the last thing this town needs is another chain pizza place periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut if it does periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit sure as heck had better be fantastic periodtoken   not the case here periodtoken  after a painful 20 mins of trying to navigate their on line ordering i just gave up periodtoken  the pics looked so great and there were some pretty good reviews here on trusty old yelp commatoken so i called in periodtoken   it was a saturday night and they were busy periodtoken  even ordering over the phone was kind of a pain periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut we got though it periodtoken  the food came in less time than they estimated commatoken the delivery guy was very nice and seemed to have his act together periodtoken  but then we tried to eat the pizza commatoken and that is where we made our mistake periodtoken   the pizza was very thin and had nearly no crust  normally commatoken this wouldnt upset me too much periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut the whole idea behind this places gimmick is that they offer so many flavored crusts  the pizza was slightly worse than the 1 titinos ya buy at the super market commatoken and roughly the same size periodtoken  and it was 16 periodtoken   there were wings too periodtoken  not nearly as disappointing as the pizza but most definitely from frozen commatoken preseasoned and just bad periodtoken   the only reason i gave howies two stars was because of the sandwich periodtoken  thank goodness my far better half had a craving for an italian sub or our meal wouldve been a complete waste of time and money periodtoken  the sandwich was a little different periodtoken  it seemed to be made out of a folded pizza crust periodtoken it was pretty tasty and fairly large considering the very low price i would even consider returning if only for the italian sub periodtoken  i think it was priced under 5 and fed us both periodtoken  though we did have some bites of awful pizza and substandard wings to help get us through periodtoken  anyway commatoken if cheap food is what youre after periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhave at it periodtoken  if quality is your thing commatoken skip this place periodtoken  it is an embodiment of what is wrong with chain restaurants periodtoken","8223":"other reviews spot on periodtoken  you wait to be seated but they will text you periodtoken   you wait at the table to served commatoken you wait to get food periodtoken  plan at least 1 periodtoken5 hours for breakfast periodtoken  eggs benedict egg was overcooked and hard periodtoken  bummer periodtoken","8230":"if krispy kreme is a donut shop commatoken then why is it so hard to get a fresh donut my boyfriend came home with a dozen and a half of their cream filled and they were extremely chewy commatoken dry to the touch and stale tasting periodtoken what a bummer commatoken youd think theyd sell fast enough to keep them coming fresh commatoken so if that isnt a testament to how their business is sliding downhill commatoken then i dont know what is periodtoken","8232":"this place is definitely not built for speed periodtoken these guys are very very slow after 11 p periodtokenm periodtoken if you want something in a hurry do not come here they take forever periodtoken i will probably not visit this location again periodtoken","8233":"tried one dish broccoli with zoodles noodles made from zucchini and potatoes periodtoken salmon was added periodtoken the salmon was very good commatoken the zoodles alright commatoken the broccoli was yellowed tinged with age and tasteless periodtoken the home fried potatoes were mushy and also tasteless periodtoken based on this dish i would not return to bff commatoken of course others may be better periodtoken","8240":"as a business owner why would you close up and lock the doors at 1050 if you dont close until 1100 on a saturday night the chicken is awesome but the service is beyond horrible they give a whole new  definition to the word rude  we will definitely limit our visits periodtoken im not a fan of bad service","8244":"i am confused by all the positive reviews this place has gotten periodtoken  the atmosphere was fine and the coffee fine commatoken but the service was unfriendly and the food wasnt great at all periodtoken  honestly commatoken all the people that worked there looked like they hated life and it was the worst place in the world to work periodtoken  none of them smiled in the 1 periodtoken5 hours i was there periodtoken  as far as the food commatoken it was 4 for scrambled eggs and 1 for any add ons you want ie spinach commatoken onions commatoken cheese commatoken etc periodtoken ok fine thats reasonable commatoken but seriously it was the smallest portion ever and didnt even taste as good as homemade scrambled eggs periodtoken  total let down periodtoken  i thought any place could make decent eggs commatoken but apparently not periodtoken  i really wanted to like this place commatoken but sadly was really let down periodtoken","8250":"10 minimum on charge really the donuts are subpar the

much better results periodtoken","8252":"if youre going to pay 5 for a scoop of something commatoken go to jenis periodtoken expected something great commatoken was delivered something okay periodtoken aesthetically they are trying to be five daughters but the location is off periodtoken take your risk with eggs periodtoken staff was nice periodtoken there was also a nice sign in the bathroom periodtoken","8257":"the only thing worth getting 2stars were the sweet potatoe fries periodtoken  i dont know but i would think if all you do are burgers then you could get the temperature right periodtoken  i ask for a prime burger med periodtoken rare and it came out well done periodtoken  also the bottom of my bun was over toasted so it started to fall apart periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot a good experience","8258":"came here for an event and had buffet here periodtoken i came here multiple times and i feel like the food is getting worst and worst periodtoken its neat that you can make your own shabu shabu here but the broth is not good periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenunless you boil it for 30 minutes with some soy sauce and meats periodtoken this place is clean and big for a buffet but it lacks variety of the food periodtoken stay away periodtoken really stay away from the soba noodles periodtoken it tastes so bad i never had a soba noodles that blend in my life periodtoken their sushi and rolls are okay but not the freshest periodtoken if you get the salmon right when they put it on the platter commatoken expected to be little frozen periodtoken but in the end commatoken you get what you pay for","8259":"so was there today w my family and victoria was our server periodtoken i ordered a chicken caesar wrap and it had about 8 pieces

to go order and i know the waitress forgot periodtoken we were all done w our food and i asked her where the to go order was and she said it should be right up periodtoken then she disappeared and came back 10mins later w our order periodtoken she also slammed our glasses down when she brought our drinks over periodtoken not a happy customer manager needs to walk around and ask his customers

parking is problematic periodtoken","8264":"the past four times ive ordered online commatoken each order was wrong commatoken all four times periodtoken once the order was so wrong they took half of the ingredients in my moms salad and put it in my brothers steak bowl periodtoken they took half of the ingredients in my brothers steak bowl and put them in my moms salad periodtoken they are complete opposites and ended up not eating either of their meals periodtoken how do you mix up an online order that bad the ingredients are all listed for you periodtoken my order has also been completely wrong before periodtoken its like i get someone elses bowl and thy take the lid with my name on it and stick it on someone elses bowl periodtoken i used to go here once a week periodtoken havent been there in a month now which really is unfortunate because i love their food periodtoken staff is a mix of nice and rude commatoken depending on who you get periodtoken wish i had a better

for our burgers periodtoken i love their wings commatoken but dont think ill eat in there again periodtoken we actually tipped another server that took care of us periodtoken i think ryan was his name periodtoken place was not busy when we got there periodtoken  damn it its so close with such a good beer selection sorry commatoken pub periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken youre almost there commatoken but need some efficiencies put in place or a talent review periodtoken","8270":"really unsure what the fuss is all about with this place periodtoken   as ramona p periodtoken mentioned in her review commatoken the counter help is a hit or a miss periodtoken ive stopped by here on multiple trips to new orleans commatoken and every time im hoping for a better experience periodtoken ill subject myself to rude staff if the offerings are primo  but alas commatoken even the fabled hamandcheese croissant is lackluster periodtoken  chelsea m periodtokens review mentioning the coffee is akin to breakroom coffee is spot on as well periodtoken  what i do like about this patisserie is its proximity to tulane commatoken that its located on maple street really a cool area commatoken and that their pastries are a nice treat but unfortunately not the best nola has to offer periodtoken","8273":"the bagels were ok commatoken nothing worth raving about periodtoken  but poor customer service in my opinion and a 10 credit card minimum periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenits 2011 really  i wont be back there id rather drive a bit farther and get a friendly smile and be able to charge 6","8278":"went with 8 friends for wine and something light to eat periodtoken it was a friday night but not really busy periodtoken there were empty tables periodtoken  we studied what was on offer periodtoken the server was helpful periodtoken  we ordered six appetizers to share and each ordered a flight of wine periodtoken you could order their selection or build your own flight periodtoken you could select three periodtoken  the wine was just ok periodtoken i preferred the riesling while the others the chardonnay periodtoken neither were impressive periodtoken  the appetizers were just ok too periodtoken no one was impressed periodtoken  it was difficult to get the servers attention periodtoken we either had to wave arms of go to them periodtoken  we all agreed there was no need to return periodtoken","8279":"this mcdonalds is ok for the most part via drive thru periodtoken but dont waste your time going inside periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe whole drink area is really old and looks like its about to fall apart periodtoken the ventilation in there sucks so the whole place usually smells pretty gross periodtoken like another reviewer also said commatoken this place is sometimes not serving certain items after midnight commatoken and theyll refuse to make them for you periodtoken","8280":"i read a number of bad reviews before i went to momo commatoken but decided to try it anyway because we were in the area periodtoken first off commatoken the place was empty but i had to keep looking for my server periodtoken every time i ordered commatoken shed come back ten minutes later saying they were out of whatever i ordered periodtoken when i finally decided on something they werent out of commatoken my entree showed up periodtoken this place says they serve ramen commatoken but this isnt ramen periodtoken its a bowl full of chili oil and onion water periodtoken i was pretty disappointed periodtoken","8283":"whelp commatoken my friends and i was super excited to find this truck we heard so much about it because one of my friends followed it on twitter trying to catch it in his neighborhood periodtoken finally we found it and ordered the cheese curds for eight dollars and we spent another  periodtoken50 each on a dipping sauce periodtoken the people there were friendly enough and explained to us the difference between mozzarella sticks and what they were offering and seemed very confident that it would be better than anything weve had periodtoken so excitedly we went in for a taste  of the four of us one didnt care for them at all and would not eat a second one periodtoken the other three of us thought they were okay but nothing to write home about but none of us could finish them  too much cheese periodtoken i would have preferred that mine wouldve been breaded a little bit heavier and fried a little bit longer so they were crispier but what we kind of ended up with was a bit of a soggy mess periodtoken we were very surprised commatoken due to all the raves commatoken and sadly disappointed periodtoken i think with the amount of money you spend for them youre really hoping for a better experience periodtoken if they had cost less we would have had lowered expectations periodtoken the reviews and cost raised the bar periodtoken so commatoken would i buy them again commatoken or recommend someone else buy them well if you like mozzarella sticks these are a creamier version and would do the job but there is not enough of a difference in this item for me to buy them again periodtoken","8286":"the casino is under major construction commatoken so getting in and out are kind of hectic commatoken but its a nice facility periodtoken i have two major issues here though 1 periodtoken the hard rock brand in and of itself is an experience for customers commatoken whether or not its the casino a restaurant or a museum periodtoken therefore commatoken people who work there should be expert enough on the brand and tourist attractions to guide customers and answer basic questions about the primary thing that makes hard rock a brand the legendary items and artifacts that are the basis of the business periodtoken no one who worked there could direct us to any of the artifacts we were looking for periodtoken not even the two people at the information desk periodtoken thats really a disadvantage to the organization and lessens the enjoyment for the customer if they have to walk all around the casino to look for a picture of prince or patti labelles dress periodtoken they need to have some sort of manual or chart that documents where things are and the workers need to be trained on it too periodtoken 2 periodtoken my second issue is that their food court absolutely sucks periodtoken for this to be such a big casino and such a big tourist attraction commatoken they need to expand their food offerings periodtoken there are like 3 food court options and then theres the hard rock restaurant commatoken which isnt of interest to lots of people being that the food is mediocre at all of them periodtoken ive been to several hard rock restaurants across the country and the food is consistently mediocre and chainy periodtoken unfortunately the food court offers no rescue either periodtoken","8287":"the staff here on multiple occasions has had their hands no gloves in the chips eating right out of the chip tub in front of me so freaking gross","8288":"it just gets worse  now they have dropped their early bird special periodtoken was looking for something else to try on that menu as the chicken parm was not good periodtoken nowhere near enough sauce commatoken but this is a moot point as they just disenfranchised a lot of customers","8289":"i love bareburger and the two star review is purely for the service periodtoken  for such a small establishment the wait time was actually ridiculous periodtoken  im completely patient and can understand a wait time ive chosen to come in at a busy hour periodtoken coming here twice in the same week with indifferent service staff and waits up to 20 minutes for the first swing by for drink orders and then 30 minutes for the food seemed excessive periodtoken","8292":"hands down the worst bbq place ever  the crispy chicken sandwich was 3 chicken tenders on a soft roll with nothing else periodtoken  the bbq chicken was dry and overcooked periodtoken  the sauce was great and that should have given a little container of it to make the dry tasteless chicken go down easier periodtoken  the baked beans were pretty good commatoken thats the only reason they got a 2 stars from me periodtoken  i will definitely not be going back","8301":"in short commatoken the parts of my experience was better than the whole periodtoken i ordered the fishermens special which isnt on the menu periodtoken its supposed to come with avocado commatoken which they were out of periodtoken asked for lightly toasted bagel commatoken it was burnt around the edges periodtoken it didnt taste like it had scallion spread on it and for 10 periodtoken74 commatoken it seems overpriced for what i  received periodtoken the nova was okay as was the whitefish salad which i picked off because my bagel was burnt periodtoken  back to real jewish delis periodtoken trying to diversify","8303":"like others commatoken i want to love this place but the prices are high and the donuts didnt impress me periodtoken  no where to sit and eat your donuts commatoken so they have to be for takeout periodtoken","8307":"great for higher quality food items commatoken but my only complaint is the slow commatoken lazy baggers and checkers periodtoken they act like they just woke up or something and its mid day periodtoken from all of my experiences there over a couple years commatoken the baggers always put unlike items together in the same bag like bleach with my milk commatoken etc periodtoken if you want a good experience here commatoken go through selfcheckout commatoken youll guarantee a proper bagging of your items commatoken and they wont dribble the items down the conveyer belt and bruise and squish your stuff periodtoken twice ive said something to the store manager and she just defends them commatoken but trust me commatoken you can smell crazy on her commatoken she seems a little off commatoken in my opinion periodtoken","8314":"service was terrible i was so upset since it was a small group of us for two of our friends birthday and unfortunately the server ruined our whole night periodtoken    first when he greeted the first of us from our party he says commatoken hi periodtoken ill get your drink order when the rest of the party is here periodtoken umm commatoken no periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i would like a drink please  it took 45 min periodtoken for our food to come and not once did he stop by our table to keep us updated periodtoken  he passed out our food without speaking a word while he did so periodtoken  all of the burgers were dry and cold periodtoken  the fries were hot commatoken but soggy periodtoken  he never came back to ask how it was so we had to flag down a different server who also seemed to not give a sht periodtoken  we finally just wanted to get the hell out of there and it took 20 min periodtoken to cash out commatoken which he had added gratuity for this awful experience without again saying a thing or even a thank you periodtoken   so disappointed by the service and food quality this time around periodtoken","8321":"havent been there in sometime and will not be racing back periodtoken wonder if it actually may be going out of business periodtoken we walked in and were hit with a strong very unpleasant odor periodtoken there were no customers in there periodtoken most

it was cheap and relatively good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken not anymore periodtoken they raised their prices and the quality of food has gone down drastically periodtoken","8330":"if you like and enjoy lots of sodium and grease this is your place periodtoken im not sure but it seems they may dip burger in butter periodtoken at any rate flavor is filled with grease and fat periodtoken   homer simpson would love this place periodtoken fries were very saturated as well periodtoken","8331":"good pizza periodtoken  crust is proper and toppings are generous periodtoken  some creative choices available periodtoken  if you dont like slices commatoken and i dont commatoken the smallest pie you can order is 16 periodtoken  i think a 10 or a 12 would be a wise offering commatoken especially if you want to sell some of your other menu items periodtoken that brings me to my next point periodtoken  what is the deal with the afterthought sushi bar  its totally out of place and the obviously low turnover rate of the contents would put off any sushi lover periodtoken note to ownersmanagers  you cannot run a restaurant to serve as a hangout for your family and friends commatoken and still expect normal customers to be comfortable periodtoken  most of the small dining area was occupied by a large group just filling up space and encouraging their many children to have the run of the place periodtoken  bad for business periodtoken   this was not a good experience and i would not return periodtoken  probably a moot point because i dont see this place surviving unless some sweeping changes are made periodtoken","8339":"the cold brew coffee is either not cold brewed commatoken a terrible brand of coffee commatoken or it was brewed days ago periodtoken it is so incredibly stale periodtoken i am pretty upset i paid 3 for this periodtoken   everything else though commatoken is delicious periodtoken","8341":"today i was extremely annoyed periodtoken i always place an

get lunch back to my brother before he left the house and i ended up not making it home in time periodtoken i waited 20 minutes until i received my order periodtoken considering this is not the first time this has happened commatoken it irritates me even more periodtoken the point of an online order is for me to come in and receive my order on time periodtoken the staff could tell how annoyed i was and didnt even apologize for my wait periodtoken super disappointed periodtoken","8350":"this was my first visit to the broad ripple hotbox periodtoken i will not be going back we paid 20 periodtoken15 for a large thin crust pizza and an order of breadsticks periodtoken the large pizza was the size of a medium most other places ive been periodtoken it was supposed to have extra cheese periodtoken it didnt periodtoken on top of that it was overdone and dry periodtoken it was one of the worst pizzas ive ever had periodtoken definitely not worth the money we all were wishing we had gotten a little caesars for 5 periodtoken  not a good showing hotbox","8351":"this place is a hit or miss periodtoken been here three times and its been a miss twice periodtoken i just moved to keswick village and i was so excited to have a place to get bubble tea and sushi within walking distance i got bubble tea here the first day i moved commatoken and was annoyed because they didnt seem to understand what i was ordering commatoken and i was making myself very clear periodtoken most of my anger erased when i mostly ended up getting what i ordered periodtoken had chinese here with a large group commatoken no problems commatoken not the best not the worst periodtoken tried to get bubble tea here again commatoken hoping maybe it was just the person i originally dealt with commatoken but alas commatoken no periodtoken too frustrating to order a dang bubble tea from here commatoken and i now get my chinese take out from yummy yummy periodtoken   i am disappoint periodtoken","8356":"i ordered the sweet potato hash with 2 eggs periodtoken the eggs were too well done commatoken but the hash was good periodtoken i also had a biscuit commatoken which was soggy periodtoken my husband had french toast monte cristo periodtoken the bread was still doughy and not cooked enough periodtoken the only reason i have it two stars instead of one star is because they

not eat it in the shop because of the obnoxious rap music being played periodtoken","8365":"i always hope to find a good local place to get my daily iced mocha commatoken but unfortunately it just

periodtoken a rich sweet and creamy taste of mocha periodtoken yesterday i went through the drive through and placed my order commatoken when at the window to pick up was asked if i wanted sweetener added periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken huh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken why i mean commatoken its a mocha not a diet drink periodtoken i was told that the iced mocha comes unsweetened and if i want it sweetened commatoken i must request that periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so ok commatoken go for it periodtoken what i got was a rather bland watery drink periodtoken for

but thats not what i drink periodtoken","8371":"500 degrees burgers sansom and 15th st periodtoken are delicious periodtoken but when your concept is nononsense chow commatoken that you specialize in one item and cut on all nonessential commatoken your process should be frightfully efficient commatoken and it really  isnt once past the admittedly good order taking periodtoken two burgers shouldnt take 15 mn to prepare periodtoken  and fries think crispy next time periodtoken limp lukewarm fries that have been sitting over the fryer for the 15 mn it  takes to prepare the burger belong to one place only the trash can periodtoken   also commatoken hygiene commatoken much you might want to work on that periodtoken i saw a guy bring a box of tomatoes commatoken obviously not washed periodtoken they still had the stickers on commatoken and you dont put washed tomatoes back in their box periodtoken and then he cut them on the cardboard periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken that is just asking for trouble and sick customers periodtoken  not coming back periodtoken","8372":"the service is exactly what i expect from a fast food joint  slow and lousy periodtoken    food is served lukewarm periodtoken  double check anything you get from the drive thru periodtoken  dont expect fries to be cooked thoroughly periodtoken  and dont dare ask what kind of salad dressing they

for subpar tasting food periodtoken but the wait staff was nice the burger meat tastes strangelike theres absolutely no seasoning in the ground beef or something periodtoken also commatoken they make their own ice cream cones in the lobbyice cream shop which smelled amazing periodtoken when we went to go look commatoken the cone irons were filthy with rawhalf cooked  batter piled up right next to

the best fast food burger i have ever tried better than five guys and even better than innout periodtoken if i wrote the review back then commatoken it would probably be 45 periodtoken  but commatoken that was then periodtoken what happened did they change chefsownerssomething i ordered the classic combo with truffle fries and the strawberry milkshake commatoken while my lady got the burger of the

did i just get punkd   everyone take a look at the photos that other yelpers have submitted periodtoken beautiful little thing commatoken isnt it this night commatoken not so much my burger was

not much better either periodtoken the burger was also put together like the mcdonalds down the street from me commatoken nasty periodtoken the egg had already popped and left a watery mess periodtoken she didnt even finish the burger periodtoken that doesnt make me feel too proud after talking up the 500 degrees burger for so long periodtoken  the truffle fries barely tasted like truffles periodtoken it actually tasted normal commatoken but was decent periodtoken it could have been a bit crunchier commatoken since i hate limp fries periodtoken   the milkshake was the highlight of our meal commatoken but then again commatoken who messes up a milkshake   yes commatoken this was a long review for a horrible experience periodtoken yes commatoken i am a little harsh on a

that the food is fantastic periodtoken so i guess your asking why two stars then periodtoken im giving it two stars because on mondays the live band is horrible and the band is so loud that it is impossible to talk to anyone at your table even if they are sitting right next to you periodtoken its a mexican establishment not even playing mexican music periodtoken i highly recommend avoiding this place commatoken at least on mondays periodtoken","8393":"the staff deserve 45 stars periodtoken but theyre closed randomly commatoken and its statring to deteriorate periodtoken eat there before it starts sucking periodtoken great local art periodtoken still commatoken a gem of meremac periodtoken","8396":"went to fermentaria for lunch with three friends periodtoken probably would have been better if we drink beer commatoken but none of us do two of us had mushroom tacos commatoken which were tasty but not much there for the price periodtoken the peas  carrots salad was okay commatoken but really overpriced at 12 periodtoken the person having the fish tacos asked for the chipotle mayo on the side commatoken only to be informed that the chef will agree to leave out an ingredient when possible but will not allow anything to be put on the side so commatoken she got a seinfeldian no chipotle mayo for you maybe we could understand if this was a gourmet chef in some very exclusive restaurant commatoken but  seriously the customer cant decide how much or how little chipotle mayo to use bad business in my opinion periodtoken the chef needs to chill and show some flexibility periodtoken ps my friend didnt like the fish taco dish at all and only ate a small portion of it periodtoken the menu is very limited and prices rather high for small plates periodtoken plus side our waiter commatoken darren commatoken was terrific","8397":"disclaimer  my wife is a head chef so im kind of spoiled on really good food commatoken so i have high expectations periodtoken  wife and i went to lc for an early dinner last saturday periodtoken i had bought the 20 for 10 deal commatoken so when we got there and the waitress offered to make us margharitas commatoken i was all for driving two blocks and picking up a midlevel bottle after we ordered the apps   the mango margaritas were very tasty periodtoken out came our empanadas and mole periodtoken i was surprised how small the empanadas were and there were only two 2 periodtoken my wife and i both come from the food business and we have run restaurants and cafeterias periodtoken we know it costs about 2535 cents to make the empanadas and mole commatoken and they were charging 7 periodtoken50 for each dish the food was good i must say commatoken but it did not knock our socks off periodtoken   the pulled pork did not have enough mexican spices in it commatoken it kind of reminded us of bbq pulled pork periodtoken the seafood enchiladas were good commatoken but for 18 bucks they brought me out a side of hot sauce commatoken complimented the food well periodtoken  when we got the bill i notices they had charged us 7 periodtoken00 for the margarita mix commatoken and 1 periodtoken00 for the small side of hot sauce periodtoken i felt like i was being nickel and dimed and the prices were a little steep periodtoken i would like to try out other mexican restaurants in area and then compare them to lc commatoken but for now periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken only two stars for this one periodtoken despite everything it was a pleasurable experience commatoken i think it helped that we had just come from philly brew co commatoken and drank beer for an few hours beforehand periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8400":"i realize this is a new restaurant but they really need to get their act together periodtoken  the interior is bright and well finished and the staff was very nice but did not know the menu very well periodtoken  we ordered at the counter and the food is brought to your table periodtoken  although it was not very busy at all commatoken the food took a long time to arrive periodtoken  an order of scrambled eggs was supposed to be two eggs and arrived with only one on the plate periodtoken the biscuits were cold and the housemade jam  listed on the menu as a part of the plate did not come with our food periodtoken  it was delivered when we asked about preserves for the biscuits and  came to the table on a coffee saucer commatoken not a serving plate periodtoken  not a huge dealbut not the expectation of a nice new restaurant periodtoken  after we had received out food commatoken a second order with the same order  was brought around the restaurant periodtoken  not a big deal except for the fact that the second order clearly had more scrambled eggsand more full plates and included jamthey ended up sending those breakfasts back to the kitchen periodtoken  our food commatoken while okay commatoken was not very warm either periodtoken  the coffee was excellent and was piping hot periodtoken   additionally commatoken we were overcharged for our orders as the prices were incorrect in the computer periodtoken  the staff quickly corrected the overcharge but we wondered why after a month in business the prices were not correct periodtoken  we should have commented to someone but no one asked  how was your meal today so we just really wanted to eat and leave periodtoken  would we come back  maybe commatoken if there is more attention paid to detail and food arrived in a timely manner periodtoken  the quality of the food was good but got lost in the lackluster presentation periodtoken","8401":"it was our first time eating there and we all ordered mild periodtoken the food was so spicy and hot that we couldnt finish most of the dishes periodtoken if this was mild commatoken i would hate to taste hot periodtoken all we tasted was hot commatoken not flavor periodtoken in addition commatoken one of our party ordered the duck commatoken which wasnt ready when the other dishes were periodtoken after asking three times when it would be done commatoken we canceled that part of the order commatoken and then they brought it out anyway periodtoken if they had told us that the duck would take a half an hour longer than the other dishes commatoken it wouldnt have been ordered periodtoken service was fine commatokenand the duck was taken off the bill periodtoken","8409":"delicious product and all commatoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i went in for my free birthday bundlet periodtoken  i shouldnt have periodtoken  i mean commatoken its not helping my diet or anything periodtoken  i asked for the gluten free chocolate chip cake because i thought maybe thats healthier or something periodtoken  what do i know  well i do know something periodtoken  they asked me to pay  periodtoken51 cents because the gluten free cakes are more expensive periodtoken  i gave her the money and then said commatoken wait commatoken what  i thought it was free periodtoken  shes all commatoken well commatoken its a little more expensive to make periodtoken  were just trying to cover our costs periodtoken  is that ok  i said commatoken no periodtoken  its not ok periodtoken  the email didnt say you can have anything but the gluten free or that the gluten free would cost 51 cents periodtoken  it just said free periodtoken  is paying 51 cents free  she said commatoken well commatoken no periodtoken  its not periodtoken  i think i said something about how its not even truly gluten free because of crosscontamination and using the same equipment to make everything periodtoken  she then said commatoken would you like your money back  i said yes commatoken i would periodtoken  now commatoken i also could have asked for a receipt and probably taken them to small claims court for false advertising periodtoken  if you think im being cheap commatoken ask yourself how cheap it is for them to advertise free and then ask for money periodtoken  now commatoken a lawyer most likely wont touch a minor lawsuit commatoken but its important for them to follow the law periodtoken  false advertising is false advertising whether the amount is 51 cents of 51 million cents periodtoken  i didnt enjoy my cake nearly as much as i would have if it werent for this periodtoken  i know most people would just go along with it and have a little bad feeling and go its just 51 cents commatoken why argue periodtoken  i guess i think its just 51 cents commatoken how dare they ask periodtoken","8410":"i had been to mad mex for drinks and apps in the past and had a fairly decent experience commatoken but the food i ordered tonight for dinner was straight nasty periodtoken  i ordered a salad that arrived and was missing half of the ingredients it claimed to come with on the menu periodtoken  on top of that commatoken the salad came with bean sprouts which i guess were not washed commatoken because every time i bit into my salad it felt like i was chewing on dirtsand periodtoken after discovering that my salad had dirt in it commatoken i really couldnt keep eating it periodtoken i feel like washing lettucegreens is something all restaurants should have down commatoken especially for almost 14salad periodtoken  disappointing and i will probably not be back anytime soon periodtoken","8421":"we used to get pizza from her every couple of months periodtoken it was decent and we liked the flavored crust options periodtoken however commatoken after our last visit we will not return periodtoken i ordered a pizza for pick up commatoken picked it up and went in to work periodtoken this is a job where my kids come with me after my kids took their first bite they were complaining of the pizza being too spicy periodtoken the crust was red commatoken which was really weird because i ordered the garlic crust periodtoken so i called to tell them that we didnt get what we ordered periodtoken the guy seemed to remember my pizza and said it was their sriracha crust periodtoken they offered to make me another pizza but i was at work and couldnt leave to go get it periodtoken the guy told me not to order that pizza if it was too hot for my kids and i explained to him i didnt order it and they messed up periodtoken after talking to the manager they said there was nothing they could do periodtoken really you guys didnt give me what i ordered periodtoken we wont return here for pizza again periodtoken","8422":"this is my third visit to maynards periodtoken this is my first review of it periodtoken  my first visit was good periodtoken my second visit was fair periodtoken this last time was terrible periodtoken  we arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 20 minutes to be seated periodtoken  service was very slow and lousy periodtoken  martini was a half filled glass periodtoken  bread came after our salads periodtoken   the porkchop  was fatty and small periodtoken  my daughter had the duck   it was bloody rare and had to be sent back periodtoken  management did not even follow up on the problem periodtoken    overall a terrible experience periodtoken  i am done with this place periodtoken","8425":"the food wasnt hot commatoken overcooked commatoken and not the way we ordered it periodtoken the waitress was not the best and seemed not to care about the problems we encountered periodtoken  the check was brought and we werent asked about coffee or dessert  not that we would order it after all the problems we had periodtoken  none of us 7 enjoyed the meals periodtoken  the best part were the two appetizers we had periodtoken the third appetizer was almost cold periodtoken we dont plan to hurry back periodtoken","8436":"wifi is terrible coffee is average periodtoken we got the vegan wrap and it was really dry and bland periodtoken so sad because it looked good periodtoken but just no flavor and not nearly enough sauce periodtoken the texture was hard to swallow because of how dry it was periodtoken","8439":"this review is for the pub commatoken not the beer periodtoken but after probably the fifth or so time ive been to 4 hands commatoken i think im done periodtoken   the time before commatoken i stopped in to see about a growler fill periodtoken i was told that none of the specialty beers which are few were available for growler fills commatoken even for my halfgrowler periodtoken i dont really understand this policy  i mean commatoken what is the difference between buying two pints at the bar  buying two pints togo its not like im trying to horde their rare stuff or buy high gravity beer in mass quantities periodtoken but nothing  even the stuff i can buy in a 22 oz at schnucks  was available for growler other than the stuff easily found outside the brewery periodtoken   which is not to say anything negative about their stuff in cans periodtoken im always pleased to see it at music venues and restaurants periodtoken i love contact high periodtoken alter ego is nice periodtoken and the usual suspects  single speed commatoken divided sky commatoken etc periodtoken  are solid commatoken reliably good beers periodtoken   but i just dont see much point in visiting the brewery periodtoken theres rarely anything special or unavailable elsewhere periodtoken this time they were out of the cuvee diable commatoken which left the one hitter quitter malt liquor nope and vigilante nice as the only rare finds in the place periodtoken compare this with schlafly and urban chestnut and perennial commatoken all of which offer plenty of treasures to entice visitors periodtoken i had the passion fruit prussia commatoken which i loved commatoken but like everything else commatoken it can be found outside the brewery commatoken and none of it can be purchased for a growler periodtoken it doesnt seem like an intentional destination brewery commatoken but an afterthought that they might as well sell the stuff on tap that they work so hard to package  retail periodtoken   and finally commatoken the music sucks big time periodtoken somebodyies with an attention deficit issue was shopping around satellite radio for anything under the sun commatoken from dr periodtoken dog to bill withers to kool  the gang commatoken and they switched off in the middle of the commodores for the same damn dr periodtoken dog song a second time periodtoken boooo periodtoken just another suggestion that the brewpub effort lacks intention commatoken the focus is on the retail periodtoken it was the last straw to convince me that i dont need to hang here anymore periodtoken","8443":"food is the same as that from any other panera periodtoken  service is just not that friendly though periodtoken pardonnez moi for asking for freezer bags for my bagels periodtoken does it really cause you to have to exert that much more effort","8446":"all i have to say is the chipotle staff is ridiculous they are beyond stingy with the ingredients dont put too much we may have to restock the burrito bar and then we would actually have to work seriously they lined the bottom of my husbands taco perfectly a straight one level line of steak in a rather large crispy shell dont go to over board with the meat after all whats a taco with more than 6 tiny cubed pieces of steak i have given up on this location periodtoken time after time of staff being so lazy about the amount they put in a taco or in a bowl periodtoken i dont feel i should have to ask for more or pay for double meat when the double meat portion is what should actually be in my order ever other location i have visited knows how to make a proper burrito or taco commatoken this location is just simply lazy save your money and go to qdobas they are not chincy with their meat","8453":"eh periodtoken thats how i felt about the food periodtoken not delicious commatoken but not terrible periodtoken the portions are huge commatoken so you get what you pay for periodtoken the rice and salad were tasty but my chicken and potatoes shared the same seasoning and they were both over seasoned periodtoken the pita bread came out of a plastic bag so you had some grocery store pita on your plate periodtoken eh periodtoken  still in the hunt for some good greek","8454":"drove from florida to see it because saw it on food network periodtoken the kale salad was the feature and we asked for it periodtoken for the first time ever commatoken they said commatoken they were out of there famous kale salad periodtoken other food was decent but very disappointed periodtoken","8455":"i had such high expectations periodtoken  ive been to the chocolate bar and roosters commatoken and both of those were outstanding commatoken but baileys range was  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken eh periodtoken  i ordered the american burger and it was just okay periodtoken  i thought the mac and cheese patty would make the burger commatoken but it really didnt add much to it at all periodtoken  on top of that commatoken i was not a fan of any of their homemade sauces i tried periodtoken  i wish i would have liked it better periodtoken  on the plus side commatoken they have a fantastic selection of beer","8458":"probably the worst wawa in the tristate region periodtoken they are always out of stuff periodtoken and the stuff they do have is not of the wawa quality that i come to love from wawa periodtoken also there are always food crates on the floor which i think is a a health violation periodtoken the only good thing about them is their bathrooms are clean periodtoken but the management seems to think the best time to clean them are during the busiest time of the daynight periodtoken","8460":"for the 3rd time ive ordered my favorite meal from this taco bell commatoken and they just cant pull of the correct ingredients with their equipment periodtoken i get a 6 commatoken which is 2 chalupas commatoken hard taco commatoken and a drink periodtoken i always get chicken commatoken no tomatoes commatoken add nacho cheese commatoken hard taco and mtn dew baja blast with hot sauce periodtoken tonight i got beef chalupas commatoken tomatoes commatoken onions commatoken dont come with it in the first place a soft taco commatoken an ice tea of all things commatoken and surprisingly hot sauce periodtoken and the fact that chicken and nacho cheese cost 2 periodtoken50 more is not why im mad commatoken all 3 times there was nobody in line commatoken and not even inside periodtoken so from now on im going to the one and keystone and 62st street periodtoken sure im going to wait in like for 20 minuets but at least i know my order will be correct periodtoken even when its a cluster at 1am with all the drunks commatoken id rather deal with that than a terribly inaccurate order of castleton tbell periodtoken","8462":"we walked in and several tables were dirty commatoken not to mention it felt rather humid inside periodtoken i mean i get its a tropical place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but i dont want to feel the humidity periodtoken lol periodtoken i order and found that they were widely backed up with the orders periodtoken i dont know if the were understaffed or just busy it was rough periodtoken its an open kitchen so i could see cooks standing around \u200d periodtoken the drink area and sauces bar were a mess periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken obviously because they were busy after waiting 15 minutes commatoken they started on my order  periodtoken i got my order 23 minutes after ordering it periodtoken \u200d periodtoken this place needs some help periodtoken a for effort","8471":"this store disappoints on so many levels periodtoken bad customer service commatoken prefrozen seafood commatoken prefrozen chicken periodtoken is it so hard to put out fresh product with a smile","8481":"ive been here three or four times commatoken and have had very different experiences depending on who is working periodtoken  overall though commatoken i dont think ill be back periodtoken    there are a lot of nice things about this place  theres plenty of comfy seating commatoken and the menu is actually pretty diverse for a place that focuses on wine first and food second periodtoken  ive had the cheese plate commatoken a couple of apps commatoken and sandwiches on various trips commatoken and each time the meals have been solid periodtoken   on the other hand commatoken theres a lot about this place that rubs me the wrong way periodtoken picking a midpriced bottle of wine can be tricky for the nonexpert periodtoken  the last time i went i chose a bottle commatoken and the waitress said we dont have that one periodtoken  they had to rebottle it or something because it was messed up periodtoken  ill give you a couple of minutes to find something else periodtoken  maybe im overly fussy commatoken but i thought it was weak she didnt suggest something similar off the menu to try periodtoken  i always feel a little adrift when picking from a wine menu and the help of an expert can go a long way in making me feel comfortable periodtoken    at 1040 i checked someone who was not our waitress manager or owner i think brought over our check and said we close at 11 periodtoken  okay fine periodtoken  sort of tacky commatoken but the dude has places to be i guess periodtoken  so we sat there and finished our wine and chatted and at 1050 i checked again the guy is flipping off some of the rows of lights and sweeping etc periodtoken commatoken basically letting us know we needed to get the hell out of there periodtoken   now commatoken i get that you want to get home commatoken and its annoying when youve just got one table between you and freedom commatoken but were paying customers commatoken and it you close at 11 commatoken shoo us out at 11 if you have to periodtoken  i work in a job where if somebody shows up at 8 commatoken and we close at 8 commatoken i put on my biggest smile and invite them into the store and try to make some money periodtoken    lastly commatoken i thought it was lame the owner had a boohoo note scotchtaped inside all of the menus about how he had to charge 1 extra for anyone to use a credit card because the evil cc companies were charging him too much periodtoken  if you need to make more money commatoken train your servers to suggest specials commatoken or dessert commatoken or gasp wine periodtoken  there are a million ways to make an extra buck per customer that dont involve a gauche note in the menu periodtoken    my verdict  good food commatoken good wine selection commatoken but at times very shaky service and management periodtoken  ill spend my leisure dollars elsewhere periodtoken","8483":"dont get the noodle bowl periodtoken it was excessively salty and almost half onions periodtoken also commatoken wasnt even in a bowl sad also commatoken the jerk chicken sandwich was more of a ginger sandwich periodtoken overall commatoken lunch was meh periodtoken","8485":"we are all familiar with mcdonalds commatoken its menu and what it consist of so ill skip through that all periodtoken the only area i feel left to critique is its service and staff periodtoken  well me being a local ive gone a number of times and the service is very inconsistent commatoken often forgetting cheese commatoken sauce etc periodtoken again its mcdonalds and its a part of who we are so ill continue to go back commatoken but is it just me who believes the constant forgetfulness of condiments is only a way for them to cash in  next time forget to give me an extra burger or order of fries","8495":"im not sure what is made to order or premade or made in house periodtoken they were unable to make anything for me that was slightly altered for allergies periodtoken almost any italian restaurant i have been too commatoken is able to make the sauce without an ingredient for me periodtoken the inside atmosphere is pleasant periodtoken","8497":"bland periodtoken everything was bland periodtoken i have eaten there twice and both times was disappointed periodtoken even their beer is bland  tried one of their pale ales and the flavor was shallow and fake periodtoken they were out of the local brew i originally ordered periodtoken lettuce wraps lacked flavor with slimy chicken periodtoken spicy peanut chicken noodles had no flavor periodtoken boring food commatoken boring atmosphere commatoken just boring wont be back periodtoken","8500":"i used to eat at the old cairdeas  and then i stopped because of time it took to prepare the food periodtoken  when i needed a coffee or a chai tea commatoken i left in a good mood periodtoken  but when i went for a meal commatoken i always became irritated periodtoken  im all about fresh food made to order commatoken dont get me wrong periodtoken  but when my waits extended past 20 minutes commatoken i began seeking another coffee joint with veggie wraps and wifi periodtoken  once i took a friend and we sat outside and chatted for over half an hour and i finally couldnt stand it  i asked the people behind the counter about the order and it had been forgotten periodtoken  the sad thing was i assumed they were still making it due to my previous experiences periodtoken  i never even considered eating at the new one until recently periodtoken  i figured it had been quite some time and perhaps things had changed periodtoken  the entire experience was amazing  except the wait for the food periodtoken  the girl at the counter couldnt have been friendlier commatoken the menu was great commatoken my chai tea was as good as it gets commatoken i loved the new decor periodtoken  we went after lunch so there was only one other person sitting in the cafe side and there didnt seem to be much activity in the dining area periodtoken  my friend and i chatted commatoken then i pulled out my laptop to quickly check email commatoken then i showed my dining companion some pictures commatoken then i put my laptop away periodtoken  after awhile he asked if he could use my laptop to pay some bills periodtoken  after the bill paying was complete we asked about our food and the obliging girl said she would check on it periodtoken  after another wait although a small wait this time commatoken two veggie wraps arrived periodtoken","8503":"place was awesome the one time i sat at the bar periodtoken this time i sat at a table periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and sat periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and sat some more periodtoken 15 minutes total the whole time i saw the bar tender saving a spot for his buddies who pulled up and got immediate service periodtoken ended up walking out and re locating 5 minutes before the lightning game started periodtoken if the bar is packed walk out","8506":"i love hw but this was my first time at this location and beyond disappointed i usually go here due to the quality of the produce however this location was terrible periodtoken periodtoken there is fresher produce at walmart  wont be back","8508":"those who give cafe bamboo 5 stars are simply hard up for a vegetarian restaurant in new orleans  i feel your pain but cannot in good faith give this place 5 stars periodtoken  went for dinner on a wednesday evening and sat outside in the courtyard periodtoken  service was unbelievably slow in spite of there being two or more waiters and less than 8 tables periodtoken  drinks were almost never refilled as we waited at least 45 mins for our entrees to arrive periodtoken  when they did arrive commatoken they were generally mediocre periodtoken  this place relies heavily upon meat substitutes which to me signals a lack of creativity in the kitchen periodtoken  flavors were not great commatoken presentation was hohum periodtoken  looking forward to the opening of the green goddess so cafe bamboo doesnt have to bear the weight of being nolas only veggie restaurant commatoken because obviously they cant handle it periodtoken","8511":"summary unfriendly serverhost commatoken frozen vegetables used and subpar

periodtoken seems like kids were running the place periodtoken periodtokenhorrible first impression periodtoken   two diners commatoken we ordered tikki masala and vegetable korma periodtoken tikki sauce was too thick commatoken sweet and tasted like it was store bought periodtoken 6 chunks of chicken for 15 rice wasnt flavorful at all periodtoken tasted like long grain white rice periodtoken  vegetable korma tasted like frozen vegetables that had been reheated periodtoken naan was excellentonly reason im giving 2 stars periodtoken maybe lunch buffet is better","8513":"i would definitely have to agree with byron j periodtoken on this one we seem to frequent many of the same locations periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i live about 2 miles from five guys and i rarely crave red meat

want to grab and go periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensecond commatoken it is underwhelmingly decent but not a fantastic burger periodtoken    when a place specializes in one thing commatoken i think it should be done perfect commatoken every time commatoken no exception periodtoken  the one thing i do like about the burgers is the bacon periodtoken  they do the bacon awesome periodtoken  everything else is just average commatoken which is fairly disappointing considering its all they do periodtoken  i also think its ironic that they boast about how fabulous they are on every wall periodtoken too bad none of those are local periodtoken  maybe ill check out a five guys in another city commatoken but i would recommend hardees over this joint and they are a lot faster","8517":"went back a second time just because its in a great location and i really wanted to like this place periodtoken my noodle was under cooked and the pork had way too much fat periodtoken

periodtoken  alas commatoken there was a big thing i found to be lacking at the local taco  salt periodtoken  every single thing i ate commatoken from each taco  i tried the vegetarian commatoken buttermilk fried chicken commatoken the buffalo commatoken and korean bbq  to the lobster enchilada commatoken to the jalape\u00f1o coleslaw commatoken lacked a punch of flavor periodtoken  how could this be  were talking ingredients like melted cheese commatoken even tangy buffalo sauce which was a little on the sweet side commatoken and jalape\u00f1o commatoken and i felt like something really lacked in the flavor of every item i had periodtoken  except for the fried green chili mac n cheese commatoken and the korean bulgogi meet stood up flavorwise periodtoken   its more than affordable

periodtoken me thinks that many commatoken if most commatoken have not tried allegros periodtoken  ok commatoken i start sampling flavors periodtoken i think im going to try as many incommon flavors as allegros for a fun comparison periodtoken start with one of my perennial favoritessalted caramel periodtoken yuck periodtoken tastes artificial periodtoken ok commatoken cinnamon next periodtoken nope periodtoken the same periodtoken this is not good periodtoken two of what should be home run flavors foul out periodtoken maybe a fruit flavor will be better periodtoken strawberry periodtoken ugh periodtoken tastes like grocery strawberries periodtoken coming from ca commatoken thats not a compliment periodtoken how does ivan at allegro gelato get his to taste so much like fresh ca freshberries only three flavors and already my mouth is frosted periodtoken  my wife tried peanut butter crunch commatoken pumpkin commatoken and cinnamon periodtoken she said they all kind of tasted the same periodtoken she loves anything peanut butter periodtoken she passes periodtoken  she ends up with cookies and cream periodtoken its ok periodtoken in desperation commatoken i try chocolate periodtoken acceptable periodtoken  after experiencing allegro gelato commatoken it was disconcerting to watch them just slap the gelato in the cup periodtoken almost unappetizing periodtoken im thinking commatoken youre not slinging mortar to lay bricks isnt your product better than that  i liked the flakes of chocolate in my flavor periodtoken it gave it a little nice texture to it periodtoken but lets compare other qualities periodtoken the texture of frost in this chocolate was not bad periodtoken the texture in the other flavors were more airy than at allegro periodtoken one thing that struck me was that with allegros gelato commatoken there is a wonderful after taste that lingers on the taste buds like a romantic memory on my palate periodtoken twas not so with frost periodtoken the flavor was only present when it was in my mouth periodtoken  like allegro commatoken frost has a round cookie see photos they put in the cup of gelato periodtoken it is a cheaper cookie than the hazelnut cream filled pirouettes you get at allegro periodtoken i mean its a good cookie commatoken but im comparing here commatoken and it is not of the quality at allegro periodtoken  the spoons periodtoken ah commatoken here is where they outshine allegro periodtoken they are multicolored mini spadelike paddle things periodtoken and bigger than what allegro uses periodtoken they are kind of cool periodtoken  prices are comparable with allegro periodtoken service is really good periodtoken my server always called me sir periodtoken many employees on a friday night made for fast service periodtoken  so bottom line is frost is ok periodtoken at least the chocolate periodtoken the rest tastes like medicine to me periodtoken will you frost fans commatoken who obviously have fallen in love with gelato commatoken go give ivans gelato a try hes not only italian like the owners of frost commatoken i understand but he got his degree in italy at the gelato university in

people walk periodtoken  too much in a very tight corridor periodtoken     the vendors are your typical craft fair circuit folks periodtoken  always the one booth selling tasers next to the spice booth periodtoken  cigarette smoke competed with bbq smoke periodtoken   bring a lot of cash as you will spend around 2 for a wing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlittle cheaper by the dozen periodtoken  the vip tent is nicely set up where you can actually sample all the vendors wings under one tent instead of standing in a long line making room for strollers and smokers periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut it will cost you 75    this event would be ideal in a spacious regional park periodtoken  bring the price down commatoken make more room to eat your costly samples and offer an affordable option to sample all the vendors in one line periodtoken  i would gladly spend 20 for a dozen wings from a dozen different vendors on one plate periodtoken  the country music live band was nice but the experience is quickly ruined by cigarette smoke and homeless meth head looking people dancing periodtoken   i think this event has a lot of potential if its not in downtown reno under the casinos shadow periodtoken","8552":"the pizza lacks periodtoken go to eddie  sams a couple of minutes away commatoken you wont regret it periodtoken the pizza tastes not great mostly because of the cheese periodtoken not sure how they cook it to come out almost fried on the pizza periodtoken it crumbles almost periodtoken i make the trip to downtown for eddies even though this precinct is closer periodtoken the service was not good also periodtoken i regret to say its better to try something else periodtoken","8553":"the service is atrocious periodtoken the chicago style pizza is mediocre periodtoken  the ambiance is suitable for folks who incessantly use instagram  lots of old advertisements commatoken toys commatoken and trinkets to give you the false impression that the place is hip and worthy of your cash periodtoken yes commatoken cash periodtoken they dont accept credit cards commatoken so enjoy hitting the bank up on the way or giving a charitable contribution in the form of an atm fee periodtoken","8556":"service was great periodtoken food was the downfall here periodtoken my fries had obviously been sitting around for awhile my nuggets were mushy periodtoken so im assuming they were too periodtoken the stars are for the service periodtoken","8560":"i went to dinardos because i love seafood and ready many reviews that this was one of the best seafood restaurants in philly periodtoken well commatoken i disagree periodtoken we went for blue crabs commatoken but they ran out 9 days ago periodtoken okay commatoken it happens periodtoken we ordered the crab soup periodtoken it tasted like canned vegetable soup periodtoken we ordered a pound of overpriced snow crab legs periodtoken nothing to jump for joy about periodtoken we paid extra for garlic butter commatoken and that was the saving grace periodtoken we also ordered the broiled seafood platter where you got the smallest sea scallops commatoken a soggy piece of farm raised tilapia commatoken 6 jumbo shrimp commatoken a half pound of snow crabs and a silver dollar sized crab cake periodtoken the crab cake was the standout on the dish periodtoken i opted to take the fish home and finish cooking it periodtoken   we also ordered cocktails periodtoken they were just okay periodtoken the ambiance was dated and could use new or cleaned carpets periodtoken we tried it periodtoken likely will not be back periodtoken next stop devons","8563":"tried to sit outside but the speakers are blown and blasting static periodtoken i spent 18 on a   spider roll and an eel avocado roll periodtoken the spider roll came with miso soup and salad periodtoken lots of food but none of it that good periodtoken","8564":"food is pretty good commatoken but yet i still only give this place 2 stars periodtoken service is below average and prices are high periodtoken if you charge prices thid high you better deliver and they fell short periodtoken","8565":"the play area is quite good and big periodtoken they have a few pretty impressive play structures so lots for the kids to do periodtoken i had the banana bread and breakfast sandwich periodtoken the food is much to write home about periodtoken the banana bread taste like its probably store bought and the breakfast sandwich resembles the precooked variety periodtoken they are not unreasonable for the price periodtoken my biggest dislike about this cafe commatoken however commatoken is the fact that all of their utensils commatoken cups commatoken and plates are disposable periodtoken for that reason alone commatoken i probably wont come back periodtoken","8573":"this review is strictly for the togo boba drinks periodtoken  we were in the same plaza for dinner and while we were waiting for our food to arrive commatoken i did a little search on yelp periodtoken  this place came up and i mentioned to my party that this place serves boba and my party insisted to get a few drinks from here after dinner periodtoken  i walked inside after dinner and noticed that this place was packed periodtoken  when i walked inside commatoken i saw that they had a separate section for drink orders so i proceeded to that station periodtoken  the guy who was standing at the drinks section commatoken pretty much gave me a look and ignored me periodtoken  another guy showed up and asked me what i wanted periodtoken  i told him that i wanted to order 2 drinks periodtoken  he told me to wait a minute and came back to help me out a few minutes later periodtoken  i ordered a large thai tea with boba and jasmine milk tea cant remember periodtoken  a few minutes later commatoken our drinks were ready periodtoken  i immediately grabbed our drinks and left periodtoken  when i finally had the chance to try the thai tea with boba commatoken i thought it was just mediocre periodtoken  it didnt have the thai tea flavor that im used to getting even at thai restaurants and the boba was too soft periodtoken   no comment on the jasmine milk tea since i didnt get to try it periodtoken","8575":"youd think for a place called brodo that youd be able to get a decent cup of soup periodtoken  well commatoken youd be wrong periodtoken  i stopped in today after trying to get into nom nom which was mobbed and they dont offer take out periodtoken  wth  but thats another review periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  brodo looks very sleek commatoken new and nice periodtoken  prices seem low enough  but it ends there periodtoken i got a 12 sandwich veggie and a cup of soup their version of italian wedding periodtoken  i asked if i could substitute cheddar for the american cheese which is a waste of tasteless fatcalories and was told they only have shredded cheddar  but i could get swiss or provolone periodtoken  so i opted for no cheese periodtoken  meanhwile commatoken i start to eat it back at the office and there is a weird horseradish taste to the mayo periodtoken  i think they goofed and put horseradish mayo on it periodtoken  weird  but not bad periodtoken  the soup was saltladen and not even close to being delicious periodtoken  not goin back periodtoken sorry periodtoken  i spent 8 periodtoken40 for the combo no drink periodtoken oh commatoken and the line waas not bad when i went  but if there is a long line commatoken dont wait in

attempted to go to lunch periodtoken  never happened periodtoken  the parking situation is horrible periodtoken  80 of the parking spots are marked as compact and are very commatoken very narrow like smart car size periodtoken  smaller than normal compact size periodtoken   circled the parking lot 5 times and it was chaos before leaving periodtoken  4r needs to work out an over flow maybe with the funeral home next door periodtoken","8581":"i went to las cazuelas for the first time last week and the best part about the experience was the tequilla periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand we brought that with us periodtoken  from start to finish commatoken this place was a disappointment periodtoken  the place was completely empty when we arrived and we still had a long waits for service periodtoken  this is a byo so we brought tequilla with us but expected they would make our margaritas periodtoken   instead they brought the maragarita mix to the table and told us to pour the tequilla in our glasses and then add the mix periodtoken  admittedly commatoken this did allow for stronger drinks which were needed by the time our appetizers came out periodtoken  all of the food we ordered seemed extremely greasy commatoken especially the queso which basically solidified before it got to our table periodtoken  i have been to some really good mexican places in the city but this clearly is not one of them periodtoken","8583":"my sisters and i went for lunch commatoken the place was busy of course which that wouldnt be a surprise commatoken the main entrance greeters hostess

periodtoken the only thing that came was the chicken jalepeno wings periodtoken they  ouldbt eat yet because there were no plates or napkins  i had to flag down any waiter i saw because i dont know where ours went commatoken the other waiter brought it periodtoken they began to eat mind you still waiting for our drinks and my loaded fries nothing periodtoken i had to flag down our waiter to ask what was going on with the delay commatoken he apologized  and said hell be back thats fine periodtoken well at this point he comes with all our foods and drinks at the same time defeated the point of appetizers but anyways periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe are eating and i noticed no fries for none of our sandwiches had to flag down another waiter to please go get our waiter by this point we were getting upset periodtoken  he came back with the fries bit we were almost done with our burgers periodtoken i then wanted another drink peach lemonade he took so long to come back when did he came back with something  else so i had him take that back periodtoken by now we wanted to leave because honestly the service was poor periodtoken  i then had to flag the hostess down to get our waiter periodtoken  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenshe did we asked a box he came back with the smallest box ever so we had to stuff the fries and my sisters wings in this little box periodtoken i can say that he did come fast with the check though and to pick it back really quickly periodtoken they didnt want me to leave him a tip but i still did anyways periodtoken i dont think we will come back her again 1st impression is always key periodtoken","8585":"hopefully they will find their way but this promising new breakfastlunch joint is a disaster periodtoken after waiting well over an hour for a table our waitress forgot our drinks and the food that came out was not what we ordered periodtoken the avocado toast was tasteless and not up to speed while the rest of the food was on par with a greasy spoon joint and not the modern fresh atmosphere suggested periodtoken i suggest we all give them time to find their legs commatoken train their staff commatoken and improve the quality of the potentially appealing menu periodtoken","8587":"why does this marsh not carry loose mushrooms like every other marketplace this marsh is always dark commatoken too periodtoken","8589":"im seriously picky about my breakfast  maybe because its my favorite meal of the day commatoken but its really hard for me to find an amazing breakfast periodtoken and cafe deluxe didnt fit the bill either periodtoken our waitress was a little cold to us when we came in commatoken but when a friend mentioned something about it commatoken she was apologetic periodtoken   we ordered coffee and orange juice commatoken but only the coffee made it out to us periodtoken so commatoken we reordered the orange juice and waited again periodtoken the orange juice tastes right out of a bottle commatoken really not worth it at all periodtoken  i decided on the deluxe scramble with broccoli commatoken mushrooms commatoken and chicken sausage periodtoken its a pretty big plate commatoken but overall just disappointing periodtoken i think the broccoli is actually broccoli rabe commatoken much more bitter than i expected and it really detracted from everything else periodtoken it was also more stem than florets periodtoken the chicken sausage was pretty sparse periodtoken theres just really nothing special going on here periodtoken  maybe breakfast isnt their strong suit commatoken so id be willing to come back and give lunch a try periodtoken their salads and sandwiches sound great periodtoken maybe ill be able to bump them up a star or more","8597":"im super disappointed with this place now periodtoken i went tonight for the first time since the new owners took over periodtoken there is zero ambience and it honestly feels cold periodtoken the white table linens do nothing to warm up the space and the sitting area with the couch is gone periodtoken the patios may be ok still commatoken but i just feel like the overall vibe was sucky periodtoken the wine selection is much smaller and i was super underwhelmed with the menu periodtoken its in my neighborhood commatoken but i think ill just drive to sashas for the experience im looking for periodtoken","8598":"place still doesnt seem to have improved periodtoken constantly low on all items to where if the 2 people in front of you happen to want the same thing you want commatoken then you have to wait for them to make more periodtoken come in too early or too late commatoken they have even fewer items and dont have the lights on periodtoken most recently commatoken i could tell the teriyaki chicken they were cutting for me was very pink and she still put it in the box periodtoken they seem to rarely ever have more than 1 person working the food commatoken and sometimes the same person is running back and forth between the food and ringing you up periodtoken i would stick to the higher volume mall locations","8602":"payette used to be my favorite brewery in the treasure valley periodtoken ever since the move to the new location commatoken the service of the wait staff is abhorrent periodtoken weekly commatoken my buddy and i meet up for a few pints and are disgusted by the snarky commatoken impatient attitude of the servers behind the bar periodtoken if you arent sure of what youd like to enjoy commatoken as there are so many awesome choices commatoken these guys get short and give you the eye roll periodtoken asking about the future of the old tasting room commatoken we were ridiculed by the server for paying it compliments in favor of the new locale for its quaintness periodtoken mike francis sort out your bar staff they are consistently alienating patrons and forgetting they work in a service industry i dont want to be relegated to just enjoying payette beer from the local grocery outlets but the new staff is a downer","8603":"the price does not reflect the quality of service or food periodtoken overall poor value unless youre 6575 and have that passive income locked down periodtoken then you probably dont care periodtoken","8607":"food was good periodtoken but everything else was a joke periodtoken management and staff decided to have a party off to the side of the restaurant periodtoken literally 15 people standing around talking and gossiping management commatoken servers commatoken and kitchen staff included periodtoken not only was it distracting commatoken the service was terrible periodtoken good food is only half of the equation and the fact that the management team didnt seem concerned that our bill got lost and just shrugged and walked back over to the party was the cherry on top periodtoken","8608":"this place is a joke yet is always doing business periodtoken go figure periodtoken  the place is just  full of the meatheaded idiots that i normally cant stand to be around periodtoken plus commatoken its always loud due to some moron playing some horrible music over the jukebox periodtoken   the only redeeming quality about this place is the fact that there are some good pool tables and quite a few televisions for watching sports and whatnot periodtoken   when i do find myself at bars commatoken its never at this place periodtoken","8611":"portions are extremely small  containers are teeny as well making it difficult to eat periodtoken im at a poke place in california right now where i know its common and i cant believe the difference in portions  the pricing is way cheaper here too for better size and quality periodtoken i really hope poke bowl makes some changes because im a huge fan of poke and there arent any other places in philly periodtoken","8612":"portion sizes are kinda disappointing for the price periodtoken many of the rice dishes are basically just some pan fried chicken breast smothered in sauce and served with plain white rice periodtoken the general tsos and teriyaki are decent commatoken but i find that the meat is often dry and rubbery periodtoken not really impressive commatoken but if you need a quick fix of cheap and spicy americanized asian food commatoken the 5 general tsos is hard to beat for value periodtoken the salads also offer pretty good variety commatoken but i wish the ahi tuna salads had large chunks of fish commatoken rather than the kindof ground up raw tuna that they last served it with periodtoken","8614":"i have no idea why this place gets high ratings periodtoken  its a food van thats permanently parked by a tent at the intersection of a road periodtoken  positives  they had a wounded warrior sticker on their window periodtoken  negatives  parking is terrible but you can find a space even when its a busy weekend night commatoken just dont expect to park in a straight line periodtoken  i had the hard taco and a burrito asada  they have the sonoran hot dogs commatoken ive never had one periodtoken  compared to california it is completely average and i dont have a high opinion of california periodtoken  its also a long wait commatoken not just to order but after you order commatoken which i wouldnt have a problem with if it tasted good periodtoken","8617":"my wife loves these place i could live with out it last time i was here a guy who handed me my gelato  said chow i dont know what he meant but i know what that means i think these place is a scam like pink berry  but of course women love these place i think is because they think its less fat then real ice cream  maybe it is  but to me its like the people that drink diet soda or light beer  periodtoken its all sugar  if it wasnt then why not post the nutritionalif any value on you r website","8625":"first i want to say that ive downgraded my review after having contacted the email address on the website and waiting a week periodtoken no reply commatoken no acknowledgement at all periodtoken  because i was hosting family from out of town two weekends ago commatoken the tuesday before our family event i reserved a table for 11 people on saturday night via yelp periodtoken we planned our day around this commatoken knowing wed need to be in no libs by 7 periodtoken  i received a phone call to confirm at 1230 commatoken as well as a text message and an email periodtoken three confirmations periodtoken when i called around 3 to add one more person commatoken i was told that it wouldnt be a problem but they appreciated the call periodtoken lo an behold commatoken after the 12 of us piled into ubers and arrived commatoken laden with a few sixpacks and a bottle of tequila commatoken we were told there was no reservation it must have been lost periodtoken we spoke to a woman who identified herself as the manager commatoken and with a shrug and an apology commatoken she turned us away periodtoken  i couldnt believe this periodtoken first of all commatoken we had planned our day around this and spent money and time on transportation to get to our reservation that had been thrice confirmed periodtoken secondly commatoken i was extremely embarrassed to tell my family that the nice dinner we were looking forward to and that i had planned had been cancelled without our knowing it periodtoken finally commatoken to be turned away without any sort of compensation commatoken a coupon off a future visit commatoken anything to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience commatoken was unacceptable periodtoken  i am surprised and disappointed by this periodtoken as i mentioned in my previous review commatoken i had always had a great experience at this restaurant periodtoken at this point commatoken i have no plans to return and i certainly will never make a reservation for a large group again periodtoken","8626":"the good  service is fantastic friendly commatoken competent commatoken fast  view from the outside tables is wonderful  inside tables are fun  clam chowder was pretty good  the bad  the rest of the food was downright bad  prices are really high theyd be fine if the food was good  we left both hungry and feeling taken  when we visit sb in the future commatoken well find somewhere else to eat periodtoken","8629":"good food commatoken very disappointing customer service periodtoken hired them for a corporate catering order for a large party that was several hundred dollars periodtoken delivery contact was 45 minutes late with no apology periodtoken upon receiving my receipt from a member of the staff i replied politely with my concerns and never received a reply periodtoken will not be ordering catering from here again periodtoken","8636":"i think the space is cute and ive been to the location in soho periodtoken  now im strictly an espresso drinker and well periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe espresso just wasnt very good periodtoken  maybe it was an off saturday periodtoken  i dunno periodtoken  but it tasted burnt  like borderline starbucks quality periodtoken  thats not very good periodtoken","8640":"from the stale bread and burnt breadsticks in the bread basket commatoken to the lackluster cioppino commatoken to the burnt tasting  roomtemperatureobviouslynotdecaforwhyamistillawakeat330amcoffee commatoken to the server who spent more time checking out his tips from other tables and obviously trying to upsell and pander for a bigger tip than providing actual service commatoken to the loud interior commatoken to the mousse that was so thick and heavy that it was practically pudding commatoken this restaurant only earned a couple of stars for two reasons periodtoken the cioppino had very good seafood scallops and the tiramisu was light commatoken delicate commatoken and the perfect amount of sweetness periodtoken  however commatoken the flavor of the cioppino at brophy brothers is far superior periodtoken dont waste your time here  dinner took 2  12 hours commatoken or your money periodtoken if youre in the mood for italian commatoken go to olio e limone or ca dario periodtoken","8641":"we enjoy blimpie and dont mind the walkin experience at this location commatoken but the drivethru is awful they had to ask us for our order three times and it took over 20 minutes to leave with our order commatoken which they still messed up periodtoken this isnt the first time we have had experiences with a super slow drivethru here periodtoken dont risk it if you are in a rush periodtoken","8643":"it is a bad taco bell commatoken poorly made food periodtoken luckily i live close so i eat it when i get back commatoken but for those who eat and drive never go here commatoken its also not that great tasting","8649":"2016 event commatoken less than 10 chicken wing vendors to sample from periodtoken the gun shooting and the yellow tape pretty much dampered the mood so part of it was closed off periodtoken i go to this wing fest every year but this year was a dissppointment periodtoken wasnt bad but it wasnt great periodtoken ","8650":"ive gone to this starbucks two days in row and the service was terribly slow periodtoken ive never had to wait 10 minutes plus for a black tealemonade periodtoken it was 9am and not too busy periodtoken not sure if i hit two days in a row where they were training commatoken but it was snails pace slow periodtoken","8664":"terrible bar service and attitude in the upstairs bar on sunday evening periodtoken  server was great and food ok but bar tender no thanks periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8666":"the was a reason why this bk was practically empty when i stopped in for a quick breakfast the other day periodtoken    the biscuit for my sandwich was hard and too small to enclose its contents periodtoken  it appeared to be a tube biscuit that had been made earlier and left in the open air to dry out commatoken and then microwaved just before sale periodtoken  it rehardened quickly and was a crumbly mess to eat periodtoken  just not very good commatoken despite the fact that the rest of the ingredients seemed fresh periodtoken    given the competition across the street commatoken it is difficult to see how this place survives periodtoken maybe their burgers are better commatoken but i wont be back to find out periodtoken","8667":"i eat alone all the time and here it was just like commatoken way to make me feel awkward they even wanted my extra chair instead of taking one from another table that was empty but whatever commatoken i was nearly done at that point periodtoken like commatoken considering every server had on a lightning shirt commatoken and i was wearing a shirt for the evil opponent it makes me wonder if they were just being super lame periodtoken but considering there were large groups of people clearly speaking french getting nice service i just dont get why they acted so weird towards me as one person periodtoken  since i hadnt eaten all day commatoken i got a personal size 10 pizza with just jalapenos on it periodtoken it was pretty good commatoken but meh commatoken i almost wish i just overpaid for something in the arena periodtoken it would have been 3 stars if i hadnt been treated like a second rate customer for being one person periodtoken","8668":"others say the food is good and the menu looks enticing commatoken but the espresso shot was sour and foam was poor periodtoken  i mentioned info and hours on yelp were wrong periodtoken  the new owner bought it in june and is still working on things periodtoken   yeah periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenok commatoken wasnt that 6 months ago  good to great is about the details periodtoken  tamping commatoken steaming and setting proper expectations periodtoken    being an independent restauranteur is difficult periodtoken  bol periodtoken","8673":"i really wanted to like this place super hip ambiance but poor execution with the food and subpar service periodtoken pizza was undercooked periodtoken not sure how you mess up pizza to be honest periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenperhaps they were having an off night periodtoken my friend said her cocktail was good so it wasnt a complete failure periodtoken these elite members raving about this place are clearly sipping that koolaid","8678":"good beer selection usually but unfortunately they serve some of the more desirable beers in ridiculous goblets and dont switch when you request a pint periodtoken also service is pretty poor periodtoken sad periodtoken","8702":"from some of the reviews i had high hopes for this pizza but i guess tucson just doesnt know what good pizza is periodtoken  we ordered the large veggie and it was undercooked

periodtoken","8703":"picked this place after reading the reviews periodtoken  the main restaurant is nothing special commatoken imo periodtoken  the greek salad was pretty good commatoken but it was clearly the highlight of our meal periodtoken  neat commatoken kitcshy atmosphere commatoken but they pack you in and the food is overpriced periodtoken  the bakery attached is the only reason i would ever come here again commatoken so save yourself the overpriced meal and get dessert periodtoken  my wife ordered a meal and pointed to it commatoken but got something else served to her periodtoken  perhaps my rating is jaded by the atmosphere of area  people bugging you to take a boat ride commatoken visit their store commatoken etc periodtoken  its not my scene and way too touristy periodtoken  so commatoken i was looking for hellas to take me away from that and i feel like they tried to take advantage of us instead periodtoken  i will not be returning unless im with a group that insists on going here periodtoken","8705":"ok commatoken i was willing to give it another chance periodtoken i stopped by and i saw a better working team periodtoken even the manager was focused and involved periodtoken the place was much cleaner and spiffy periodtoken i ordered the 8 piece bucket original recipe periodtoken the worker pulled the pieces from what looked like freshly fried tray periodtoken i am thinking yay now why is the mash the obligatory side to have i asked to swap for spears and was told it was extra periodtoken i was like commatoken lets not spoil this good moment and i said ok periodtoken no biggie periodtoken got home and was ready for some good stuff commatoken so i thought periodtoken so far commatoken so good until i took a bite periodtoken did someone at kfc change the recipe i was looking for that original recipe bite and goodness periodtoken what i got was so bland it is like no one seasoned the chicken well ill be a damn periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and the consistency was like boiled chicken commatoken refried and breaded periodtoken quality control is clearly lacking here periodtoken kudos for the team commatoken meh for the chicken periodtoken publix fried chicken still the winner","8708":"very very very rude white older man behind the counter periodtoken cannot rate food because i walked out without buying anything due to his betterthanthou attitude periodtoken","8709":"my wife and i went here on our first date way back when commatoken so you would think we felt a kinship with this place commatoken but on the few times we have since been back it has never been more than soso periodtoken we went on friday with our kids because it was st patricks day commatoken but the irish stew was way overpriced and indifferent commatoken and lukewarm commatoken plus my sons had almost no meat in it commatoken and had been slopped over the bowl into the plate with the soda bread periodtoken the latter commatoken as well as now being soggy commatoken was almost nothing like real soda bread which commatoken for starters commatoken does not contain raisins periodtoken the stout i ordered was flat commatoken and the waiter tried to tell me this was normal for english beer i am english originally commatoken so can say with authority that this is not true periodtoken i ordered a replacement scotch beer that was spectacular commatoken and was not charged for the flat stout commatoken but still periodtoken and my wife ordered salmon cakes that contained little salmon and did not taste home made periodtoken in all commatoken got the definite impression they were phoning it in commatoken and we will not be back periodtoken","8713":"this place just misses the mark periodtoken their beer is not half bad but the atmosphere is awful periodtoken leaves a lot to be desired on the new orleans brewery scene periodtoken with so many options i wouldnt pick this place periodtoken cold as hell and full of children periodtoken fluorescent lights really kill the mood periodtoken and theres no liquor periodtoken","8716":"lunch periodtoken burger was just ok periodtoken i made the mistake of having too many toppings periodtoken i could barely taste the burger periodtoken go for the 8 ounce instead of the 4 ounce burger periodtoken service was mediocre periodtoken fries were small and bits and pieces periodtoken chipotle sauce was great periodtoken nice decor periodtoken basically an updated version of fuddruckers nofuddruckers had good burgers","8717":"had cha cha chow at food truck friday in tower grove park this past friday and i must say i am not impressed periodtoken  i ordered the lobster taco commatoken which came with cabbage slaw commatoken cilantro commatoken lemon dressing that just tasted like lemon and sour cream commatoken and 3 of the tiniest pieces of lobster i have ever been served periodtoken no joke commatoken they were about the size of a small cocktail shrimp tail or tiny crawfish tail periodtoken the taco was mostly cabbage and a fried flour tortilla commatoken which was actually the best part of the taco periodtoken and to top it off it cost either 8 or 9 commatoken i cant remember which periodtoken either way it was not memorable and was without a doubt the worst thing i had at food truck friday periodtoken  i might try them again to see if anything else on the menu can redeem this place but on value alone it was extremely disappointing periodtoken it took me about 2 bites to eat periodtoken and the flavor was just ok periodtoken the friends that were with me ordered the lobster taco also and we were all let down periodtoken","8718":"soo periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken my family came to eat here and they were going to order to go for me

still my order was ignored waiting to be bagged periodtoken finally bagged commatoken they gave me extra fries periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken oops on them periodtoken   burger was over cooked on the edges but pink in the middle periodtoken tasteless commatoken fries were okay periodtoken we were starving so we killed it periodtoken but this place needs to dance less and pay more attention to customers periodtoken","8724":"this was one of our favorite pizza spots in tampa periodtoken it was our go to periodtoken however commatoken the service is absolutely terrible periodtoken we were there last month and the server was so incredibly slow periodtoken it took her over 15 minutes to get our drinks periodtoken she only had 3 tables periodtoken when i asked for our waters commatoken she replied commatoken oh ill get them im waiting on his beer periodtoken what i couldnt believe she didnt just go grab the waters quickly periodtoken she was way more concerned about bussing tables and doing her closing work cleaning the floor commatoken wiping counters periodtoken what really upset me was the other server was running laps around her and saw us sitting without drinks commatoken yet never asked to help her or asked us what we needed periodtoken we were going to complain commatoken but by the time we got our food we just wanted to eat and get out of there periodtoken   last weekend commatoken we ordered delivery periodtoken we were quoted 30 minutes periodtoken our food didnt show up for 1 hour and 20 minutes when i called to check after 45 minutes commatoken the girl

told he wouldnt be back for 2 hours periodtoken when the order finally showed up commatoken it was fresh so i didnt make a big deal periodtoken but i was told the girl on the phone was new and very young commatoken and he wasnt even a driver commatoken theyre very short staffed periodtoken as a customer commatoken that isnt my problem periodtoken  i will say commatoken they did send a 10 off coupon with an apology note periodtoken i appreciated that periodtoken but commatoken we will probably never return to this establishment unless we order and pickup periodtoken the kitchen staff is rockin they just need much better service staff periodtoken","8739":"i would give a better review commatoken because ive had this before but tonight i walked into stank ass attitudes from the employeesowners periodtoken ice cream is good though periodtoken lol periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni mean i get it periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyoure on south street and prob see a ton of whackos but ummm helloooo customer service still needs to be given periodtoken and dont look at me crazy when my fat ass wants a extra topping irked at the moment periodtoken but just giving them the stank face back currently periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand not leaving periodtoken lol","8740":"apparently i seem to be missing something periodtoken the positives to this place is that is is small commatoken and quaint periodtoken a good place for a first date i guess commatoken when you are too nervous to think about the quality of your food periodtoken its also on a trendy commatoken upandcoming block in west philly commatoken so that might add to the popularity periodtoken the food was simply average commatoken the prices too high commatoken and service almost nonexistent periodtoken i was very disappointed in this place and wont go back periodtoken i went there for lunch and got to the point where i started to wonder if the waiter had forgotten about me commatoken and the other customers waiting periodtoken the soup was too salty commatoken the dumplings too doughy and without enough stuff in them to give them flavor commatoken and the chicken basil was too dry periodtoken the veggies just average periodtoken since i mentioned the chicken basil i should add it wasnt even what i ordered periodtoken i ordered the shrimp periodtoken i didnt say anything commatoken because a periodtoken i was really indifferent about which of the four veggie commatoken shrimp commatoken beef commatoken chicken i got commatoken and b periodtoken i didnt want it to be a hassle commatoken and i certainly didnt want the wait to be even longer periodtoken so i didnt say anything periodtoken at the end commatoken the waiter realized he gave me the wrong dish commatoken and took 10 off the chicken price periodtoken whatever periodtoken had he appeared while i was eating to either refill my water commatoken or ask me how my lunch was i would have said something and added commatoken no biggie commatoken just dont charge me the higher shrimp price periodtoken mistakes happen commatoken no problem periodtoken  the prices are a few bucks higher than what they should be periodtoken if this place was in some generic suburban strip mall commatoken i think most of the positive reviewers would trash this place commatoken but since it is in a hipster neighborhood people say its great periodtoken sort of like the seinfeld episode where george convinces attractive models that he once dated a nowdeceased fellow model and thus gets in the club periodtoken women looked at george and said well commatoken since he dated one of us he must be a stud periodtoken same deal here commatoken put a place in a cool neighborhood and somehow people think the food tastes better periodtoken  one last thing commatoken this place does not take credit cards periodtoken be warned periodtoken dont get how in 2014 restaurants dont take credit cards periodtoken","8749":"friends and i waited a month to finally get a reservation for a place so tiny that they should only do first come first serve seating there are maybe eleven tables each seating only four and two people to be completely let down by the food commatoken service and pretentious clientele periodtoken   the overpriced food was definitely not worth all the accolades and the only thing that stood out was the panna cotta on the dessert menu periodtoken   they apparently overbooked on the sunday five pm slot we reserved we were rushed through our meal resulting in disgruntled patrons who came for the next seating periodtoken the waitstaff on hand chose a passive commatoken uncommunicative approach to resolving the conflict commatoken making for a very awkward and unnecessary experience periodtoken   this is my first yelp review and i am putting in the actual effort to write one because this restaurant is lacking the professional and efficient management that they really need if they are going to continue to pass off cheap cuts of meat as four star quality periodtoken   its needless to say that we wont be back for seconds periodtoken","8750":"very disappointed periodtoken  went here for breakfast and there was no line periodtoken  we waited over 45 minutes for our food and mine came out cold periodtoken  no apologies from any staff commatoken who were unfriendly when ordering periodtoken  the pastries looked quite nice and were popular commatoken and they serve illy coffee commatoken which are redeeming factors periodtoken  i would eat here again if i were just getting a muffin periodtoken","8759":"although the service was top notch and the chips and salsa were delicious commatoken the main course was a little underwhelming periodtoken    in fact commatoken on the walk home commatoken i realized that although i havent grocery shopped in quite awhile commatoken i still could have prepared the same meal at home periodtoken    that was depressing periodtoken    it just seems like they are caught between being a snooty nolibs restaurant and a neighborhood mexican place periodtoken","8760":"i just paid 12 periodtoken50 for a caprese sandwich commatoken small soup commatoken and a wee bag of chips periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken no drink periodtoken are you serious not even a very large sandwich at that periodtoken i have got this same thing multiple times and it seems like it started at around 10 bucks after tax commatoken and suddenly its just to nearly 13 dollars periodtoken their pizza is alright to grab since i work across the street commatoken but never will i pay this much for an ok sandwich and soup again periodtoken i also just worked out the math here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken sammich cost 7 periodtoken99  1 for soup commatoken then assuming they charge for chips commatoken thats maybe another 1 periodtoken so 9 periodtoken99 periodtoken how the hell did i pay 12 periodtoken50 periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken twice in a row now periodtoken last time they just gave me a drink cup to make it even periodtoken","8761":"ive had better periodtoken theyre new so ill give them a pass this time periodtoken bowl was poorly put together and the staff lack professionalism periodtoken there should be some adult supervision and someone who can train them in customer service periodtoken","8762":"stopped here for the first time last week and was not too impressed periodtoken it was a friday periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwasnt too busy yet our food took forever to come out periodtoken i dont know if it was the kitchen or the waitress that was slow but the food came out cold periodtoken didnt taste bad commatoken but definitely had better periodtoken after we finished commatoken we had to wait another 15 minutes to get our check because our waitress was in the back of the restaurant stacking bottles periodtoken aside from that commatoken i did enjoy their chips and salsa but that was probably the only good thing from my experience","8764":"i had a big problem with my dc finishing her food before mine arrived commatoken when i mentioned it to the cashier she told me that thats normal because the salads come from a different part of the kitchen periodtoken","8767":"i have to tell ya periodtoken i was excited to get another food option near where i work on the northwestside periodtoken i didnt wait long to head over to five guys commatoken especially after i heard how good it was supposed to be periodtoken  it wasnt periodtoken  talk about a lame menu periodtoken burgers commatoken fries and i think a hot dog periodtoken not much else periodtoken i guess that wouldnt be bad if you were as decent as 96th street steakburger periodtoken but this place is not 96th street periodtoken not even close periodtoken i even thought it smelled a bit rank when i visited periodtoken not a good thing periodtoken smelled like the bathroom was backed up or something commatoken which doesnt make for an appealing lunch break periodtoken blah periodtoken  a quick look just now at their web site confirms it for me periodtoken even that needs help periodtoken and  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken looks like you have five options around the city in case youre wanting to try for yourself periodtoken maybe a different location will be better","8770":"typical starbucks quality food ok prices but this particular time service was super slow periodtoken we even had to remind them in the drivethrough of the cake periodtoken forgive them though","8774":"i had food there last week periodtoken my pizza i had was delicious and ice cream was good cotton candy with mini marshmallows periodtoken great atmosphere and location periodtoken the manager was constantly yelling at employees which makes it an awkward experience since you can see everything going on periodtoken it was kind of like gordon ramsey but way way worse because he was yelling for no reason periodtoken the staff is young and maybe the manager takes advantage of this periodtoken hopefully the owners do something about it because i can see the food failing if the staff is yelled at all the time periodtoken i wouldnt bring my family back because its stressful hearing the barking from the manager when youre trying to enjoy a meal periodtoken","8778":"lets be totally honest here commatoken this is drunk food commatoken that happens to be pizza commatoken happens to be hot and happens to be in the area your drinking periodtoken we got something pizza commatoken something pepperoni commatoken something cheese commatoken whatever i dont even know what we paid commatoken i think it was a medium commatoken i got heartburn or maybe it was the vodka periodtoken idk periodtoken pretty bad when your buzzed and it still ranks 2 stars periodtoken if your coming out of the vogue or any other establishment and you need pizza commatoken caveat emptor periodtoken","8781":"sorry but its just too damn hot in this place anytime ive gone there commatoken the side of the building is a garage door and its always up commatoken only 2 small ac wall units commatoken one aims at the band and the other one is at the cash register commatoken both at either end of the place commatoken so be prepared to sweat commatoken beer is 6 a pint commatokennot cold enough and yes they have a bad aftertaste","8785":"great food commatoken but received poor service by our waitress erica periodtoken  we sat outside and waited in gaps of 3040 mins before she came back periodtoken  recommend the food commatoken first visit was poor in service periodtoken  we tipped bus boy well because he checked to help a couple times and explained bbq sauces","8793":"the food always comes out fresh but expect to wait in the drivethru for at least 20 minutes periodtoken  steak n shakes have always been notorious for long drivethru lines but this is a little excessive periodtoken","8795":"i love pancakes and i had heard that the pancake pantry was the it place for pancakes in nashville periodtoken  far from it periodtoken   its very a trendy vandy thing to do commatoken but we wont be back periodtoken head to fido on the same block and you wont regret it and if youre ever in minneapolis commatoken go to the original pancake house for the best pancakes of your life","8798":"first off commatoken finding parking is a nightmare periodtoken  second commatoken although the name is catchy and cute periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the building is cute and trendy periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the food and coffee are mediocre at best periodtoken  we stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our anniversary weekend and were really disappointed periodtoken  our breakfast sandwiches were very greasy and salty periodtoken the coffee beverages were also very lacking periodtoken  its so hard to find a good coffee shop","8799":"presentation was put over authenticity periodtoken   quality was good but average at best taste periodtoken  service was quite slow commatoken waited a solid 20 minutes for our waitress to greet us and waited another solid 20 minutes waiting for our check periodtoken   this place is great if you dont really like mexican food periodtoken","8800":"we had the mussels and chicken sandwich commatoken and both tasted like nothing drinks were overpriced and not worth it either periodtoken would not recommend periodtoken","8805":"went there for the first time ever periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeneveryone brags about how amazing sprinkles cupcakes are so i had to have them  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokento my disappointment i wasnt happy periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenfirst the lady didnt put the cupcakes properly in the box and when i opened them soon as i walked out they were toppled over commatoken then i try pumpkin it had great icing but the cake part was dry  commatoken then im like let me give it another try  commatoken i tried the sprinkle one well to my disappointment the cake part taste like baking powder periodtoken i must say on a positive note the store was so pretty and the presentation of the cupcake was so nice ","8812":"this place used to be the best ever periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut recently commatoken it is not periodtoken the owner commatoken the fatherwas so friendly happy and just awesome love that guy but recently i have not seem him there periodtoken periodtokenand now the food is horrible  went

periodtoken  what happened to manager  commatoken the father commatoken that worked here he needs to come back periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8815":"not impressed periodtoken  we ordered for delivery which was timely commatoken but the pie arrived cold commatoken the cheese had slid over to the side and the crust def was not as good as down the shore periodtoken  the crust tasted like they had a hard time rolling it out and it was kind of rubbery commatoken it tasted like crackers or matzo or something commatoken it was very bland periodtoken  with that said commatoken had the pizza been hot commatoken the sauce is pretty good and the toppings though there was barely any sausage at all on the half of the pizza that we ordered were decent periodtoken periodtoken  i live in south philly and i just think that they need to do a little better considering the area  i dont think i would bother giving them another chance commatoken there are too many other places to try periodtoken","8816":"wow periodtoken 4 for a cup of coffee periodtoken the coffee was ok commatoken definitely not worth 4 periodtoken there are coffee shops nearby that have comparable coffee and better prices periodtoken the people were nice and the shop is cool commatoken but i cant justify spending 4 on a 16 oz periodtoken coffee periodtoken","8818":"this is my second time to cosi periodtoken i come to 30th street often periodtoken last visit i needed a quick dinner so stopped in for a sandwich periodtoken this time commatoken breakfast periodtoken   i was happy with the number of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu periodtoken the food is actually decent periodtoken i was really impressed with my breakfast wrap this morning and probably would get it againat a different location periodtoken   two problems the portions are very small and the customer service is horrendous periodtoken   i ordered the tbm for dinner and thought oh for 56 the half is plenty i feel like there was two bites and my sandwich was gone periodtoken my breakfast wrap was the same way periodtoken im not looking for a gigantic serving size commatoken but these portions are tiny periodtoken   both trips to this location the service was awful periodtoken when i came in for dinner i asked the lady how she was doing as i always do before ordering and she looked at me blankly and said what do you want periodtoken this morning commatoken different lady commatoken same response periodtoken when she gave me my number commatoken i wished her a good day and she said yeah periodtoken when my food came out i thought the gentleman said a totally different number and when i asked him what number he said he called my number periodtoken i apologized and he literally threw my bag on my table and walked away periodtoken no other words spoken periodtoken with the slogan be kind to each other cosi really needs to step it up periodtoken im not looking for some feel good smiles and sunshine place in the middle of downtown philly but goodness they could stand to improve their service periodtoken   i think ill likely stick to the convenience store for a quick bite and to the breakfast spot next door for hot food periodtoken","8820":"sorely disappointed periodtoken  ordered takeout on a friday night lamb  bison burgers w periodtoken sweet potato fries  vidalia onion rings periodtoken  everything was extremely bland commatoken no flavorseasoning whatsoever periodtoken the fried batter on the onion rings was a let down on first bite periodtoken sweet potato fries seemed that they were just cut  baked w a few scarce grains of salt periodtoken  the burgers were just periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensad periodtoken the best part were the sauces on the side for the togo burgers commatoken probably made by somebody who actually cares how their food tastes periodtoken  given the high cost for our low quality meal commatoken i do not intend on returning to this establishment periodtoken","8821":"hunger was running wild and hopes were high for something special upon finding pizza mizza periodtoken most of the time commatoken your pizza options at the mall are pretty much limited to sbarro commatoken so it was cool to find an independent pizzeria with classy wood paneling commatoken tvsaplenty commatoken and nice patio seating periodtoken the inhouse menu didnt include their appetizers those are only on the takeout menu for whatever reason commatoken but we settled in on a fine pie periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the pie was totally bush league periodtoken we received thin crust instead of regular as wed ordered periodtoken it was overcooked to the point that they cut the charred crust off of a few slices before serving it periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken super tacky periodtoken because the crust was so crunchy commatoken you couldnt fold these crustless slices without cracking them in half periodtoken it was pretty disappointing because they didnt hold back on the toppings commatoken and the thing smelled pretty fantastic periodtoken oh well periodtoken our server must have had a hot date commatoken too commatoken because the service went from prompt commatoken only slightly forgetful commatoken and notparticularlyfriendly during the early part of the meal to rushed and cold by the end periodtoken maybe they close at 8 pm sharp and we had overstayed our welcome commatoken who knows periodtoken anyhow commatoken i can get flawed pizza and underappreciation all over town periodtoken ill stick to woodstocks for a good pie periodtoken","8831":"they need to bring back the scale periodtoken the prices of the different size cups are not worth it periodtoken","8832":"i know these guys have a big following commatoken and i am new to this chain and wanted to give it a go periodtoken   i showed up at 1145a  periodtoken there are maybe 4 people in line at this time of day periodtoken   i ordered a small cheeseburger and small fries i wanted to start with something easy periodtoken    it took a nearly 15 minutes to get my food commatoken but i had high expectations so i did not mind commatoken plus they have those peanuts they offer to keep me busy periodtoken   the fellow serving up the food did apologize for my wait commatoken and it was nice that he noticed it took longer than a burger and fries should take periodtoken  fries a lot oily i have to say periodtoken  crisp is not a word that i would use to describe them periodtoken  plentiful they are generous with their fries portions   burger wow periodtoken it was so average periodtoken  a little on the dry side commatoken but it was a small burger periodtoken  i do not like chopped onions on my burgers periodtoken periodtoken i am old school and i like a slice of onion on a burger periodtoken periodtoken chopped is fine for dogs periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut not for burgers periodtoken    sorry guys periodtoken","8834":"convenient location periodtoken service varies periodtoken last time i went was fine commatoken but this isnt always the case periodtoken their hygiene procedures are not where they should be periodtoken i watched an employee make a sandwich commatoken handle the money commatoken and then begin on the next sandwich without ever taking off her gloves periodtoken subway pays min wage and the patels who own most of the nashville locations are very rude and treat their employees like dirt so its no wonder no one stays long periodtoken not to mention the only things that are actually fresh are the onions commatoken cucumbers commatoken and tomatoes periodtoken even their guac squeezes out of a bag periodtoken its all frozen just like any other fast food place periodtoken and they overcharge on beverages and its like 60 cents more for an extra piece of cheese periodtoken i most likely wont return periodtoken","8838":"tasty food commatoken small portions commatoken the ice cream is amazing periodtoken smaller portions for higher prices periodtoken the booths are the most adorable seats ever periodtoken my kids kept closing the curtains for privacy which was fun periodtoken the staff is what you would expect of this sort of place  sort of pretentious with that commatoken i wish you werent here wasting my time attitude periodtoken but commatoken what trendy place doesnt have this sort of staff anymore id argue the answer to that is very few periodtoken  my husband went out of his way to say commatoken i know you have a sundae gambler which means you get what you get but commatoken i want the what the waitress on her break is eating next to us periodtoken then commatoken received some godawful concoction instead that he couldnt return because the menu explicitly says sales are final on this commatoken and couldnt eat because it was basically every gross thing they had behind the counter thrown on some basic ice cream but still had to pay for periodtoken so you know commatoken dont seem excited to be there and maybe theyll treat you nicely periodtoken","8843":"this place is wayyy overpriced and the sushi isnt all that great periodtoken ordered the spider rolls tempura commatoken and an eel roll periodtokenservice was alright and nice setting periodtoken  ive had better at smaller sushi places such as  terryinn periodtoken i wouldnt bother coming here again periodtoken only reason was of the outside seating next to the fountain and because i live in walking distance periodtoken","8844":"for anyone who knows or really loves q commatoken this is not going to impress periodtoken overpriced and under flavored commatoken a ride to try some of the citys best mom  pops not far is worth it comparatively periodtoken location in south tampas townhome zone will keep it busy commatoken walking distance or an easy drive for many residents commatoken and its better and cleaner than jimbos commatoken though im not a fan of either periodtoken nevertheless commatoken it just doesnt burst with smoke commatoken spice commatoken or texturesensation that low and slow meat fans crave periodtoken for ribs commatoken ill mention first choice in brandon  simply unsurpassed and kc quality periodtoken yes worth the drive down the crosstown and mandatory attendance if going to bass pro periodtoken","8847":"every  once in a while its fun to play tourist in your own town periodtoken with that said commatoken the 65 price for a couple of crabs commatoken some melted butter commatoken six onion rings commatoken some romaine lettuce commatoken croutons commatoken dressing and a cup of bland chowder was not worth it periodtoken   for that price i kind of expect some semblance of service commatoken real silverware and maybe a cloth napkin periodtoken here you get to order at a window and wait for your number to be called periodtoken  your food is presented on paper plates with plastic forks and thin paper napkins that dissolve like tp so you need to use about 30 of them periodtoken   the view is always nice out here on the pier and thats what the two stars are for periodtoken","8854":"i am a frequent customer and have been for years periodtoken i have watched this place slowly deteriorate periodtoken to be fair i usually only have a coffee and sometimes a scone periodtoken the scones are fabulous  the coffee commatoken however commatoken is now barely drinkable periodtoken please commatoken please use a decent coffee your current brand is terrible periodtoken","8855":"doesnt live up to its potential periodtoken love the atmosphere and bar but i have never enjoyed a meal there been there at least 10 times due to it being nearby and friends wanting to go periodtoken  most recently commatoken my food was gross and misrepresented on the menu and the server who seemed really nice but also really busy trying to get out of there for the night did not ask to box up my virtually uneaten plate or ask if something was wrong periodtoken","8857":"there are better places in tucson to buy your alcohol periodtoken knowledgeable staff and a unique selection of wines and liquors can be found at plaza commatoken time market commatoken or rumrunner periodtoken   so what brings me to bevmo pretty much its just logistics periodtoken now that beverage house on broadway has closed commatoken its closest to my eastside home periodtoken","8862":"i went to this location for the first time just recently periodtoken the reason we decided to go to this location was because were given a gift card periodtoken i have been

also felt the service was very slow and disorganized periodtoken do not have an interest to visit spasso in media commatoken i feel there are better options in media periodtoken","8870":"i am surprised im giving this place such little stars because im a huge fan of all 4rivers locations ive been to in the past periodtoken their food is delicious commatoken staff is friendly and the food comes out quick periodtoken easily a 55 star experience periodtoken   and it wasnt much different this time periodtoken all 3 of those things happened periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbut i ordered the 6 chicken wings to dine in and they put it in a black styrofoam plate and the warmth of the wings literally burned several holes through the plate periodtoken the styrofoam material from the plate was melted into the wings periodtoken i feel like it should be common sense not to out scalding hot items in a black styrofoam plate periodtoken i read that the melting point of those plates are 464 degrees fahrenheit but it starts to soften around 80100 degrees periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhy would food cooked at a warmer temperature be served on those types of plates that material is carcinogenic cancer causing periodtoken   i was in such disbelief that i didnt even think to take a picture of the plate periodtoken i went back to the check out area and told the girl about it and she said shell get me some new wing in a different plate periodtoken and what happened they put it in the same kind of plate again i moved the wings to the big plastic tray before the wings made new holes on the plate periodtoken i just couldnt believe the obliviousness periodtoken   i know 4rivers is a good business and this was probably hopefully not something that happens often periodtoken i hope the reevaluate their serving method for hot items periodtoken ill be back to reevaluate my review commatoken eventually periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8873":"we used to come here once a week for breakfast and im thinking that we need to find a new place periodtoken the cinnamon rolls used to be the high point of the visit periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they used to be so moist and full of cinnamon goodness periodtoken now the outside of the rolls are so hard you could break a window with them commatoken have hardly any icing on the top and the inside doesnt have the beautiful swirl of cinnamon periodtoken its almost like the cinnamon rolls were made without butter or the cinnamonsugar mixture periodtoken my other favorite here used to be the pumpkin crumb muffins periodtoken boy when they get a new baker maybe we will come back periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","8876":"brought this in sierra vista at the outdoor market periodtoken  we brought the manicotti  and our friends brought the lasagna with extra sauce periodtoken   had it tonight and was very disappointed periodtoken  bland commatoken  it needed italian seasoning but we do  like the concept of no salt and organic periodtoken  just more  seasoning periodtoken","8883":"the crab cakes are more cake than crab which is disappointing periodtoken they are also served with honey mustard which is a bit strange periodtoken it overall made the dish way too sweet periodtoken the lobster chowder is tasty but it was served to me cold periodtoken by cold commatoken i dont mean refrigerator cold but it was cooler than room temperature periodtoken that was disappointing periodtoken the shrimp were okay but i was kind of done mentally by the time i got to them periodtoken","8885":"came here for sunday lunch periodtoken  decided to check this branch out since we love the chateau cafe in kenner periodtoken  place was halfway full periodtoken  it was 1130am but they still hadnt brought out the lunch

the food periodtoken  the sweet potato fries were ok commatoken veggie quesadillas were supergreasy commatoken hamburger patty was big and underdone commatoken and french fries were cold periodtoken

periodtoken i told her i would like to try two periodtoken she said i could only try one periodtoken  after sampling one flavor i got my yogurt and toppings periodtoken i think the topping choices were limited compared to other yogurt shops in the city periodtoken i took out my debit card and she proceeded to tell me there was a 5 periodtoken00 minimum for cards periodtoken i told her i did not have any cash periodtoken the total was 4 periodtoken70 after telling her i did not have enough cash she made an exception and took my debit card periodtoken  i asked for a glass of water while i was

the say cheesesteak commatoken which both my wife and i had commatoken was very underwhelming periodtoken the cheese itself was tasty commatoken but the meat commatoken for both of us commatoken was somehow both dry and fatty commatoken and just not a great experience periodtoken the menu has potential commatoken but the actual sandwich is disappointingly lackluster periodtoken i should point out that this is also the 3rd time i tried to eat there after hearing a great review from vegetarians commatoken maybe stronger for them and say cheese being noshows at different events they were scheduled for periodtoken not worth the effort to have finally tracked them down commatoken im afraid periodtoken","8910":"seriously tho commatoken why change the noodles from beef noodle soup to some cheap non chewy dry noodles","8917":"so disappointed periodtoken the breakfast burrito was not what i remember periodtoken it was flat and unfulfilling periodtoken lacking the girth of breakfast burritos of the past periodtoken underwhelming and approximately 23 oz lighter then before periodtoken gave two stars because the fries were plentiful on others meal and the fry sauce was decent periodtoken so sad that what they used to be known for is now non memorable and possible reason we have little intentions in returning anytime soon periodtoken","8922":"my first stop on my first visit to armature works commatoken and i was tempted by the chicharrones on their appetizer menu commatoken being the addict that i am to this cuban crispy crunchy juicy fatty delectable morsels of pure yumminess periodtoken if you have this weakiness like i do commatoken dont fullfill it here commatoken as you will be sadly disappointed periodtoken there was no crispy crackling skin commatoken and merely skinless seasoned pork belly dropped in to the deep fryer and fried to a dark brown color periodtoken the only things good were the sauces served with it commatoken which were a spicy habanero based one they called cuban fire water and an avocado sauce to cool the palate a tad periodtoken the servers were friendly and attentive commatoken for which i gave two instead of one star periodtoken with all the choices of food at this venue commatoken i probably would try others before i gave this one another try periodtoken","8923":"yesterday was our second time eating at this red robin location periodtoken the first time we ate at red robin and the service was a bit slow but we figured maybe next time it will be better periodtoken nope commatoken id say last nights experience was worse periodtoken  never got a refill on the fries periodtoken our server said hed bring napkins periodtoken never received the napkins and it took forever to get our to go boxes periodtoken it took about 15 minutes to finally get the to go boxes periodtoken the burgers are good although we tried some boneless wings and you could tell they were just frozen periodtoken not fresh at all periodtoken  our server basically forgot about us and didnt check back with us at all periodtoken my rating is based on the service we received mostly periodtoken the food could use some improvement periodtoken","8924":"i was happy about the hours of the place because i wanted to stop and grab a batch for the family and it was almost 8pm periodtoken however commatoken paying 18 for 6 cupcakes that were dry commatoken taste was definitely nothing special commatoken was a bit much periodtoken","8929":"the pancakes were pretty damn good commatoken but thats where the good ends periodtoken the line is absolutely ridiculous commatoken the service is slow when you finally do sit down commatoken and worst of all the coffee is absolutely dreadful and im pretty sure the fresh squeezed orange juice is just minute maid periodtoken what is it with breakfast places making amazing food and shtty beverages itd be like a 5star steak restaurant only serving pbr to go with their filet mignon periodtoken sure youre going there for the steak commatoken but would it really hurt to step it up in the beverages department yeah i get it commatoken the pancake pantry is known for its pancakes commatoken but i like a well rounded breakfast with good food and beverages periodtoken bottom line commatoken unless they step it up in the coffee department ill go elsewhere like fido or frothy monkey where the joe is good and i dont have to wait 45 minutes just to sit down periodtoken","8936":"i am torn periodtoken i liked the cafe commatoken the ambiance commatoken the people periodtoken i liked the soup but some salt commatoken pepper and hot sauce on the table would have been nice periodtoken maybe they were around but the soup was nice enough to live without it periodtoken  the sandwich commatoken premade and came out hot on the outside and refrigerator cold in the middle periodtoken it should be one or the other periodtoken portion was good commatoken flavour commatoken nothing special periodtoken  the coffee periodtoken i should have known better periodtoken i saw the bag of transcend on the bar periodtoken i prefer my coffee with out sugar and if it is a drip i take it black periodtoken i asked for a cappuccino periodtoken a nice flat capp commatoken colouring a bit dark commatoken with a bit of a leaf poured into the centre of a very attractive cup periodtoken i took a sip and knew immediately like most transcend coffee i have tried commatoken i would need to disguise the flavour periodtoken  off to find the sweets periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  next time commatoken i would have tea periodtoken","8944":"i was disappointed periodtoken i hated that very much because i was so excited to visit periodtoken my servers were overwhelmed for no reason because the place isnt big enough to bring an overwhelming crowd periodtoken i ordered the banana french toast and it  was basically slop on my plate commatoken not sure if thats the norm but i was not impressed periodtoken we did order a bottle of champagne which was 25 and came with unlimited juice commatoken i think it would have been better on both ends to simply charge a flat fee for bottomless mimosas periodtoken i spent the majority of my visit mixing my own mimosa commatoken not ideal for a saturday brunch periodtoken","8949":"being able to buy baked goods and pizza in the same place sounds amazing commatoken right i went in kermits for the first time today periodtoken i asked the woman at the counter what their popular items were periodtoken i like to ask the people that work at food establishments whats really good because 1 periodtoken they usually have so much enthusiasm about it and i think thats awesome and they could sell me anything at that point and 2 periodtoken theyre getting the feedback everyday and seeing what people are going crazy for periodtoken under her breath the woman mumbled commatoken the pizza is good commatoken our popsomethings are good periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenpeople like the ice cream sandwiches periodtoken no enthusiasm and barely audible periodtoken   im looking at the pizza commatoken the pop whatevers commatoken the little desserts and im like commatoken do i really want to spend money on this right now i get a slice of pizza and a flourless double chunk chocolate brownie and head home periodtoken the pizza was meh periodtoken honestly it didnt really look fresh non of the slices did and it was small and thin periodtoken i got the sausage and peppers which was flavorful but underwhelming periodtoken the brownie was tasty commatoken even better once i popped it in the microwave periodtoken","8950":"called to ensure theyd be open when we arrived periodtoken they said they would be periodtoken arrive before their stated closing hours periodtoken lights on commatoken but closed periodtoken two stars for bad service periodtoken","8953":"have been going to this panera for a steady week now being on vacation in this area periodtoken panera is a great place commatoken good selection commatoken good coffee etc however this particular panera has gone down in the quality of service commatoken the bagels were burnt for three days in a row and they still try to serve it to you wondering if youll notice  today we ordered a frozen mocha and it took all of 15 mins to get it commatoken and that was after going up to the counter to get the girl to stop talking to coworkers and focus on our order which she had messed up and had to redo periodtoken on a good note commatoken theres a very nice commatoken friendly lady who cleans up and always is smiling and professional periodtoken besides the good selection of food commatoken shes the best thing to this panera periodtoken","8957":"foods ok  commatoken sucks they dont have anything smaller then the sloppy monster slice sometimes its just too much also they claim to sell tarantini panzorottis  but they are always twice as big as a real tarantini and cheese never fully melted  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenstill searching for somewhere in or near medford that sells a real tarantini panzorroti ","8967":"after reading the very mixed reviews here i decided to roll the dice and try ghinis for breakfast periodtoken they have a very elegant website and that was part of my decision to go periodtoken i was underwhelmed periodtoken the ambiance was that of a minimall diner periodtoken plastic menus are not appealing to me but these were even dirty commatoken as was the table and several other tables in the indoor section i took a table in periodtoken there was noticeable crumbs and stuff on the floor as well periodtoken after watching my waitress cart a huge tray of food out to the patio the patio dining area fronts right on the parking lot for the mall commatoken and so did not appeal to me i decided the place was understaffed commatoken which may also explain the slowness and lack of coordination in the kitchen periodtoken i ordered there provencal special with added hash browns and a side of bacon periodtoken the hash browns were outstanding and well worth the 1 periodtoken75 additional  if i had a normal portion as it was i received what seemed to be a half order or a childs portion of the most enjoyable item on my plate periodtoken  the first thing i received was my coffee periodtoken i ordered my coffee black expecting to receive a french roast but the coffee was bland and disappointing periodtoken it came with  plastic creamers another disappointment in a french cafe periodtoken the mini baguettes that came with my breakfast were embarrassing they were similar to frozen diner rolls from the supermarket periodtoken really absurd when a socalled french bakery is sharing the same space with your french caffe periodtoken on the way out i bought a peach turnover on the bakery commatoken the crust was pretty good but there were only 3 tiny slices of peach inside periodtoken overall the food was ok commatoken overpriced commatoken and over hyped periodtoken i ordered the side of bacon because the website declared that ghinis serves thick sliced maple cured bacon periodtoken instead i received 3 slices of thinsliced oscar mayer or equivalent bacon for 4 periodtoken50 periodtoken  worst of all my breakfast arrived but no bacon commatoken i went ahead and started on my breakfast and by the time the bacon arrived i was almost finished  i should have sent it back and saved the 4 periodtoken50 but the waitress was nice and i just let it go periodtoken ghinis suffers from poor management commatoken excessive pricing commatoken poor decor and a slow kitchen periodtoken i was glad i checked it out but would not go there again commatoken hope this has been helpful periodtoken","8968":"i read that this was one of the top 20 ice cream parlors in the country periodtoken i went with high expectations periodtoken i was disappointed periodtoken evidently they are famous for their weird and off the wall flavors periodtoken i tried quite a few of them commatoken including lavenderhoney and chocolatecayenne periodtoken nothing was wowed me periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenat all periodtoken  me and 2 of my friends wound up ordering simple fruit flavored gelato periodtoken it was good periodtoken the service was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeneh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenokay periodtoken nothing spectacular periodtoken tastee freeze is just as good periodtoken","8971":"i am so disappointed to have to give red kings 2 a 2 star rating periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken all other past experiences here have always been great  the food was delicious and the perfect amount of spice  kick commatoken the griddle meats were fried to the perfect amount of juiciness and crunch commatoken and the cumin dishes were just mouthwateringly fantastic periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but tonight commatoken such fond food memories are gone periodtoken  pros  unusually quick service periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken normally there would be a 15 minute wait time for our food to arrive commatoken but tonight it was out to our table within 5 minutes of us placing our order not sure if the speediness contributed to the lack of flavor in our dishes  rice here is really good periodtoken they steam it with the right amount of water to produce perfect commatoken white fluffy rice grains periodtoken  they have a new menu that has a lot of pictures great for individuals new to szechuan cuisine   cons  cumin chicken had no flavor commatoken whatsoever the onions had more flavor than the chicken  boiled beef was way more oily than i last remembered it periodtoken i remember the dish being more soup base with chili oil as a flavoring agent andor enhancer periodtoken this time around commatoken it seemed the beef and cabbage were just sitting in a bowl of chili oil and no soup broth periodtoken  they have lowered the standard spice level they once cooked at periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  if this is the new quality standard red kings 2 cooks at commatoken i am greatly saddened periodtoken my housemates and i loved coming here for warming food during bitter commatoken cold nights periodtoken now commatoken we will have to look elsewhere for delicious commatoken late night eats within chinatown periodtoken","8972":"bottom line  over priced food unprofessional staff dirty atmosphere  great view of the ocean  you know the food is fresh  horrible service periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken no refills periodtoken periodtokenconstantly getting up to ask for things periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken even had to go to the waiter to pay periodtoken periodtoken i honestly felt like just leaving since they obviously didnt want the money periodtoken","8975":"usually pretty good but just ordered 2 large plain for the manic monday special and specified well done

periodtoken periodtoken","8979":"cold unflavored tacos periodtoken found a pad of butter in the rice of the commatoken which also was unflavored periodtoken this may of been on step above taco bell periodtoken i would consider going to chipotle commatoken i cant empathize how much i disliked this meal periodtoken","8987":"the coffee is pretty good periodtoken they have a good selection of pour yourself pots periodtoken the only negative is that the music is a horrible mix or top 10 and 90s rock periodtoken hardly a relaxing atmosphere to drink your coffee and enjoy a good book periodtoken","8989":"great atmosphere but the service and food was a comedy of errors periodtoken you order at the counter and there are no menus out so there is periodtoken i description of what each dish contains periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyou have to guess or ask the employee taking the order who doesnt know what is on it  we ordered a cheeseburger commatoken hamburger commatoken cobb salad commatoken tea and a latte periodtoken the cobb salad was good the bacon was a little funky and the pickled onions would have been better left in the jar periodtoken the service to the table was slow and the hamburger was cooked as a cheese burger so we sent it back and the staff apologized saying they had new kitchen help periodtoken 10 to 15 minutes later it showed up but had shrunk to a kids burger like a white castle burger and no fries periodtoken the fries did come out later periodtoken  so commatoken for coffee and pastries this place would be great but for lunch or dinner id recommend someplace else","8991":"so heres the deal commatoken the food is quite good commatoken but the way this place does business is pretty horrible periodtoken  if you live in nashville and someone special is visiting you commatoken or youre here for the first time commatoken then sure commatoken go to pancake pantry and stand in line for over an hour to get the food periodtoken but commatoken if youve already been there and you just need breakfast commatoken go someplace else periodtoken  as i said commatoken the food is great commatoken but the experience is pretty horrible periodtoken  ive been here several times once when we first moved here commatoken and then more times with outoftown visitors and every time im dumbfounded by how poorly the restaurant itself and the entire customer experience is managed periodtoken  last time we waited in line with my 82 year old grandma they said she could wait by herself in their tiny commatoken crowded entryway for us to work our way up in the line commatoken but refused to seat for over an hour in the cold commatoken then their uncaring host sat all 5 of us around a square 4person table periodtoken when i said why are you putting us 5 around a 4 person table instead of a bigger one he said thats how be do things periodtoken then commatoken as we watched commatoken he sat 3 people at a 6person booth commatoken then combined 2 4person tables for another group of 5 commatoken and the list goes on periodtoken  then after waiting in line for over an hour commatoken we sat there for half an hour until a very kind commatoken cute commatoken but unattentive woman finally came over and got our drink orders periodtoken which was extra strange commatoken because she walked passed us probably 25 times as we sat there next to the drink station commatoken then we watched as all the tables around us who had arrived after us got their food commatoken ate commatoken and left commatoken before we even got our drinks periodtoken then we sat around waiting for our food even longer commatoken as whole other tables had their order taken commatoken got their food commatoken and left periodtoken  when we finally got our food commatoken it was very delicious and we enjoyed it commatoken but we were done eating in about 10 minutes periodtoken then we stood in another line for several minutes to pay commatoken then we got the hell out there periodtoken  any business person can see that for the almost 2 hours that we were there commatoken we only spent about 10 minutes eating periodtoken  if they would clean up their act commatoken understand how customers actually want to interact with them commatoken implement new procedures to actually be efficient with their space commatoken tables commatoken seating commatoken and serving commatoken they could greatly improve the customer experience and allow those who love the food but hate the experience the chance to spend our money there more often periodtoken  also commatoken even if you only count the time we were at the table commatoken if they were to actually get on the ball commatoken they could have have probably 5 different groups of paying customers at that same table commatoken rather than just us paying once periodtoken  bottom line try it once periodtoken  after that commatoken unless you really love it commatoken or want to get up to be there when they open when the lines are shorter commatoken dont bother going back periodtoken the owner has a whole blurb on the menu about how they have such great quality commatoken well commatoken the food is great commatoken but the quality of the experience is horrible periodtoken","8998":"thanks to extremely poor customer service that is driven from the store management commatoken my wife and i go out of our way to avoid this starbucks periodtoken  things like no multiple orders in the drivethru commatoken even on a slow day periodtoken  there seems to be high staff

max for a meal periodtoken you have to pay for your drinks periodtoken the food is mediocre depending on where you go periodtoken now you cant use your points for the food court periodtoken council oak has great food but 9 dollars for a side of corn and their pricing is way overrated periodtoken the slots are good periodtoken tables have a lot of people who have no idea what theyre doing commatoken these are the 25 dollar tables because thats all they usually have periodtoken i went on a sunday morning at 7am and the tables were 25 periodtoken its the only casino except for the casino

other greek restaurants that have way better food in the area periodtoken this place gets busy during the weekends for no apparent reason periodtoken the service here is annoyingly bad each and every time my family chooses this place commatoken we always get the worst waiter periodtoken i recommend going somewhere else for better greek food periodtoken this place will not overly satisfy you commatoken unless you have never tried amazing greek food periodtoken","9008":"i really want to give this place a million stars periodtoken but commatoken the pizza was decent and the fettuccine alfredo was okay the chicken was dry and the sauce had just a bit of flavor periodtoken however commatoken the delivery person was so kind and the service was wonderful periodtoken it was an okay place to grab an early evening delivery meal after not wanting to leave my hotel room periodtoken","9014":"we didnt actually make it to dinner periodtoken they screwed up our reservation so badly commatoken we left periodtoken never a good place at that location commatoken unfortunately periodtoken","9015":"i really enjoy ccs coffee but every single time i go into this place the employees are miserable periodtoken yesterday was the first time i actually had someone smile while ringing me up however the person making my drink still looked like they had been sucking on a lemon bitter periodtoken i should also mention they are not usually busy when i go in there so its not being overwhelmed by the amount of work that makes them so rude periodtoken   wish they could get some customer service training because a smile and a thank you really go a long way periodtoken","9016":"the food ok commatoken the service bad periodtoken  walked in the the cafe with a friend and ordered 2 indie grilled cheeses pears with five spice and honey with gouda on rye bread  the guy taking our order looked confused as to what he was supposed to be doing periodtoken  i also ordered a chai which he completely forgot about periodtoken  the computer wasnt working so he told us to order at the bar periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken10 min later the bartender shows up and just laughed and said what the hell is a chai periodtoken periodtokenand sent us back to the cafe periodtoken  we finally did get our sandwiches btw commatoken no gloves used after a bit periodtoken  they were good commatoken a little too overpowering periodtoken  could use some sort of salty or savory element periodtoken","9020":"we came here around 1230pm and there wasnt much to choose from periodtoken they

new sisinlawtobe had the italian omelette commatoken which was just ok periodtoken   the service was periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken pretty atrocious periodtoken it took forever to get our food periodtoken they mixed up part of our order periodtoken and in general it seemed as if the two servers were confused and forgetful as they scurried around periodtoken they were nice

on top of the toilet for those that need assistance sitting down and standing up periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken which is nice for those that need it commatoken but gross for everyone else commatoken as that is the first thing you see when you open the bathroom door periodtoken  plus they are dog friendly  we had our two pups with us on the patio commatoken and they brought out

seasonings commatoken they  also provide 2 small side containers of a clear hot chili pepper mix commatoken and a cream dipmaybe its yogurt i dont know periodtoken  i also skip the dipstry them but they dont help with the meal periodtoken the blackened crispy pitanaan is hard to chewover crispy and does not really go with anythingits not stale but it is dried out commatoken and burnt so it is discarded periodtoken  the salad which is some lettuce commatoken tomatoes commatoken and red peppers and white onion are drizzled with a lot of oil commatoken it lost its crispy freshness and reminds

offer are fairly plain and uninspired periodtoken the guacamole was pretty good periodtoken the best thing about this place from what i can tell is the bar periodtoken the mixed and frozen drinks are impressive periodtoken the decor is quite fun and entertaining periodtoken other than some work on the menu commatoken my only suggestion is that they improve the lighting in a few of the main dining areas periodtoken its stark and a little harsh periodtoken fun pendant lights a cheap fix would do wonders to make for a more inviting and intimate dining experience periodtoken definitely a great happy hour venue periodtoken","9049":"awful awful smoke in food court and everywhere we went periodtoken wasnt very impressed with atmosphere even in non smoker section either periodtoken food in food

you one ranch to like 10 pieces of wings periodtoken i had hot wings and i love to eat my boneless wings and drench them in ranch sauce so i was angry that they would not give me any extra ranch sauce periodtoken i had to pay almost 2 bucks for one sauce when i could go to the dollar store and get a whole bottle for like 1 periodtoken i was disappointed because i had high hopes for this place based

periodtoken price is reasonable commatoken needs more seating periodtoken","9105":"came here recently for karaoke and was pretty disappointed with my overall experience commatoken especially the food periodtoken  on entering the restaurant commatoken there is a small dining room and they lead you up some sketchy steps to where the karaoke rooms are periodtoken in the room commatoken there was a large table surrounded by seats and a screen in the front with a computer for picking the songs periodtoken   the service was pretty slow and it took a while to get a server in the room to order our food and drinks periodtoken the menu was  periodtoken periodtoken interesting commatoken definitely not like the normal szechuanchinese food we were used to periodtoken it was also a lot different than the menu we had seen online periodtoken like a lot different periodtoken the menu online has a huge variety of food items commatoken most of them recognizable periodtoken the menu we were given had bacteria soup and dishes with blood periodtoken periodtoken it was like from a bad horror movie periodtoken im not sure why there was such a discrepancy periodtoken they did have some entrees that we recognized and those were what we ended up ordering periodtoken   once we ordered commatoken the food came out very fast commatoken like so fast that i think they probably have ready made food and they just warm it up when a dish is ordered periodtoken it tasted like that too periodtoken periodtoken pretty terrible overall periodtoken the scallion pancakes were greasy and lukewarm periodtoken the cashew chicken was the same plus was flavorless periodtoken the fried rice was completely flavorless and looked like frozen rice you would microwave at home periodtoken the dan dan noodles were oily and gross commatoken not spicy at all commatoken and were lightyears away from the han dynasty dan dan noodles periodtoken the beef with broccoli and general tsos were fine commatoken but still not on par with standard chinese delivery food commatoken which i think is not that great to begin with periodtoken the best dish of the night was the spicy fish commatoken which at least had some flavor and was cooked nicely periodtoken its the only dish i actually went back for seconds periodtoken most of the other food i left on my plate after trying a bite commatoken even though i was starving  the karaoke is fine and our group had fun with that periodtoken the pricing is reasonable and was about 2530 a person for the entire night periodtoken   im not sure why a lot of the reviews are positive periodtoken periodtoken maybe i went on a bad night either way commatoken i wont be finding out because you would have to pay me to eat here again periodtoken","9106":"ive had items from this bakery a few times periodtoken  the pies commatoken while pretty on the outside commatoken are not good when actually cut periodtoken  the cherry pie commatoken especially commatoken is waaaaaaaaaay too soggy periodtoken  they either need to precook the fruit commatoken to get the water out commatoken or add some sort of thickener commatoken like corn starch commatoken to the filling periodtoken  i cut into the pie and the filling just started pouring out of the pie into the empty space that the first slice had left periodtoken  continuing like that to serve guests was actually quite a mess and pretty disappointing commatoken given that the pie comes from a bakery periodtoken  because of the overly wet filling commatoken the bottom of the crust is incredibly soggy periodtoken    a guest had brought 2 berry pies from village bakehouse to a dinner party i was hosting commatoken and the same thing happened with both pies periodtoken  i thought my experience was perhaps an anomaly commatoken but it turns out its par for the course periodtoken  we also purchased some macarons and did a taste test of these with ones shipped from a ny bakery and therefore were at least 2days old periodtoken  the ny macarons won hands down with my gueststhey said the village bakehouse ones were dry and tasted very old commatoken and i agree periodtoken  they must be serving macarons that are at least a few days old periodtoken  not good periodtoken","9108":"i dont know what the hypes about commatoken this reminds me of the story of the emperors new clothes periodtoken yes the place is crowded but i think its more of a place for usf students and teens to hang out at one of the four tables periodtoken the ice cream or ice milk is so bland commatoken i thought that is tasted like frozen milk periodtoken the toppings were cute but thats it periodtoken we had thai tea and lychee and also the banana chocolate combo periodtoken both were sub par periodtoken im sure their successful but ive had better ice cream at jeremiahs commatoken dq and cold stone which has a similar concept periodtoken the show is hibachi style commatoken lots of chopping but at the end of the show it leaves you empty periodtoken i wish that i could give a better review commatoken but periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i gave them 2 stars commatoken one for

at best it was ok commatoken at worst it was ok periodtoken went here with a gaggle of people periodtoken  lets see commatoken ill just list what was had commatoken what was good commatoken ok meh periodtoken nothing was great periodtoken  mushroom soup was good seafood bisque was good scallop appetizer was good commatoken but pricey for the plate periodtoken tuna polke nothing extraordinary or even worth while to order again periodtoken  entrees beef taco a complete fail periodtoken small commatoken dried out meat commatoken terrible meatloaf  a horrid dried out saw dust like lump of coal sirloin  reportedly good although very pricey fig salad  reportedly meh one other entree had by a guest stated it was pretty good  service was meh commatoken seemed unprofessional and could have used more training periodtoken it wasnt due to a lack of effort commatoken but so many common sense things were missed periodtoken for instance commatoken no water was offered commatoken plates being passed over our heads commatoken dirty dishes not removed until asked commatoken dirty spoon dropped off plate and landing on a guest and the bus person mumbling something of an apology periodtoken hmm come to think about it commatoken no the service was not good or managed correctly periodtoken of course we over tipped periodtoken  total for 5 including tip and a round commatoken 250 which was entirely too much for the over all experience periodtoken on the level of an applebees commatoken but priced way over periodtoken  fatty says swing and miss periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9112":"so many people i know spoke highly of this place but i wasnt impressed periodtoken  i thought it was very expensive and the food was average periodtoken  their shakes tasted

periodtoken  the past couple if times weve come here the service was half a periodtoken i was constantly having to request to have our drinks refilled periodtoken the lastime we were here they had no silverware commatoken  the lettuce for our salads was brown on the edges and my wifes burger had the wrong sauce on it which was spicy periodtoken please get it together","9114":"stopped in yesterday for lunch periodtoken very busy at 100 i grabbed a seat at the bar commatoken but wasnt there for the lunch buffet commatoken though apparently most everyone else was periodtoken there appeared to be 2 servers and one host available for the entire restaurant commatoken which was quite crowded commatoken but not to capacity periodtoken i started with a spinach appetizer while i took my time to peruse the menu periodtoken when the server finally returned commatoken i asked for an order of toro and an order of uni shed told me shed have to see if they had any periodtoken she returned quickly commatoken only to to advise no commatoken they had neither periodtoken she said they were seasonal periodtoken ok commatoken then maybe that could be noted on the menu i didnt care for the spinach appetizer the long thick stems were attached big ones commatoken were not talking baby spinach and i could handle that commatoken but didnt at all care for the sickly sweet sauce that was pared with it periodtoken i was expecting more of a peanut sauce commatoken shame on me for not knowing the difference periodtoken i are less than half of the spinach goame appetizer periodtoken   perusing the menu was a chore commatoken since many of the rolls are either deep fried or contain fried items periodtoken i typically dont like anything in my rolls to be fried commatoken so at least half the the menu items would be off the list periodtoken   i ordered a spicy tuna hand roll next periodtoken there were three pieces of nigiri tuna within the roll commatoken with a splat of very tasty spicy sauce on top periodtoken also included was a slice of avocado and some cucumber periodtoken sadly commatoken the rice was not evenly distributed on the nori commatoken so literally the bottom 1  12  of the cone were empty   just the nori periodtoken most times when ive had spicy tuna the tuna is chopped and mixed with the sauce commatoken but not always periodtoken served this way commatoken it was much harder to evenly distribute the spicy sauce to all the bites periodtoken some were very spicy commatoken some not at all periodtoken i unwrapped the roll to try and redistribute the rice and sauce and was a little more successful commatoken but feel its a shame i should have to do this with a 5 hand roll periodtoken really you cant even put the rice to the bottom of the nori    i then ordered commatokenagainst my typical preference commatoken  a roll with tempura shrimp  avocado periodtoken it was tasty commatoken but the pieces were very very large periodtoken i ate half of that commatoken as i mentioned that fried anything in rolls really isnt my style periodtoken finally commatoken  finished with a sunset somethingorother roll periodtoken that one was the best commatoken fresh salmon and tuna in very nice portions inside commatoken and the finished that happily periodtoken   the server was adequate commatoken given how many patrons she had to cater to commatoken though my water was completely empty and i had to flag her down for a refill periodtoken however commatoken when seated at the sushi bar commatoken i was forced to look at the dirty restaurant equipment commatoken with the back stainless wall caked in splattered grease periodtoken the health food score in front showed the restaurant received a respectable 89 commatoken but i cannot see how based on what i saw yesterday periodtoken the floors are worn commatoken servers overworked commatoken and menu advertises items they do not carry periodtoken ive been to more than 30 sushi restaurants in and around nashville and the immediate area periodtoken there are many restaurants less busy commatoken with much better food and much more reasonable prices than rusan periodtoken   you wont catch me at this one again periodtoken sad if this is all the gulch has to offer","9116":"the most disappointing froyo i have ever had the misfortune of consuming periodtoken selection of yogurt was slim periodtoken there were many topping options but the most basic commatoken obvious choices were absent periodtoken i had the original tart and salted caramel periodtoken periodtoken salted caramel was flavorless periodtoken original tart was almost too tart commatoken lending to a spoiled taste periodtoken i actually felt bad giving a few spoonfuls to my dog periodtoken i wont be returning periodtoken","9118":"i used to absolutely adore this place commatoken but as the saying goes do or do not commatoken there is no try periodtoken  first off commatoken the poutine used to be awesome spread out on a plate the fries were evenly coated in gravy  you would hit cheese curds in the pile periodtoken it was great periodtoken now commatoken however commatoken it was served in a bowl periodtoken the bottom fries were dry  there werent cheese curds so much as a large cheese glob on top periodtoken  the salmon was my favorite thing on the menu periodtoken i would drive down from phoenix for their pan seared salmon  red quinoa periodtoken they took it off the menu periodtoken i get it commatoken things change periodtoken no hard feelings periodtoken the fish special tonight was halibut on red quinoa with the same balsamic reduction my good old salmon used to have periodtoken woot im up for that  i shouldnt have been periodtoken the halibut was criminally over cooked periodtoken dry as the desert it was being served in periodtoken also commatoken they were either out of quinoa or the server had screwed up the special commatoken because the dry fish was served atop flavorless risotto periodtoken   honestly commatoken the atmosphere was still lovely commatoken the service was still the alright as it has always been periodtoken maybe a 3 star night periodtoken however commatoken the bitterness of expecting magic  getting applebees if theres such a thing as a 30 applebees dish was a stars worth of disappointment periodtoken","9119":"food was fine but service was terrible periodtoken 4 people  2 couples and dinner almost took 2 hours periodtoken ordered an appetizer specifying that i would like it out first periodtoken over 25 minutes later commatoken app comes out with the food periodtoken than we dont see our server again no commatoken would you like another drink etc until he brings our bill periodtoken 20 minutes later commatoken he comes back and we ask for a split bill and he responds he can only do it down the middle periodtoken we wont be back periodtoken","9120":"first time my wife and i dined there periodtoken it was last

salmon periodtoken the linguine was fairly greasy and not very tasty periodtoken i ate 25 and took the rest home i didnt eat eat later periodtoken the salmon was good periodtoken i guess i was having bad luck the creme brulee was nice periodtoken i noticed that i was charged for french fries the waiter forgot to serve us commatoken it was taken off periodtoken  all in all a fair but not good dining experience periodtoken 2 glasses of wine commatoken appetizer commatoken entree commatoken desert and 2 coffees came to around 80 without a tip periodtoken limited menu periodtoken ill go somewhere else next time periodtoken  i gave it 2 stars but it should be 2 12 stars periodtoken","9122":"its passable food periodtoken probably more of a 2 periodtoken5 stars type joint periodtoken the place is nice and the staff is nice also periodtoken the food was edible but nothing special periodtoken   i felt the chicken was of relatively low quality and it had way too much seasoning to the point where you could almost not even taste the chicken periodtoken the catfish also was not great overcooked and dry periodtoken id stay away from here and try other places periodtoken","9126":"i had really high expectations for this bakery since im a pastry chef myself periodtoken they seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad periodtoken we arrived at 1045 on sunday but there was no sign of life periodtoken we thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11 periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenkind of odd for a bakery periodtoken we had the blueberry hand pie periodtoken it was good but probably not worth 6 periodtoken50 periodtoken  no espresso drinks but they had drip coffee periodtoken we will come back again in the future when they arent so new periodtoken","9127":"my family and i stoped here on our way home at the end of our vacation we loved the building and decor of this brewery however when we went to get a growler of beer we were very frustrated every beer we loved we were told that they cannot put those into the growler  basically they were selling us their version of budweiser beer periodtoken second the growler was 65 commatoken holy cow by far the most expensive we have seen to us they were selling the growler not their beer they were like here buy this amazing growler with our cheap ass beer lol  their food was nothing special either it looked pretty but nothing crazy to the taste worst money weve spent on a meal all vacation needless to say we will most likely never come back to this brewery ps the mac and cheese is delicious","9133":"okay food commatoken but extremely dirty always ask employees to wipe down tables and booths","9134":"not impressed periodtoken  the burger patty was very thin and over cooked periodtoken  you are mainly eating a ton of bread with their burger periodtoken  theres definitely better options for a great burger in the area","9135":"i hope this gets back to the owner because they have two restaurants here in woodbury and i like to support the small businesses here in my town periodtoken i paid over 12 for a salad from both of their restaurants commatoken which is fine when the salad is good but that was not the case periodtoken i ordered one from their restaurant called gia ninas about a month ago and then one today from woodbury station cafe periodtoken both salads were from a bag periodtoken absolutely disgusting i could smell the preservatives as the waitress put the plate down in front of me periodtoken how on earth do you own a restaurant and feel its okay to serve bagged salad never again periodtoken","9138":"the food here is good and fresh and i have no complaints so far periodtoken  it is a little pricey periodtoken periodtoken for instance last night i got commatoken  a gyro commatoken a small smoothie and a side of dolma and it was almost 19 periodtoken wow periodtoken  and they charged me  75 cents for extra sauce on my sandwich periodtoken  really  it takes me about six months  between experiences commatoken  before i am willing to give this restaurant another try because i truly like the food   i always receive bad service periodtoken  last night was no different periodtoken   i even geared myself up before going in periodtoken periodtoken positive  commatoken smiling commatoken polite commatoken  ordered without hesitation  periodtoken periodtoken and all looked good periodtoken periodtoken  i was going to get through my experience without a problem periodtoken periodtoken    so  i  placed my order and waited and waited and waited  sat and read emails and texted for about 12 to 15 minutes   and then i notice that my order is just sitting there waiting to go but they havent made the smoothie because they rather keep taking orders  commatoken cooking orders commatoken and ringing up the cash register periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and because i dont want my food to get cold  commatoken i go to the register hoping my presence would trigger a recollection that i had an order pending periodtoken  the servercashier asked if i needed something periodtoken periodtoken  i said i see that my order is ready periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken just need the smoothie periodtoken  smiling  he said well he hadnt got to that yet periodtoken periodtoken the other person in the store continues to make all of the orders that came in after me periodtoken periodtoken and the cashier keeps helping people and taking orders periodtoken     then after hes helped everyone in the store periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken he starts making my smoothie without washing his hands periodtoken  health regulation that after you handle money commatoken you wash your hands before handling food  and i let it go periodtoken periodtoken   and get my semiwarm food and walk out  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   funny thing periodtoken periodtoken its the best experience i had there and the last for me  all of the other times were worse periodtoken periodtoken    bottom line   good food commatoken  terrible service and pricey periodtoken   would i go there again  never","9139":"the food was okay commatoken nothing spectacular periodtoken the service commatoken however commatoken was not good at all periodtoken our waiter was pretty much mia for most of the evening commatoken and the few times we saw him in the dining room commatoken he didnt come close enough to our table for us to wave him down commatoken and then he was gone again periodtoken in addition to our alcoholic drinks commatoken my friends and i asked for water periodtoken we got our one glass of water each commatoken but that was it periodtoken no offers to refill commatoken nothing at all periodtoken call me crazy commatoken but i like water with mexican food commatoken especially if its spicy or hot periodtoken","9140":"so i dont know why but i wanted meatballs periodtoken so i came to wages and ordered a medium meatball periodtoken not only did i only get 3 meatballs but it was like 4 dollars periodtoken there was room to add more obviously periodtoken","9141":"i wanted to love this place  the yelp reviews were good and i was totally craving fried chicken today periodtoken  well commatoken first of all the potato salad was delicious and i wouldnt change a thing periodtoken  great balance between savoury and sweet commatoken with the seasoning and pickles in harmony periodtoken  now to the chicken periodtoken  it was indeed super crispy like others have said despite being delivered in a plastic bag but unfortunately it just  wasnt very flavourful periodtoken  it was also overcooked periodtoken  i usually privately will eat all the crispy fried bits off of a good fried chicken but i was not tempted to at all with this  in fact i avoided it where i could periodtoken  the skin was also oddly flavourless periodtoken  the chicken itself was stringy commatoken the batter was cooked too hard leaving it slightly burnt in flavour with no other flavours but overdone periodtoken  too bad commatoken it looked fantastic periodtoken  normally i also wouldnt be mad that a 6 piece pack contained 5 dark pieces and only 1 premium white cut as i prefer dark commatoken but regardless of part commatoken this was over cooked commatoken bland commatoken and stringy periodtoken  the gravy also oddly tasted like it was beef instead of chicken based  not into it periodtoken  wouldnt order any of it again but the potato salad but i cant ever see myself just ordering potato salad from somewhere periodtoken  would largely not recommend for their classic crunchy fried chicken periodtoken","9143":"first timer periodtoken ordered their turkey chili which was great periodtoken had flavor periodtoken also ordered their turkey provolone panini which was the most unappealing in taste of any sandwich i have eaten out periodtoken the turkey had a gamey taste to it and the entire sandwich was hard to chew and bite off even periodtoken  the price was more than i usually pay for lunch periodtoken compared to other establishments in this neighborhood  commatoken not worth it periodtoken i will attach pictures of the sandwich periodtoken i only ate half periodtoken it was not worth the effort to chew periodtoken  i wanted to like this place but it did not live up to the hype on the menu periodtoken","9148":"i was excited to try this place but i was disappointed periodtoken its a tourist trap with food thats borderline ok periodtoken the lobster bisque is ok commatoken a little on the salty side periodtoken the shrimp tacos  seafood pasta were so bland  the crab cakes were on the dry side periodtoken im not sure if we just ordered the wrong dishes but i definitely missed out on what the other yelpers were raving about","9153":"went here for lunch based on some of the reviews here periodtoken  i was not impressed periodtoken  i ordered the bento box with teriyaki beef periodtoken  the soup tasted like salt water commatoken the fried rice flat out sucked periodtoken  how do you screw up fried rice  it had a really odd flavor to it commatoken ive never not finished fried rice but left it alone periodtoken  the beef was actually decent and the california roll was good periodtoken  maybe would try some of their other sushi before i sign off of this place periodtoken  oh and one of the employees came out to eat their lunch right next to us which was a bowl of the soup but he ate it with chopsticks periodtoken  it was the loudest most disgusting sound ever periodtoken  think of scooping soup out of a bowl and slurping it into your mouth periodtoken  i thought it was a joke at first periodtoken  thats probably standard practice for them but wow periodtoken","9158":"been here a few times now periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenyelps two star rating describes it best meh periodtoken ive experienced better periodtoken and after our last late night venture here commatoken we probably will not be back periodtoken unless we are super hungry andor drunk as this place is 24 hours periodtoken   food comes out fast periodtoken like scary fast periodtoken so fast commatoken even our hungry 10 year old son who usually complains that the food is taking too long made a comment about how fast it was lol periodtoken food we have tried is mediocre at best periodtoken their hash is weird periodtoken its like commatoken par mashed potatoes that are grilled on a flat top to get the exterior crunchy periodtoken and the inside is mushy with lumps periodtoken pancakes and waffles are ok periodtoken pies and cakes are storebought commatoken not made in house periodtoken  service is good though periodtoken gotta give them that periodtoken we received friendly and fast service the times we were there periodtoken prices are cheap periodtoken portions are huge periodtoken you get what you pay for though periodtoken","9159":"i got a burger from here once and it had a green mold spot on it after eating the sandwich not the mold i called the manager and she told me this was impossible that this happened periodtoken pretty much saying i was a liar periodtoken never did go there again and its been 3 years periodtoken","9160":"went here for lunch periodtoken i expect this rating to improve once the shop has been open and is less crowded commatoken and they have a chance to really nail down their kitchen production process periodtoken summary at bottom if tldr  location not bad commatoken sansom is one of my favorite streets in philly periodtoken the new space is well decorated and pretty well set up periodtoken there is an entrance on one side that leads directly to the order station commatoken and there is a assembly line and large pick up area after periodtoken the waiting area is a bit tight commatoken but even with the large crowd i wasnt uncomfortable periodtoken i like that you can see the entire kitchen completely open periodtoken we sat against the wall commatoken and it was ample space to lay out our food periodtoken  service friendly enough and efficient periodtoken you can hear as they call your order number too periodtoken didnt see many order mistakes and the manager was on top of things periodtoken the wait in line took about 20 minutes unacceptable for lunch fare commatoken but not their fault persay and the food took about 10 a bit long when they had a massive pile of burgers cooked and ready periodtoken at this point i cant sink so much time over my lunch break so be aware of this point periodtoken   food i ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar medium and red onions and a side of truffle fries periodtoken   burger first the bun is good commatoken but not what i expected periodtoken it has the texture of stale bread commatoken but this ended up being great periodtoken the burger held in place wonderfully and it did not fall apart like the softer potato rolls for example periodtoken my burger was cooked great but was extremely salty on one side periodtoken the cheddar was rubbery and flavorless commatoken and the onions were very overcooked commatoken mushy and flavorless periodtoken the side of pickles was unexpected and a bonus i love pickles periodtoken good size in my opinion commatoken but my food mate thought it was too small for the price almost looked like a slider commatoken 5 periodtoken5oz uncooked patty periodtoken overall it was a good burger commatoken but not great periodtoken out of 5 i would give it 3 periodtoken if the cheese and onions were better commatoken it would gain 1 because the meat was tasty and juicy the heart if you will periodtoken   the truffle fries were a gigantic portion for 2 periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we should have shared a single order periodtoken they were awesome and the smell of truffles was fantastic periodtoken the flavor was not overpowering commatoken almost subtle addition to the fries periodtoken the fries were not at all greasy which i really commatoken really appreciate and the way they were cut was great periodtoken some were nice and crunchy and some were soft so there was alot to like here periodtoken fries get 5 out of 5 the spicy fries were on par with these periodtoken   milkshake god i wish i ordered one after seeing them make it   but i am sure my wallet 5 bucks and my stomach thank my brain for saving them periodtoken from the looks of it though commatoken it would have raised the rating 1 star alone haha periodtoken   value was the burger worth 5 periodtoken50 in my ideal world periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken no periodtoken but comparatively in the market it wasnt outrageous periodtoken total meal cost without drink was 9 after tax and i think that is slightly too much considering what you get commatoken but we could have also split the 2 fries for how many you get periodtoken i couldnt make this a regular place to eat as i dont see the value periodtoken   summary the wait times were prohibitive of a lunch time meal commatoken and the value is right on the border of being overpriced the jury is still out but i enjoyed the meal enough that i would go back periodtoken 2 stars is not mean to be a put down commatoken and i think it is accurate of the food and experience periodtoken i hope the lines get more manageable at lunch time though periodtoken   me and my friend made an overunder bet on if this place would last periodtoken goodburger didnt survive a year for the same issues i brought up with 500d value commatoken wait time periodtoken however commatoken i expect it to last so took the over side periodtoken i hope i dont lose","9163":"ive visited einsteins 5 times within the last month periodtoken the store itself is clean commatoken theres ample seating commatoken but there is a distinct sense of chaos that is unmistakeable the instant you walk in the door during a busy time of day which seems to be just my luck periodtoken periodtoken  orders are taken and you are sheparded down the line only to discover that what you ordered is out of stock only moments later periodtoken  this has happened on at least 3 occasions when ive ordered simply plain bagels and challuh rolls which i dont understand why these are even on the menu periodtoken periodtoken i think ive only gotten to get them once periodtoken periodtoken today i went through the drivethru which is an accident waiting to happen  there was lots of paint scrapings on the side walls of the building and ordered a plain bagel periodtoken periodtoken nothing more  just one plain bagel periodtoken i got it home and discovered id been given a poppyseed periodtoken periodtoken i can appreciate a good bagel commatoken and einstein does in fact have them commatoken its just the other incompetence that bothers me periodtoken  especially when its not isolated to just one or two instances periodtoken the workers seem cheerful enough periodtoken periodtoken just wish theyd actually listen to whats being ordered instead of worrying about rushing to the next one in line periodtoken","9164":"its a really lovely bar commatoken the food was good commatoken but in no way was that burger worth 18 periodtoken for 18 dollars it should be the most amazing burger in philly commatoken it should reach up and slap me in the face periodtoken i stick by the royal tavern burger commatoken hands down periodtoken","9165":"service was very commatokenvery slow considering it is an order at the counter place periodtoken i got the salted caramel donut which was good commatoken but not great periodtoken the donut was a little heavy periodtoken i also orderd the cinnamon roll which i did not care for periodtoken it came swimming in gooey icing and was soooo overly sweet that you almost couldn t taste the cinnamon periodtoken plus they had sprinkled sugar on top of the roll too  sometimes balance of flavors is more important than just throwing everything in periodtoken if they had free wifi i couldnt find it periodtoken","9166":"we have been coming to this location since they open but it is slowly going down hill periodtoken the people that work the register dont know the products periodtoken there is always a problem with their drink machines periodtoken even though i usually order the same item commatoken it never comes out the same periodtoken this sad because there was a lot of hope for this business periodtoken","9167":"they babysit you at the yogurt commatoken i hate that periodtoken i came with my husband and mother who is in her mid sixties periodtoken if you would think of people to cause a ruckus two fat people and a geriatric are not it periodtoken they continued babysitting after my mother got her cup periodtoken the flavors were either too over powering or too bland when compared to other yogurt places periodtoken  if the yogurt was better and i time traveled to high school maybe i would understand the babysitting periodtoken there are too many other yogurt places you can go to that dont do that periodtoken","9168":"went here on recommendation to try the gnudi and i may not be taking recommendations from that person again periodtoken they seemed to be pan seared commatoken smothered in butter and then served in a greasy oily mess periodtoken gross periodtoken  also commatoken trying to get my bartenders attention from him flirting with the female bartender  made my experience even worse periodtoken when he finally would come over he acted annoyed that i was breaking up his little moment periodtoken","9169":"it pains me to write this review periodtoken i love cfa but the service at this one on december 23 commatoken 2016 at 136pm was terrible periodtoken there was a line for drive thru which is typical and understood inside there was a line out the door with 1 person working the register for about a 10 minute period periodtoken not the cfa i have come to love periodtoken","9172":"ordered the pizza to go was ready when promised but seems like they forgot the tomato sauce or something not up to the standards of other bjs ive been too","9173":"the wait was really long for our party periodtoken  we made a reservation commatoken and still had to wait an additional 30 minutes periodtoken  by the time we were seated commatoken they were out of brisket for the night periodtoken  overall commatoken the bbq was mediocre commatoken and the service was about the same periodtoken","9180":"the food is not good periodtoken i was quite dissapointed periodtoken  giving 2 stars as the customer service was really good periodtoken","9185":"food was excellent commatoken no sarcasm steak and shrimp tacos were both on point periodtoken  however periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  do not sit upstairs service suffered immensely commatoken we literally had to walk downstairs to get our check after sitting and waiting 15 minutes to get our credit card back periodtoken when we walked downstairs commatoken our waiter and two other employees were literally sitting on the stairwell w our receipts in hand commatoken just not coming up to finish our experience periodtoken  oh commatoken and it must be noted that my wife found a sizable piece of saran wrap in her rice periodtoken when mentioned commatoken we were comped with a free dessert periodtoken a nice gesture commatoken but once again left us with no waiter for 15 minutes while we picked at it even though full periodtoken   great food commatoken slow service commatoken plastic wrap periodtoken the end periodtoken","9190":"as others have mentioned  insanely priced periodtoken but friendly commatoken almost never a line commatoken and in the neighborhood periodtoken also commatoken they have pretty decent hours periodtoken youll never really find a deal here commatoken but for oneoff shopping they do the trick periodtoken","9192":"so overall the food is okay commatoken but i have major issues with precooked burgers  fries at a burger restaurant periodtoken  for 10 each burger and around 5 for fries it should be cooked to order not made to order periodtoken i watched the kitchen cook   fill large bowls of fries and leave them under a heat light commatoken while expeditors used tongs and place them on plates and out if the kitchen periodtoken same for many of the burgersthey were precooked and warmed on the grill with their respective toppings periodtoken when my food arrived it was room temp at best periodtoken they have potential to be good burgers but please dont give me fast food at restaurant pricing periodtoken i was disappointed with baileys this go around periodtoken","9193":"its still quite difficult to find a restaurant that has gluten free bagels andor bread periodtoken however commatoken fillabagel does  i was so excited about it commatoken i didnt even mind shelling out 3 periodtoken00 just for the frozen commatoken then microwaved semi faux bagel periodtoken the very sweet girl who took our order commatoken cecilia commatoken was great periodtoken we ordered 1 bagel with a schmear of smoked salmon salad and one

commatoken the gluten free commatoken microwaved only and 2 partially filled 2 oz containers commatoken one with cream cheese commatoken one with salmon schmear periodtoken i immediately told the nice woman who handed it to me that we were told we were to get 2 containers of each commatoken that the girl who took our order specifically asked the person who prepares the sandwiches commatoken then this other woman had to check with someone commatoken who had to check with someone else periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokena very grumpy someone else then they all had to discuss it commatoken all the while commatoken my microwaved commatoken untoasted 3 periodtoken00 bagel was turning into a tiny rubber like disc thats what happens if you nuke a gf bagel and dont eat it immediately if someone internally told another employee wrong info commatoken deal with it behind the scenes commatoken and dont make the customer wait for you all to figure out where your miscommunication happened finally commatoken the very grumpy woman kelly commatoken leaves 2 more 2 oz containers even less filled with schmear at the pick up counter and says nothing no sorry for the wait commatoken no here you go commatoken not even heres your st commatoken  just a pissed off face and lousy attitude if you hate your job that much and despise dealing with the public commatoken who was just looking to get what they were told they were getting commatoken dont work there leave your bad attitude at the door it may only be about a bagel place commatoken but it seems anymore noone cares if they do their job well if i had that type of attitude commatoken i would be fired if you are in a customer service type job commatoken service your customers happily make them feel comfortable and welcome and want to come back commatoken especially in a little neighborhood business i have business right in that area relatively often lately and would have made it a go to place commatoken but now commatoken not so sure periodtoken to go grab a bagel and coffee should be a really relaxed thing commatoken this was far from it periodtoken ","9195":"i am probably one of the biggest fans of sonic out there commatoken but sadly commatoken i have to give this one very poor reviews periodtoken i normally order a ton of items here commatoken but at this place i ordered just one item and they couldnt seem to process my order  so it took five minutes to order one item periodtoken im not even kidding periodtoken and then inexplicably it took quite a while to get my item commatoken and then the item with a different size that i had requested periodtoken im sure some people have good experiences here but this is a synopsis of my quick commatoken less than pleasant stop

im going to have to ring you up in the front because this register decided to be a tard periodtoken    then commatoken as i was shopping for odds and ends commatoken i noticed a man following me around the store periodtoken while comparing prices on deodorant commatoken i saw him at the end of the aisle commatoken crouching down in a squat commatoken and staring at me periodtoken after making

meantime commatoken we got an appetizer of salsa commatoken queso and guac periodtoken the chips were really light and crispy and the guac and salsa were fresh commatoken but the queso was straight up out of a jar and microwaved periodtoken  i ordered shrimp enchiladas commatoken and they were kind of foul periodtoken the shrimp looked barely cooked and had a rubbery texture periodtoken the sauce tasted like it was right from the can and the dominant flavor was salt periodtoken the rice was somehow undercooked so that there were little hard pebbly bits throughout periodtoken the side of black

minutes to get a check and process payment once we were done periodtoken    there you have it  an hour out of my life for an average commatoken overpriced burger periodtoken  server was nice and i tipped her well commatoken but overall execution was very poor periodtoken  i didnt spot a manager on the floor or i would have provided the same feedback periodtoken   and that we make our own soda thing is dumb periodtoken  go ahead and make your own but have other commercial options available periodtoken","9237":"tastes like mcdonalds commatoken but this place is soooo slow periodtoken i often have to repeat myself when placing and order as well periodtoken","9238":"was hungry for sushi last night and wanted to order online periodtoken  the online menu is as busy and as confusing as the menus they have in the restaurant periodtoken its doesnt even look attractive periodtoken  needs to be done over periodtoken i gave up and went to kroger periodtoken  its much easier periodtoken","9241":"i dont understand how this place has so many stars periodtoken i just had the most disgusting meal of my entire life periodtoken i ordered the beef gyro platter  a strawberry banana smoothie for delivery periodtoken  the platter had hummus  a greek salad with it periodtoken  the gyro wasnt even on the pita commatoken the pita came on the side periodtoken  i could barely chew the pita and it was as tough as cardboard if not tougher periodtoken  the hummus was half water and the salad was horrendous periodtoken  the dressing had my eyes squinting and the lettuce tasted very old periodtoken  the rice was good but thats about it periodtoken","9243":"mediocre food periodtoken service at hostess station needs lots of improvement periodtoken layout of restaurant is terrible periodtoken not impressed by servers periodtoken training needed in food service","9244":"good smoothie commatoken but the service is real rough periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we waited 20 minutes for three smoothies  in the end they made the wrong ones periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken other folks waiting were also very frustrated","9246":"beef is very average commatoken pork is better but still not great periodtoken  is high given the food  atmosphere periodtoken not for me","9247":"nothing special really periodtoken   this place is around the corner from my apartment and ive wanted to try it for a while periodtoken i ordered 10 medium wings periodtoken i chose to pickup commatoken so i sat inside and waited periodtoken it was a reasonable wait periodtoken   about 10 minutes go by and they announce that 10 mild wings are ready periodtoken i continue to wait periodtoken they give the order to another customer and then she turns to me and says i think this is your order because i should have more wings than this periodtoken she returns the wings to them periodtoken there was then some bickering behind the counter and then someone turns to me and says this is your order periodtoken i stated 10 medium wings and they assured me oooo yes 10 medium wings periodtoken  they were no where near medium periodtoken there was barely any sauce on them at all commatoken it was all in the bottom of the container periodtoken   i doubt ill go back","9248":"so let me preface my review by saying commatoken this isnt set in stone and it could go up after i sample other items periodtoken also commatoken i realize with its opening commatoken it has a lot of community support and i love seeing local family businesses thrive periodtoken therefore commatoken i must be honest in hopes that they can get even better  i had a peach cobbler cupcake periodtoken the whipped cream was very good commatoken the cake light commatoken not too sweet in light of the sweetness of the fruit good call but the base was not executed well considering the delivery periodtoken periodtoken periodtokena cupcake periodtoken it was very gooey commatoken maybe caramelized commatoken but just hard to eat out of the paper periodtoken and i guess the thing that was most disappointing was its 3 price tag periodtoken maybe im not a big cupcake buyer commatoken but that just seemed high for such a tiny dessert periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken the coffee lacks in flavor as well periodtoken it was very weak and lacking any richness periodtoken  again commatoken im all about second chances and hope to try another menu item again soon","9249":"this tims drive thru has a reputation of cutting you off and rushing you through to the point thats its rude periodtoken its happened multiple times to neighbors commatoken friends and my husband and myself periodtoken there are few times i would have ordered more but was cut mid order periodtoken  and today was the first time in three months it was not rushed so i have a two star now instead of one star periodtoken","9250":"i have always enjoyed raising canes and the customer service i received so you can image my excitement when i found out one was opening in noco st periodtoken louis periodtoken  unfortunately the customer service ive received from the lindbergh location has been less than desirable periodtoken  i ordered food today and found that there was a missing item when i reached home periodtoken i quickly returned with my food and receipt and was met with an immediate attitude periodtoken there was no apology just an annoyed stare after providing me with my food periodtoken there will soon be a chic fil la in our area commatoken guess that will be my new fav if this is what i can expect from raising canes","9251":"this place was quite large commatoken but it wasnt that great periodtoken for the location commatoken it may been decent and an easy place to shop for the odds and ends of an oriental cuisine that average american shops dont have commatoken but they are priced higher than most other city asian shops on most of their products periodtoken selection of fish commatoken meat and obviously perishable inventory seemed large periodtoken things that arent as obviously perishable seemed that they may have been sitting on the shelf longer than perhaps fdaallowed periodtoken overall commatoken it was just an experience periodtoken","9252":"we ate there last night periodtoken the food was great but our waiter was terrible and rude periodtoken id love to give this restaurant a higher score but the service from the waiter specifically was so bad it left us shaking our heads periodtoken it really doesnt matter how good the food at a restaurant is if the wait staff makes you never want to return periodtoken","9253":"this place takes forever to serve mediocre japanese fare and pretty terrible sushi and bombards you with japanese techno music at an unusually loud level for a restaurant periodtoken its pretty damn expensive and the service is awful definitely not worth the huge amount of time and relatively large sum of money you will drop periodtoken id go with samurai or tenno instead periodtoken","9254":"this concerns breakfast only periodtoken the much bragged about popovers are a joke periodtoken theyre exactly what i would make at home with the williamssonoma recipe periodtoken at home they wont cost a ridiculous amount of money or time and i wouldnt have to deal with all the pretentious nonsense multiple flavors of butter polluting the air of this place periodtoken   the butter out of my fridge would taste fresh too periodtoken   coffee was ok periodtoken but not worth the wait or the cost or the annoying atmosphere with the gigantic tvs blaring away some news talk show periodtoken   ill rewrite this review if i ever get in on a different context periodtoken but downtown badly needs a really good commatoken quick breakfast option commatoken and this sure aint it periodtoken","9258":"id love to feel better about coming for a meal someday because we hear good things about the food commatoken but i cant get out of my head my first experience going in there periodtoken a year or 2 ago  i simply came in to locate a menu to either look at or to take home periodtoken  i looked around to locate the menu and saw 56 pretty female employees standing over to my left periodtoken  they were not far from me periodtoken  they continued to talk during this time periodtoken  not one of them looked up at me commatoken and no one from there or anywhere came forward to welcome me commatoken or ask what they could do for me or if i would be eating periodtoken  i felt uncomfortable periodtoken  it was not crowded periodtoken  is this an overly picky criticism   i really dont think so periodtoken  to me it spoke in volumes a non customer service attitude periodtoken thank you for reading this comment periodtoken","9260":"i always drove out of my way to eat at this location periodtoken last 2 times the quality of the food is poor commatoken the trash cans were running over commatoken and the employees were chatting at a table  seemed bothered when customers arrived periodtoken were done with this qdoba periodtoken","9268":"definitely a locals place periodtoken its not in the safest feeling area entrance out back with limited lighting periodtoken would recommend a serious update to the place periodtoken we bowled periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken so that was still accomplished periodtoken","9269":"i wanted to like this place but it wasnt anything special and kind of greasy periodtoken glad i got there at a time where we were able to walk right in and get a table without a wait periodtoken i would have been upset if i had waited in a long line periodtoken i didnt have pancakes though because they dont have a gluten free option periodtoken","9270":"not much to be impressed with here periodtoken  my burger was overcooked and lacked flavor periodtoken not sue what all the hype is about","9273":"we used to go here weekly periodtoken last time i ordered takeout commatoken there was a loooong hair in my roll periodtoken it grossed me and i havent been back since periodtoken","9274":"came here as part of a tour periodtoken we were suppose to go next door to hermitage house smorgasbord however commatoken the food looked unappetizing so we walked next door to jiab periodtoken my friend texted the number on the door to get a free curly fries periodtoken we ordered junior bacon cheeseburger and a 10 piece chicken nuggets which came out to 4 hard to believe being that im from nyc periodtoken we were one of few people in the restaurant at the time and the woman behind the counter was friendly commatoken even giving us two free drinks periodtoken it is a fast food place so food was average for me periodtoken however i do like mcdonalds and wendys chicken nuggets better but i guess i am bias periodtoken glad this place was next door to save us from the food at herimtage house which commatoken according to people who went there for the tour commatoken said was gross periodtoken","9278":"writen june 2011 oh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the food truck a staple in some cities a midnight dream walking from the taverns commatoken pubs commatoken and cocktail bars alike everyone loves the smells and enticements of a great food truck periodtoken i have heard rumors that west coast taco was one of these great food trucks best tacos in town they would say periodtoken i find the best way to test the theory of the quality of the food truck is to do so sober periodtoken the drunken palate cannot be trusted periodtoken so commatoken i found myself walking across from the indianapolis capitol building and there it was a tall black truck with a group of people waiting around it periodtoken i thought to myself this is a good sign a line is always good periodtoken there where people suited up commatoken people in shorts and jeans a nice group periodtoken i look to the menu and ask the young lady for the burrito with pork and a taco of course periodtoken i waited for my reasonably priced meal that was handed to me in a reasonable time periodtoken i walked a bit found a nice shady bench and took a bite periodtoken expectations set high and was let down periodtoken this wasnt the greatest taco not even close the burrito included periodtoken the rice seemed over cooked and nothing special the meat was fine but again nothing to write home about but enough to warn you about periodtoken  if you are drunk commatoken bombed commatoken smashed commatoken or even a bit tipsy these maybe the tacos for you but they are not for me periodtoken food trucks these days are seen as restaurants on wheels gourmet pirates that travel the asphalts of our cities serving its citizens delicious goodness of whatever niche they are driving at periodtoken there are a number of food trucks in indianapolis now i have been to three of them and tasted what they have told me was their signature grub and have been disappointed periodtoken food trucks are coming to indianapolis and i have high expectations commatoken every time you hear of these food trucks they are suppose to be the best ever and i am waiting for the best to come to indy because they are not here yet periodtoken","9279":"ive passed this place a few times and wanted to give it a try with my girlfriend periodtoken we went in for the first time last night commatoken and it was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeneh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengood periodtoken heres my big 5 breakdown  customer service  the entire staff or at least everyone i noticed or encountered didnt seem to be a day over 20 years old commatoken which unfortunately correlated to inexperience commatoken and slightly poor professionalism periodtoken the hostess was confused and gave the classic line commatoken im new here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken commatoken the waiter commatoken kind commatoken and helpful disappeared after our meal was delivered and im convinced she forgot us altogether until briefly passing by with our bewildered look with my payment in hand periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken we had been waiting commatoken a while periodtoken closing note we counted 4 different people approached our table within the hour offering to take perceived finished plates commatoken or refills in which i had to repeat commatoken no thank you commatoken im still working on that periodtoken my thought leave us alone so we can enjoy the meal   food quality  it was good periodtoken not great commatoken or offering anything out of the ordinary periodtoken its a burger bar that i applaud for the fun beer paring and housemade carbonated sodas periodtoken aside from the beverage uniqueness commatoken its not pulling ahead from the competition periodtoken ill get to the better competition in my price criteria periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenkeep reading  atmosphere this gets my most positive critique the place is colorfully vibrant with lovely murals and pictures on the walls periodtoken theres a retro miniature train set chugging around the restaurant on tracks suspended above which allows for a fun familyoriented experience as well periodtoken matched with the fun housemade sodas including green apple and dark cherry commatoken with the local craft beer for the adults commatoken its a wellrounded familyinclusive atmosphere periodtoken  cleanliness not much to say here periodtoken its clean and well maintained periodtoken and that includes the bathrooms periodtoken well done periodtoken   price this is their downfall in my opinion periodtoken its a little pricey for what were speaking in reference to burgers periodtoken last night commatoken 30 periodtoken00 for two burgers commatoken two sodas commatoken and two small sides periodtoken that includes the tip periodtoken pricing points are not competitive for the quality you can receive elsewhere periodtoken and by elsewhere im referring to boogie burger in bripp commatoken or bru burger downtown periodtoken both easily comparable or better periodtoken   overall commatoken im glad we can say we tried it periodtoken probably a onestop experience in my book periodtoken","9280":"i said three times no egg on my breakfast sandwich periodtoken did they listen nope   this place is good if you need something with wifi and for other meals commatoken but im giving two stars since i didnt feel like i was taken seriously this morning periodtoken i will be going elsewhere next time i need a quick grabandgo breakfast","9285":"precinct pizza is a standard subpar pizza joint serving up new york style pies periodtoken the inside is decorated with a large amount of new york memorabilia periodtoken it can get fairly cramped when crowded commatoken but there were a lot of families with kids enjoying themselves periodtoken most of the food options are not for the health conscious periodtoken they have a wide variety of specialty pizzas with 3 or 4 different types available as slices on any given day periodtoken the cheese was better than fast food chain pizza commatoken but thats about all i can say periodtoken the bbq chicken pizza was average as well with a subpar bbq sauce periodtoken i also had some of a chicken roll with bacon and tomato periodtoken the dough was cooked well but the inside was salty salty salty with small bits of chicken and crumbled up bacon periodtoken the marinara sauce was also salty commatoken but went well with the roll periodtoken  overall commatoken better than dominos if you want pizza and good for the whole family commatoken but if you want better pizza commatoken you can find it elsewhere periodtoken","9289":"dont waste your precious time or money periodtoken the service wasnt completely terrible commatoken but definitely could have been better periodtoken we saw our waitress 3 times and had to flag her down for all periodtoken my friend and i both ordered lemonade periodtoken whoever made the lemonade definitely forgot the sugar periodtoken we did get refills and they tasted a lot better periodtoken fried pickles were disgusting and soggy periodtoken i didnt know it was possible to make a bad fried pickle periodtoken macaroni and cheese had no flavor periodtoken i ordered the popper burger which also had no flavor and over cooked periodtoken dont believe the hype periodtoken they also have a really long table that that make you sit at with other people commatoken with no personal space at all periodtoken we could barely here ourselves talking periodtoken my friend and i asked to be seated at single table on the upper level which wasnt a problem periodtoken but seriously dont waste your money commatoken you will thank me later","9296":"i came here once with a friend with the intention of using a dealyo voucher i purchased periodtoken was disappointed when i was told i couldnt redeem because i hadnt it printed out periodtoken i was visiting from nyc periodtoken so embarrassing periodtoken ok periodtoken so a few months later came back with printed voucher in hand periodtoken i have to say this place probably needs to close down and regroup for so many reasons periodtoken the decor needs up dating to start periodtoken for what your paying for the food it needs to be more visually appealing in this place periodtoken looks plain old periodtoken  and plastic cups come on periodtoken now to the food commatoken the real reason im here periodtoken nothing special commatoken rather below average periodtoken i had a seafood combo thingy periodtoken nothing tasted fresh periodtoken it was like it was left over from the day before periodtoken so disappointed periodtoken was so embarrassed i brought someone with me periodtoken this place needs to get it together periodtoken","9297":"i never thought you could screw up a dunkin donuts periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand then i went to this location periodtoken always out of everything commatoken latte machine is always broken and service is slow periodtoken","9298":"the cookies are wonderful periodtoken the service is so terribleits laughable this location is still open periodtoken on my in house to go order commatoken i asked for a lentil bowl with egg asked about it 3x and 6 reg periodtoken sizes cookies and 2 of each chipper cookies periodtoken i was charged for but not given any of the chipper cookies periodtoken no one greeted me commatoken i was in there and no one cared to pay attention to my order nor be looking to even see me standing at either periodtoken counter periodtoken i left 4 cookies short with my lentil bowl leaking out of the bag because no one cares to actually put the lid on a soup periodtoken came home with soup in my car commatoken missing cookies and feeling taken advantage of periodtoken knit wit teens working there couldnt care less periodtoken please train and test your employees periodtoken i would have had better service from toddlersit is offensively bad staff commatoken product commatoken service here periodtoken","9299":"ive been curious to try mad mex since it opened in its wynnewood location a few weeks ago since id heard mixed reviews about their other locations periodtoken i went for a friends birthday celebration and i wish i could say i had a better experience commatoken but things just went from bad to worse periodtoken  we put our name in when we arrived and were waiting at the bar for our table for quite a while maybe 30 minutes when someone went to check to see how much longer it would be and they had crossed our name off the wait list commatoken which made absolutely no sense periodtoken they said it would be about ten more minutes until a table opened for the 8 of us periodtoken meanwhile commatoken two people in our party ordered their food at the bar since they were in a bit of a rush periodtoken  soon after commatoken we were seated periodtoken after ordering commatoken it took a while to get our food commatoken but when we did commatoken i didnt notice the waitress coming around the table and was looking in the other direction when suddenly commatoken i leaned forward a bit and bang the waitress had knocked a couple of the big heavy plates she was serving right into my tooth and my wrist periodtoken she must have been placing them down with a lot of force commatoken because she came pretty hard against my tooth and wrist commatoken enough to leave my wrist really red and bruised and my tooth sore periodtoken so granted this was an accident and the waitress was very apologetic about the incident commatoken part of me definitely expected her to at least offer me a free meal commatoken which in my opinion would have been the professional way of handling the situation periodtoken not only did that not happen commatoken but when she handed us one big check and we politely asked her if she could split it into individual checks commatoken she insisted that she was very busy and we just write down what we all had on the bill periodtoken after this was taking way too long commatoken we decided to just ask again commatoken and she did it commatoken but was obviously not happy about it periodtoken  and on top of all that commatoken the food i thought was just mediocre periodtoken i had chicken fajitas commatoken which came with a lot of toppings commatoken but the seasoning on the chicken was lacking flavor and had too intense of a lime flavor commatoken which in my mind commatoken the seasoning makes or breaks chicken fajitas periodtoken i also didnt care for the guacamole that came on the side periodtoken it was also very limey commatoken without much other flavor periodtoken the flour tortillas were good though periodtoken  id say one other positive in this experience was the ambiance of the restaurant periodtoken it seems like this place is one of those restaurants youd go more for the ambiance and margaritas rather than the food periodtoken  one last thing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe two others in our party who ended up sitting at the bar to eat their meals said that it took 30 minutes just for them to get their check commatoken so they couldnt even join us after theyd finished periodtoken","9300":"despite never purchasing anything from say cheese myself commatoken i had half of my friends grilled cheese and was pleased commatoken but not blown away periodtoken yet commatoken what really turned me off from this truck was being interrogated by one of the owners on why i actively visit other neighboring trucks street food commatoken farm truck as opposed to buying from them periodtoken i said i was lactose intolerant which i am commatoken mildly and he rolled his eyes commatoken mockingly replying with commatoken yeaaah commatoken okay periodtoken im not sure if this was meant to be a pick up line or what commatoken but it certainly deterred me from ever coming back periodtoken","9301":"im going to give castrillos two stars because it was underwhelming to me periodtoken  but it was not bad periodtoken  i stopped in for a slice because its really the only place that ive seen that offers slices periodtoken  having moved here from nyc about 8 months ago my eyes lit up at the prospect of getting a slice  well commatoken it was a bit disappointing to find out that they only serve slices between the hours of 11am1pm periodtoken    weird periodtoken so finally commatoken i remember the time properly and was able to stop in for a slice periodtoken  at first glance  eww periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe slice of cheese pizza looks like a big pillow periodtoken strike 1 periodtoken  slices should be on thin crust and not oooozing with cheese periodtoken  thats just not necessary periodtoken  then i take a bite and i am pleasantly surprised that the sauce is actually pretty good periodtoken  so commatoken im thinking i would entertain the idea of possibly ordering a pie for delivery one day and make sure that i ask for thin crust commatoken light on the cheese periodtoken   i really just dont understand why people think its necessary to pile on the cheese periodtoken  that is just not what makes a good pizza slice periodtoken  its all about having the perfect balance between sauce and cheese and perfectly baked commatoken of course periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwe shall see how round 2 goes periodtoken  whenever that may be periodtoken","9302":"this is my everyday dunkin but the past 3 weeks ive been getting burnt iced coffee if i wasnt on my way to work id go back and complain one more time and ill try a different dunkin","9303":"i went in to order a takeout dinner but the host  owner not sure was too busy on the phone speaking with her cell phone provider took her 510 minutes before she decided to try and multitask by taking my order    the food was ok but the service is awful ","9306":"fun to look for bargains periodtoken prices have escalated since i began shopping here occasionally periodtoken i think their prices are now equivalent to any other grocery store except acme commatoken giant commatoken etc doesnt sell outdated merchandise commatoken food periodtoken they sell fresh food periodtoken","9307":"this place has really gone down hill over the past year periodtoken they are randomly closed during normal business hours commatoken so its a hit or miss if you can actually go in and get yogurt periodtoken my son  i were in a hurry today and got county vanilla and milk chocolate commatoken we should have taken the sweet lady working up on a sample bc it would have saved me money periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey were both disgusting so bad i throw them both away after a couple of bits periodtoken disappointing because it used to be such a cute place","9309":"this review is for the bar only periodtoken bar tenders were not friendly at all periodtoken drinks were ok periodtoken my main issue was how dirty the bar area was periodtoken it is also a tight space periodtoken","9311":"we got a growler here and the lady charged us the full price but only filled it halfway periodtoken will not come back as they short pour the glasses as well periodtoken","9312":"tjs needs to enforce the service animal rules or post a sign that reflects their practice of allowing animals in their market periodtoken  i am a dog person periodtoken  but i dont allow my pets to eat off the dinner table periodtoken  this store has open produce and meat periodtoken  if they want to be a pets mart and allow animals commatoken please sign your store with a warning for those of us who have no idea about the hygiene of these pets periodtoken","9314":"this place made me sad because i think their beer choices are excellent but boy were they having a bad night when i took the time to try their food periodtoken their tenderloin was completely flavorless periodtoken the salmon tacos were a sad piece of overcooked dry salmon on top of a tortilla with virtually nothing to bring it flavor or moisture periodtoken the burger that was ordered medium well was delivered closer to a hockey puck periodtoken  our server never took our dishes away until she put down the bill despite us stacking them and putting them at the edge of our table periodtoken  when i did pay the 32 bill in cash with a 50 sticking out she asked if i needed change periodtoken  major pet peeve periodtoken  my tip is stick to the beer at the bar periodtoken","9319":"overrated for a bbq place commatoken the portion sizes are crazy small periodtoken i got the messy pig commatoken which is essential coleslaw with a half an ounce of pulled pork periodtoken   there are better places in tampa periodtoken","9322":"i went in there about 2 weeks ago for sandwich and a drink i use to always get periodtoken  i went through the dt which i always do because i have no time for lines inside periodtoken lady on speaker super nice and upbeat periodtoken never said anything about being out of a ingredient that for me makes the drink and maybe silly to others periodtoken but if i am going to spend 8 bucks its not petty for me periodtoken i waited 6 or 7 minutes just to make it to the window which was more than fine i know what i am getting myself into when i go here periodtoken got to the window and she took my payment than told me my drink could not be made with strawberries and said but that is okay does not matter periodtoken i looked at her and said to me it does because it makes my drink and i use the strawberries in water after i finish my refresher periodtoken she said well we do not have it so you can just drink it without periodtoken i asked for a refund and she did so periodtoken but she was not willing to come up with another option periodtoken she was just rude and snappy because she assumed someone paying almost an hours of work for coffee would be fine with missing what is her favorite part of the drink is periodtoken not sure what her name is and honestly does not matter she wants to be sour she has to live with her self periodtoken just make sure you ask if they have what is needed for the refreshers if you are like me and its the best part of your drink","9323":"dont believe the hype periodtoken  ok periodtoken i have tried these donuts four times periodtoken these simply are not good donuts periodtoken the people who own and work at strange donuts are nice commatoken creative commatoken and hardworking folk commatoken but their donuts do not taste good periodtoken im judging this based on all of their sweet donuts periodtoken the gooey butter donut had a very gritty topping periodtoken the cake style donuts are too dense and dry periodtoken the fritter was the best commatoken but i wouldnt eat it again periodtoken i wont be returning because the donuts are not delicious periodtoken","9324":"they use to be great there periodtoken  and the staff was too periodtoken  now they jokers and the manager there doesnt seem to be there now periodtoken   my fiance and me use to eat there all the time but now we avoid it periodtoken","9327":"this could be a 1 star review but the food was in fact good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  starting with the positives of the food periodtoken the many options of beef commatoken bison commatoken elk commatoken and boar and some vegan options were fun to look through and left our table of 3 with one black bean commatoken one elk commatoken and one boar burger periodtoken we split up the 2 meat burgers to share between the carnivores periodtoken  the food was excellent periodtoken the large order of fries for the table and not as individual sides were plenty for us to share and the sauces were very tasty periodtoken the side of spicy pickles however were disappointingly not spicy periodtoken there was a hint of horseradish but that was it periodtoken  the portions of the burgers themselves were quite small and left me feeling kind of hungry after including the fires periodtoken also commatoken the black bean burger did not impress the vegan in our group periodtoken he decided to have the burger in a collard leaf to be glutenfree but i feel like this just eliminates the whole idea of it being a burger periodtoken  service was also underwhelming as the staff wasnt particularly attentive say with the water and making sure the orders were fulfilled  we had to ask about a side that didnt come at first periodtoken also commatoken our party of 3 was seated at one of the booths which didnt seem to be designed for more than 2 one on each side periodtoken i ended up feeling a little like i was sitting on the edge periodtoken  discounts for jeff id holders was nice but everything seemed overpriced which we attributed to the whole organic only thing periodtoken but even counting that we felt the burger portions were too small and the overall total was too high for still feeling hungry afterwards periodtoken  sadly i will not likely go again periodtoken  note we went for lunch on a weekend periodtoken","9328":"been three times now and while the decor commatoken sodas and service are great the food underwhelms and disappoints periodtoken its restaurant 101 that appetizers not be served alongside entrees and still br does periodtoken good fries and dips periodtoken everything else pales with poor execution im afraid periodtoken","9329":"i loved everything i had heard about h  w before visiting this location  lower prices commatoken fresh produce commatoken and a local business periodtoken  unfortunately i was unimpressed and disappointed with my visit periodtoken  the store was small commatoken and felt run down and dirty periodtoken  there were pieces of squished fruits and vegetables all over the floor commatoken and herds of kids and adults bumping into me and my cart as i tried to shop periodtoken    the prices are somewhat lower than a normal grocery store commatoken but i found nothing exceptional in terms of freshness periodtoken  the avocados and tomatoes were so underripe i had to go to safeway after to finish my shopping commatoken and items that i had been hoping would be of better qualityfreshness than a grocery store i periodtokene periodtoken green beans commatoken red peppers were just as sad and uninspiring as anything at sobeys or safeway periodtoken    when ringing up my purchases commatoken the cashier keyed in at least three of my items incorrectly commatoken perhaps more while i was getting my wallet and bags out periodtoken  given that h  w is an extra 10 minute drive from home commatoken the produce wasnt anything special and that i couldnt wait to escape the crowded cramped aisles commatoken i wont be back  the experience wasnt worth the few dollars savings periodtoken","9330":"i was really excited about going to cyranos and ended up very disappointed periodtoken  my friends and i were seated in front of a door with wait staff constantly walking by us but not acknowledging us periodtoken  we were seated for 30 minutes before i was able to flag down someone to ask whom our waiter would be periodtoken  the service throughout the evening was lackluster at best periodtoken  the food was good commatoken but it came from sugarfire so i cant even give cyranos kuddos for that periodtoken  for dessert i ordered the bread pudding it took 22 minutes from the time that we ordered dessert for it to hit the table and it was cold upon arrival periodtoken  needless to say i will not be back periodtoken","9331":"coffee is good but scone has too much sugar commatoken preservative or something that makes the flour too much like a pastry periodtoken starbucks please do not call it a scone this one even has frosting periodtoken blech","9337":"italian disneyland periodtoken as the only big italian market in town commatoken mazzaros has this action cornered commatoken and unfortunately commatoken they act like it periodtoken big crowds commatoken big prices commatoken long wait times and sluggish service periodtoken being from new york where they abound commatoken i have high standards for these specialty  markets periodtoken quality wise commatoken mazzaros is mediocre at best periodtoken definitely not worth the herald square sized crowds and madison avenue prices periodtoken lack of competition is the only thing which accounts for their beatlemania like popularity periodtoken on the plus side commatoken their bakery is quite respectable commatoken as well as their cheese shop periodtoken as to the butcher commatoken deli commatoken wines and grocery commatoken far better choices abound in saint petersburg periodtoken as a new yorker commatoken i pine for the days of balduccis on 6th ave commatoken or the quaint cheese shops of the east village periodtoken while mazzaros smacks of something sentimental of these commatoken i always find myself entering their amusement park as homesick commatoken and leaving sicker still commatoken only with buyers remorse periodtoken 40 for a frozen lasagna if youre lucky commatoken it wont fully thaw on the seat beside you while youre waiting to turn onto 22nd street periodtoken its truly the magic kingdom of italian markets periodtoken abracadabra your money just disappeared periodtoken","9340":"when we first noticed that the building that is now the village pub was being constructed into a new business commatoken my boyfriend and i were stoked periodtoken when we found out that it was going to be a pub  beer garden commatoken we actually let out cheer our home happens to be less than a block away so the thought of crawling home from evenings filled with mischief and relaxation sounded swell periodtoken   instead commatoken we avoid visiting this establishment due to crummy customer service commatoken strange policies commatoken and a lackluster menu periodtoken  ouch periodtoken  another reviewer mentioned that her 6 month old sleeping child was banned at 4pm due to a policy of not allowing anyone under 21 years old in the establishment i can understand wanting to take precautions from underage drinking but do people under 21 not eat as well you are really limiting your customer base if a family cant bring their supervised children for a meal periodtoken we attempted to sit on the patio with our 5 pound wellbehaved  silent chihuahua for some drinks one afternoon periodtoken the waitress rudely told us that no animals are allowed on the outside patio area and that we needed to take him home periodtoken i can understand that every place has their own policies but again commatoken nashville is a very petfriendly city especially east nashville and to exclude people with wellbehaved pets from enjoying cocktails on your patio will turn off another demographic of people from supporting your business periodtoken it should also be noted that she was rude in the delivery of her message and the service to follow wasnt up to par either periodtoken  the menu was another issue as it was limited to basically meats commatoken cheeses commatoken breads and pretzels periodtoken there werent any healthy or vegetarian options available either periodtoken i have heard from others that the pretzels and cheeses are good periodtoken i personally think that there should be more meal appropriate options instead of just snacks available periodtoken it could mean that consumers would be more likely to stick around if they didnt have to plan to leave for dinner somewhere else periodtoken  i can appreciate the fantastic job that was done in building out the village pub because it is quite comfy and cozy with a large wrap around porch periodtoken periodtoken the 24 ounce mugs of beer are also enjoyable because of the nice selection of microbrews and imports periodtoken   however commatoken the alienation of various groups of people who could be loyal customers and the lack of service make jumping in the car and heading to another locale more likely periodtoken tis a shame periodtoken","9341":"im really not a fan of the way the business is run periodtoken  the hours are not posted and are completely unpredictable the last 4 out of 5 times ive gone midafternoon on a spring weekend commatoken theyve been closed commatoken and the staff members are quite variable in terms of quality of making the softserve and smoothies as well as in level of courtesy periodtoken  while the softserve is pretty good with extra points for the large variety of flavors commatoken its about 2530 more expensive than the other frozen yogurt places in the area commatoken making it difficult to justify choosing it over other more consistent options periodtoken","9345":"bah whats up with this commatoken philly this was some inferior coffee maybe it was an off day commatoken but just because you have hipsters serving you coffee in gorgeous italian ceramic mugs commatoken doesnt mean its good periodtoken  im sorry man commatoken but the espresso in my cappucino tasted so burnt periodtoken it was not a very pleasant drink periodtoken my so didnt even finish his espresso commatoken he disliked it so much periodtoken  bahhh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokengreat place for the scene commatoken but dont go expecting amazing brew periodtoken","9346":"absolutely not authentic food terrible tortillas that they dont even double up when they serve them as a taco periodtoken when i had went on the facebook page to comment on a picture commatoken well they werent to happy that i was telling them that they over price their wrinky dink tacos periodtoken i lived in the southside of chicago in pilsen before i moved here and anyone whos been there just drools thinking about tia luis or el milagro periodtoken i was then told i could go to taco bell if i wanted a cheaper taco periodtoken and then blocked me from ever commenting on anything of theirs on facebook periodtoken   you cannot quite my reviews  anyways commatoken for a place trying to run a business its crazy that they are assuring us that they have mexicans cooking commatoken or being completely rude about suggestions periodtoken   nothing will ever be as good as my pilsen southside mexican food from chicago periodtoken at least they arent being bulldozed for a trader joes periodtoken ","9347":"the service is extremely slow periodtoken the bartender had no interest in serving a drink to me or a young lady also waiting at the bar periodtoken instead she played with her computer for a few minutes while joking with the three regulars at the end of the bar periodtoken afterward she served them each a refill and then prepared a drink and took it out on the casino floor periodtoken i gave up then periodtoken she did all of this while never even looking down in our direction commatoken even as she walked right by to take the drinks to the floor periodtoken","9348":"slowest starbucks drive thru in history periodtoken i could have driven back home commatoken brewed a pot of coffee commatoken and packed a travel mug in the time it takes to get through their drive thru periodtoken parking your car and heading inside is not any better either periodtoken its unfortunate commatoken but its the only starbucks with a drive thru in the riverview area periodtoken","9350":"i have shopped at the tampa road store since the mideighties periodtoken when the store grew and expanded commatoken i felt like it was due to the great service commatoken selection commatoken and quality that i  had always found consistently periodtoken   unfortunately commatoken i wonder if the groupon and half off depot has led to their demise periodtoken prices have gone up and stock is barely visible periodtoken my last visit i only left with chicken that i was overcharged for periodtoken","9351":"the ambiance is absolutely lovely commatoken especially sitting outside periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the service is so exceptionally slow commatoken that it ruins the entire experience periodtoken we have been here 4 times commatoken on various daystimes commatoken and never have we gotten our food faster than 1 periodtoken5 hours after being seated periodtoken the food is average at best periodtoken","9353":"the food at cafe olivia is really good commatoken the service is not periodtoken  this is a business that cares more about pinching a penny than serving the customer periodtoken  the owner runs the register while another man presumably owner as well barks orders at his workers and refuses to do anything extra even on request periodtoken    once the owners daughter was working the register and i requested extra sauce commatoken she told the man running the pass commatoken however he refused to add the extra sauce commatoken i told her i was happy to pay for it periodtoken  another instance commatoken i asked the owner for extra sauce on the side commatoken she was happy to charge me for the extra sauce commatoken but then insisted that it could not be put on the side commatoken the extra sauce would only have to go on the sandwhich periodtoken     if you dont ask for anything extra or different commatoken you are in good shape and your experience will be fine periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but dont bother them by asking for a side of sauce commatoken it just cant be done","9354":"mcdonalds periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken what do you need to know periodtoken periodtoken   they serve the purpose periodtoken id complain about the inaudible spanish fellow working the drive through but why would i expect much else periodtoken periodtoken","9355":"i think everytime i go here its a scam periodtoken  everything is overpriced and everything is priced periodtoken  its not like the small town farm where can go on a hayride and bring home a buy periodtoken  i mean commatoken unless you want to go broke periodtoken  there are other smaller farms around periodtoken dont get me wrong commatoken its really nice commatoken but paying 1015 for a pie is insane","9357":"feels sort of like a private club periodtoken everyone seems to know each other commatoken which is great if youre a regular periodtoken ok food and drinks commatoken but i felt like i was at somebodys party in their house periodtoken","9360":"i came into this place with pretty high hopes periodtoken we entered around lunch time and there was no one else in the shop commatoken i almost turned around to see if i had the right place periodtoken periodtoken this is the patisserie that everyone talks about commatoken right  on booming maple street so busy you cant find a parking spot commatoken right  ok commatoken so moving on i am welcomed with a case full of beautiful pastries commatoken a vast selection of them to boot periodtoken  oh my eyes were in food porn heaven  not to mention the baker with his european accent that also lures you in periodtoken this man has to make awesome stuff commatoken i mean listen to his accent  how could i possibly choose just one    there is a vast selection commatoken from scones commatoken fresh baked breads commatoken tarts commatoken eclairs commatoken croissants commatoken slices of cakes commatoken petit fours commatoken cannolis commatoken cinnamon rolls commatoken donuts commatoken i could go on forever periodtoken its all there and it all looks amazing periodtoken  well we didnt and decided on a few selections periodtoken periodtoken some fruit tarts commatoken an elcaire filled with vanilla cream commatoken a slice of red velvet commatoken and a croissant periodtoken  it was all so beautiful and we couldnt wait to sink our teeth into the treats periodtoken    the taste well that a something i wasnt expecting periodtoken everything and i mean everything tasted funny periodtoken  i couldnt believe it and was genuinely shocked periodtoken  i wasnt the only one who said this periodtoken  i dont know if it was that the case hadnt been cleaned out in awhile or what it was periodtoken  it all tasted either like it had been frozen commatoken or been in the case looming with the other flavors for quite some time periodtoken  it didnt taste fresh or like it should let me just say that periodtoken     other than the funny taste that i couldnt define the cause of commatoken let me move on   the tarts were topped with slices of kiwi commatoken strawberry commatoken and mandarin periodtoken the cream of the tart was smooth and rich commatoken not sweet periodtoken the crust was good commatoken not great periodtoken   red velvet was dense and moist periodtoken  the icing is not the traditional cream cheese though its more of a whipped cream type periodtoken   croissant was flaky and buttery  the eclair commatoken as it turned out to be commatoken let me explain periodtoken periodtoken we were a bit mislead by the young funky uptown girl behind the counter periodtoken she said it was puffed pastry i asked what the filling was commatoken she said it is vanilla cream i asked if it was cream like cream puff cream she said yes periodtoken  it wasnt periodtoken it was an eclair with bavarian cream periodtoken maybe i didnt speak patisserie well enough for her to translate what i was looking for    it was all fine enough except for the fact that everything had this odd taste to it periodtoken periodtoken everything periodtoken  it made me very sad as i was really looking forward to a knock your socks off bakery experience based on what i heard about this place periodtoken  the staff aka the girl behind the counter was not very helpful and she seemed a bit inconvenienced by us and my lack of being able to make choices within the timeframe she normally allots for customers commatoken even though we were the only ones in the shop periodtoken   while we were there one of the baker men finished a chocolate cake for someone that looked amazing and he went to put it into the front counter cooler commatoken he pulled out a plastic container that had half a sandwich and a strawberry in it and asked the girl why it was in there commatoken she told a story about another person and the fact that she was saving the strawberry periodtoken  hmm maybe this has something to do with the pastries tasting odd   i dont know periodtoken    i might give them a second shot commatoken but i am sad to say i have had better pastries that tasted fresh from other local bakeries periodtoken  pro tip dont approach the counter until you know exactly what you want here if you dont want to feel like the bad kid in class and about to be put in a patisserie time out periodtoken","9361":"been here multiple times and i generally enjoy the selection of yogurt and toppings periodtoken however commatoken i have yet to have an enjoyable customer service experience periodtoken every time i go the associate seems to be more invested in their phone than the people in the store or even cleaning the tables periodtoken","9364":"really underwhelming periodtoken for a place that markets itself as health food commatoken it has about two vegetarian items on the menu periodtoken i had to be creative with substitutions on meat items to make something worth paying money for periodtoken i hate to write bad reviews commatoken  but this is the most overhyped place on yelp that ive seen in nola yet periodtoken","9368":"workers are extremely rude and dont smile commatoken especially one of the creepy managers who walks around in the pm hours and asks to help you mockingly periodtoken food selection isnt bad it is a small store commatoken but they have everything you will need periodtoken however very very very expensive about 3x or 4x more than an average supermarket periodtoken i know city supermarkets are going to be more expensive than suburban ones commatoken but this is much more expensive than the other city supermarkets periodtoken you are better off going to food and friends at 20th and spruce commatoken superfresh at 10th and south commatoken or if you have a car wegmans in cherry hill periodtoken overall rittenhouse market is basically awful periodtoken","9370":"yech   side salad 3 periodtoken50 looked like they got it out of a dumpster periodtoken  watery bolognese sauce had no detectable signs of meat periodtoken  meatball 3 was sawdust tasting periodtoken  service was good but that is all periodtoken  no italian was harmed or would walk near this joint in the preparation of this food periodtoken","9373":"so commatoken i have the same order every time coconut milk tea with extra boba commatoken and thus commatoken i cant speak anything else periodtoken keep that in mind commatoken this is only applicable for milk teas periodtoken  tldr periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  is drink sweetness and customization a major factor for you go to chatime down the street they have much better service too periodtoken  want a fast commatoken meh commatoken ontherunimdrivingonthissideofcampbell boba go to bings periodtoken   want a drink and are super hungry too wtf periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken get your tail to miss saigons already they have periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenedible boba if youre not a boba snob commatoken you wont notice  its really yummy commatoken but honestly any excuse to go to miss saigons is a good excuse periodtoken  so periodtoken bings is periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenan okay boba periodtoken it beats the lowerthanaverage quicklys locations in san francisco commatoken but thats not saying much periodtoken  however commatoken though i truly love tucsons chatime commatoken bings is more consistent with their boba cookin periodtoken chatime boba can be undercooked commatoken overcooked  who knows    boba should be al dente you hooligans periodtoken al dente  yes commatoken chatime can do the i want it 3 periodtoken14159 sweetness or whatever commatoken but i dont really give a shit about that periodtoken i just give a shit about my al dente boba periodtoken okay periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenim okay periodtoken  anyway commatoken bings advantage ends right there periodtoken the service here sucks periodtoken like commatoken consistently sucks periodtoken you only interact with them for 20 seconds max commatoken but its the principle periodtoken if you want to support businesses that care about customer service commatoken go to chatime down the street  their staff is awesome periodtoken and though i harp on their nonal dente boba shenanigans commatoken its usually quite good commatoken and the actual drink itself always superior periodtoken   i recommend chatime overall periodtoken","9375":"surly service and 3 donuts smashed together  with no wax paper  in the bottom of the bag periodtoken i wont make a point of going back periodtoken the only reason im giving 2 stars is because they had a decent selection of donuts available at the time of my visit periodtoken","9376":"food 2 periodtoken5 service 2 periodtoken5 value 2  did not live up to the hype in terms of quality periodtoken pricey and strange little place periodtoken","9377":"the saddest part of this review is that i used to like axis and frequent it all of the time but my last experience was telling periodtoken in ordering a chicken finger platter commatoken i asked for a side caesar salad along with bbq sauce and honey mustard for the fingers periodtoken when i get back to my office and open my meal commatoken i find that instead of the salad commatoken i received chicken noodle soup and instead of bbq sauce commatoken i received maple syrup periodtoken whats even more annoying is that i paid extra for the bbq sauce periodtoken when i call them and tell them of their mistakes commatoken they only offer to remake the salad periodtoken i still had to travel back to the restaurant and exchange my food myself with no reimbursement for my time and inconvenience periodtoken axis commatoken do better periodtoken","9378":"while the staff is funny and nice commatoken the entire place is overrated periodtoken the donuts are too expensive and they arent even that good periodtoken the weekend donuts are hit or miss periodtoken the chicken and waffle donut was really the only donut i felt worth the money and hype periodtoken i love donuts but ill be going elsewhere periodtoken","9381":"food and drink is pretty good but the ordering and flow are very awkward and inconvenient periodtoken heres the typical experience  1 periodtoken stand in line to order from the main counter while you constantly dodge people leaving the restaurant or going to sit on the patio periodtoken   2 periodtoken if you ordered a drink you then go stand in line at the bar and compete with people that are sitting at the bar  people who are ordering their food directly at the bar because they didnt feel they needed to stand in the first line periodtoken all this time you might be holding your silverware and nonalcoholic drinks and your table number sign periodtoken and now youre dodging food runners and people filing up their drinks at the drink station periodtoken   3 periodtoken carry all your stuff to find a table while dodging everybody in the queues  mentioned in step 1 and line 2 periodtoken   if you want another drink repeat step 2 periodtoken  i was excited to hear that local taco had previously converted to table service periodtoken but theyve already reverted back because people complained that service was too slow periodtoken i think instead of reverting back to a bad system they shouldve focused on improving their table service model periodtoken  just my two cents commatoken but i would rather see local taco be a place to go relax and pay someone to run around the place commatoken as opposed to being a chaotic version of chipotle periodtoken","9382":"wow periodtoken i cant believe people have been giving this place 5star reviews periodtoken not that thai tanic is bad periodtoken its just not any good commatoken either periodtoken ive never been bored at a thai restaurant before periodtoken  i knew there was going to be trouble as soon as i saw the menu periodtoken i didnt see a single originallooking dish periodtoken many of the names had been changed from thai to english what is a thai taco periodtoken it didnt look promising periodtoken i should have stuck with that instinct periodtoken  thai food is supposed to have subtle and complex flavors periodtoken thai tanic didnt get the message periodtoken my scallop dish tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and not much else periodtoken the waitress brought a small bowl of red pepper commatoken saying the chef had forgotten to add it to the dish when he cooked it periodtoken my wifes curry was equally unsubtle mostly coconut milk and not enough heat periodtoken our son loved the pad thai commatoken but then hes only 2 years old periodtoken the adults thought it was pretty awful periodtoken  if you want to eat decent thai food commatoken skip this place and go to nadia or thai orchid periodtoken","9384":"honestly i dont get the hype periodtoken wait was incredibly long20 plus minutes for a bagel sandwich and the only compliment is that i can say at least it was food i get sometimes you wait for quality but that doesnt apply here periodtoken do they deep fry the bacon it was crunchy and had a really awkward texture commatoken honestly it was gross periodtoken the bagel itself was ok commatoken not terrible not great just ok periodtoken ill say that the guy cooking on what looked like the worlds smallest griddle was non stop hustling commatoken which made the wait seem even stranger periodtoken im gonna assume the call in orders take priority over customers that actually make the effort to visit the store periodtoken last visit here for sure periodtoken","9386":"so disappointed  our waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu periodtoken we had 2 adults and 3 small kids periodtoken we asked him if 1 large fry would be enough for our family the boys had kids meals commatoken but it dod not say anything about coming with fries and he said probably not so we should order 2 large fries periodtoken boy we we surprised when the kids meals came with fries and we were stuck with an additional 2 orders of large fries periodtoken we also asked for our burgers done medium periodtoken while the burgers were tasty commatoken they were extremely well donecharred periodtoken our waiter didnt come by our table for 15 minutes so we couldnt take them back periodtoken when i mentioned it to him commatoken his response was we have had lots of problemscomplaints with that in the kitchen there was no discount offered or the very least a new burger we will not be back as 80 is way too much money to spend for 2 burnt burgers commatoken 3 orders of chicken fingers  commatoken way too any fries and 2 beers","9387":"we want to love this place commatoken because when the food and service is good commatoken its great however commatoken after many times visiting commatoken they just arent ever able to get it right periodtoken one day the service is fast commatoken the pancakes are cold commatoken and the waffle is gross periodtoken the next time commatoken the food is good and you wait 45 minutes to get it periodtoken if they could consistently get their service and food up to par commatoken on the same days commatoken this would be a solid 4 star breakfast option in indy periodtoken","9389":"extremely disappointed periodtoken i bought their special harry potter red velvet cake with butterbeer frosting slice periodtoken i wouldnt even call it a slice and they charged 10 for this periodtoken i wish i wouldve taken a picture but after splitting it in half with my son i got a whole six small bites of cake periodtoken the picture of the slice they showed on facebook is very deceiving commatoken its that height but cut like a piece of bread not cake periodtoken and the cake itself was dry and i didnt really taste the butterbeer but the frosting was good periodtoken we did also buy an oreo cookie covered with chocolate and a cake pop which we havent tried yet periodtoken i really liked the theming they did for harry potter but i dont think ill be back periodtoken too overpriced for what i got periodtoken","9393":"stopped in tonight for a quick bite before a movie at the ritz and was thoroughly disappointed periodtoken i got the mixed garden vegetable noodle bowl with vermicelli noodles and extra shrimp dumplings periodtoken the broth was so mild it could have doubled as warm water periodtoken i added soy sauce commatoken but the waterbroth was so flavorless the soy was powerless against it periodtoken the vegetables were equally underseasoned commatoken like they were boiled in water and then served periodtoken there was no flavor for the noodles to absorb periodtoken is there no shoyu commatoken garlic commatoken ginger commatoken sesame oil commatoken etc in their kitchen i found myself thinking well commatoken the menu didnt specifically say there would be seasoning periodtoken maybe i was wrong to assume they would add flavor periodtoken my husband suggested that maybe someone in the kitchen mixed up water  broth periodtoken either way commatoken i wont be back periodtoken on a positive note commatoken the movie was excellent  i do highly recommend begin again periodtoken","9394":"just left lee roy selmons periodtoken  how disappointing periodtoken  i got the baby back ribs which were dry and very tough periodtoken","9395":"was here 2nd time periodtoken food below average just boring nothing worth the money egg noodles commatoken simple green beans commatoken and tough pork with mushroom brown gravey periodtoken my wife returned grizzly beef stroganoff got medium burger well done brought home to dog periodtoken 3 aptz nothing great periodtoken there was just no wow effect periodtoken over all not worth 140 periodtoken","9396":"this might just be the saddest liquor store i have entered to date periodtoken  no baskets were in sight periodtoken this left the following options either go back outside and grab a cart commatoken or cling on to your items and hope they dont drop periodtoken because that would be costly and unfortunate periodtoken  beyond the cartbasket situation commatoken maro brothers aka the old joe canals manages to have fairly terrible selection periodtoken youll walk in to florescent lights and wines hanging out in carts rather than on shelves periodtoken i didnt bother to browse the wine periodtoken  i headed over to the beer section commatoken and they were severely lacking in the craft department periodtoken but hey commatoken if youre looking for a case of rolling rock commatoken this is your place  just make sure you have id on you and ready to present for analysis periodtoken ive never seen one store display so many signs about the fact that youre going to get carded periodtoken like commatoken cool commatoken congrats commatoken youre following the law but how about investing in something other than signs  like periodtoken periodtoken say commatoken baskets","9397":"has a nice environment and nice servers but when we were brought our waters i could notice little white specks in the water that looked like someone backwashed the water after eating something periodtoken i asked for another water and yet again it had the white things in it periodtoken after that we ordered our food and i ordered the caesar salad and french fries periodtoken the fries are delicious and the salad was okay but could use more flavor periodtoken as i was eating the salad commatoken i noticed a little piece of blue plastic which was probably from the toothpick they place in the sliders commatoken in my salad commatoken and that was unappetizing periodtoken and to top it all off they forgot my order of fries the first time periodtoken so again great environment and stuff just disappointing and grossed me out periodtoken","9398":"i really wanted the station to be my goto for not working at home commatoken but the noise levels in there can get really loud periodtoken for those used to coffeeshops in the city commatoken its not conducive to work  think more family hangout and chatty meetandgreets as opposed to a place populated with laptops where you can get stuff done even with a pair of earbuds periodtoken  as another reviewer also noted commatoken the music does intrude it included commercials the last time i was there commatoken and the menu is pretty basic periodtoken if you want a place to hang out commatoken i think the station is great with what theyre doing for merchantville periodtoken but as a place to get work done commatoken telecommuters look elsewhere periodtoken  last commatoken ill say that my friends bands have played there a few times commatoken and there was a 10 cover charge periodtoken in merchantville","9399":"id been hearing about wct for about a year periodtoken had seen their truck parked and tried a couple of times to buy some commatoken but it was just their parked truck commatoken no serving periodtoken so i liked them on facebook so i could know in advance where they were going to be periodtoken typically theyre in areas im not or at hours that im sleeping commatoken so i was forced to wait a while periodtoken then they were going to be at butler u commatoken so my family took the stroll over periodtoken the selection was minimal commatoken with 3 choices teriyaki chicken commatoken steak commatoken or periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni dont even remember periodtoken something else periodtoken the tacos were ok commatoken but nothing to write home about periodtoken they sure couldve used a better brand of tortillas because these thin wimpy corn tortillas werent much better than waxed paper periodtoken  overall commatoken i found them fine for truck food if youre drunk or if you have money to burn for a changeofpace lunch thats available right outside of your office periodtoken however commatoken i didnt find them worth the trek or the money if youre wanting a good soft taco periodtoken there are places on or around the 38th street corridor that improve on these considerably periodtoken","9408":"i probably should have gotten the pancakes while at the pancake pantry but since it was later in the day i was really in the mood for lunch periodtoken  i got a turkey bacon wrap and it was extremely sub par periodtoken but i got the soup of the day with it also which was unreal  it was a white bean and ham soup periodtoken","9410":"we tried the derby steeplechase pie and the pecan pie periodtoken  papa c is in love with sugar and light corn syrup the pecan pie and derby steeplechase pie were overpoweringly sweet periodtoken  the crust was crumbly rather than flaky periodtoken  honestly commatoken my own derby pie is superior to papa cs periodtoken  at 7 periodtoken75 for a sixinch pie commatoken these are not a bargain periodtoken","9411":"atmosphere was pretty nice periodtoken boba tea was sealed in plastic cups periodtoken the servers were friendly and attentive periodtoken  what i had issue with was the food itself periodtoken i started out by trying the spicy basil chicken for 12 periodtoken85 periodtoken the presentation was great in a stainless steel bowl commatoken but as i bit into my second piece i quickly realized each bitesized chunk was 65 bone commatoken making my chopsticks useless periodtoken i attempted to eat it by hand but there were just too many little bits of bone hidden and i had to pick apart each piece to scavenge for where the meat was periodtoken one of the pieces was literally a 1x1 piece of spine and ribs periodtoken i asked if it was supposed to be served this way and the server said yes periodtoken i told them the menu did not warn me of this commatoken and that if its the most expensive chicken item in the gourmet section prepared in bitesized chunks of meat commatoken covered in sauce commatoken it makes it very difficult to determine youre going to bit into a piece of meat or bone periodtoken i couldnt finish it periodtoken they agreed to give me halfoff periodtoken  so i ordered something simple periodtoken kung pao chicken periodtoken they had it ready in less than a minute after she went back to the chef commatoken which drew my suspicion periodtoken this time it was brought to me on a simple white plate periodtoken it was a generous serving size for 9 and some change periodtoken unfortunately the amount of salt was much too much periodtoken the mixture was uneven commatoken so one bite might be perfectly fine while another bite was chock full of salt periodtoken one piece of green bell pepper had so much on it i could actually taste the sandy granular texture of the salt crystals periodtoken i felt like a cad commatoken but i couldnt finish it either periodtoken i finished my boba tea and steamed rice without issue and paid 23 for my meal periodtoken  to my surprise one of the cooks came out commatoken and i explained it briefly periodtoken the word is commatoken there are two chefs a good one and a bad one periodtoken the bad one is related to the owner so he cant be let go periodtoken this explained things quickly to me periodtoken it felt like a gordon ramsay moment periodtoken  needless to say im still hungry periodtoken","9412":"after reading review by friends and checking out the menu commatoken i was psyched to go and try the veggie burger and ice cream periodtoken my sister and i decided to head downtown for lunch to check it out periodtoken we always have a hard time deciding where to go but it was easy to decide this time  we walked in and asked to sit upstairs  we agree with erin that the communal table isnt our thing periodtoken we immediately noticed that it was freezing periodtoken both of us were wearing pants and fleeces periodtoken since its a huge open space commatoken we knew asking for some heat wouldnt help periodtoken our waitress came right away and got us waters periodtoken i ordered the root beer on tap commatoken only to be told that there isnt any root beer on tap periodtoken hm commatoken ok periodtoken for such a new place with new menus commatoken that was surprising periodtoken i hope they get it in the future periodtoken there is a huge list of bottled sodas commatoken really interesting ones periodtoken i didnt get one though commatoken decided to stick with water periodtoken   i ordered the veggie burger with fries and the regular ketchup commatoken plus the creamy slaw periodtoken i asked if the slaw had onions because i dont like them and they make me sick periodtoken the waitress said she was pretty sure that it didnt but shed check periodtoken our food came out very quickly periodtoken the first thing i noticed was all the onions in the slaw periodtoken the second was that the veggie burger patty looked very different from any ive seen periodtoken the waitress told us it had beans commatoken nuts commatoken veggies periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but it was pretty plain looking commatoken no veggies apparent periodtoken i scraped the slaw off the burger and took a bite periodtoken the patty was mushy commatoken room

potential with the chemistrymad science gimmick as far as decor commatoken props commatoken colors commatoken dry ice commatoken etc periodtoken 4 periodtoken  probably the most important thing of all is that i did not like the vodka periodtoken  i gave it the old college try periodtoken  i tried it with cranberry commatoken i tried a moscow mule commatoken and i tried a french 76 periodtoken  it all came back to the vodka having an earthy commatoken dirty taste periodtoken  its somewhat smooth as far as the alcohol bite commatoken but its not clean periodtoken  to be fair commatoken my drinking partner liked it periodtoken  she was not bothered by the taste periodtoken i will go back commatoken as i would like to see if i like their rum is any better than their vodka commatoken and i would like to see if there is more to the place in time periodtoken  it would also be nice to see if the bartenders are more personable when they can do more than be at the mercy of an unruly mob of craft cocktail seekers periodtoken","9419":"took our kids there for lunch on a very slow saturday periodtoken we switch table because our had ants all over it periodtoken they were out of the soda we

those periodtoken   the place just comes off as having an identity crisis periodtoken part americas version of mexican food commatoken part bar commatoken and part bakery periodtoken sometimes when you try to do everything commatoken you end up not being able to do any of them really well periodtoken this place has plenty of potential commatoken if they were focused on mexican commatoken and were more authentic periodtoken","9444":"doc bakers used to be one of my favorite places to stop and get lunch and a healthy shot periodtoken previously the staff was warm and very informative

of the asian cuisine around town periodtoken  the prices are higher too periodtoken  i was charged 20 for an order of egg rolls and one of their specials periodtoken  thats crazy periodtoken  ive had the lemongrass chicken bun and it comes with a wide assortment of veggies periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenmore than just the cucumber and carrots you may expect periodtoken  that was nice but again commatoken the portions are small and higher priced than their competitors periodtoken  the moms country fried beef is good commatoken too but sometimes there is too much pepper in the rice

going downhill commatoken recently i went and they were selling costco muffins in the baked goods periodtoken after i wrote a complaint commatoken they started carrying frogs bakery stuff commatoken

the bbq commatoken and a warm bowl of chili periodtoken no spoon commatoken no napkins periodtoken obviously the food was prepared when we ordered it 45 minutes prior periodtoken whats worse is that once we got our food commatoken we still couldnt leave because there were two cars between us and speedway still waiting for their food the guy inside finally came out and asked them to move over to the parking lot so we could leave periodtoken we spent more than one hour in the drive thru periodtoken believe me commatoken the food was definitely not worth that kind of wait periodtoken if i knew id be spending an hour in the drive thru commatoken i would have opted to go dine at olive garden periodtoken when looking inside commatoken there were several employees walking around and talking to each other periodtoken none of which showed any sense of urgency periodtoken they need to seriously rethink how they want to operate their drive thru operation commatoken not to mention the parking lot periodtoken they should reroute the drive thru so that it does not go out to speedway periodtoken makes it very difficult for people who want to park and go inside periodtoken  our visit earlier in the week went slightly better commatoken still spent way too much time in the drive thru commatoken although the bbq sandwich tasted much better and was hot on our first visit commatoken and had

periodtoken  after walking in and seeing the menu commatoken i had to agree periodtoken  similar concept periodtoken  i was amused to see random menu items like crab rangoon commatoken fried pickles and korean beef tacos on a wing menu periodtoken  i decided to order the same meal as i would at wingstop to compare periodtoken  parmesan garlic wings with fries and ranch dressing periodtoken  the combo was 6 periodtoken99 commatoken and an extra 70 cents or so for a large ranch dressing bummer to charge extra for it periodtoken  dinner companion dc ordered the chicken strips in the hot mama sauce commatoken with mashed potato periodtoken  the wings took 10 minutes to cook commatoken and when they came out they looked pretty tempting periodtoken  big pieces of parmesan commatoken but not drowning in sauce periodtoken  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside commatoken just like they should be periodtoken  the size of the wings varied pretty widely periodtoken  i had a 5 piece and 3 were what id consider normal while 2 were considerably smaller periodtoken  i was pretty disappointed with the taste though periodtoken  they werent very flavorful periodtoken  not much garlic at all commatoken and i love garlic periodtoken  the fries were just plain fries with some seasoned salt periodtoken periodtoken not the magical awesomeness of wingstop fries periodtoken    dc was kind enough to let me try his boneless wings a rarity commatoken to talk him into sharing  they were strangely thin pieces of chicken commatoken in almost a tempura type batter periodtoken  bonus points for that commatoken since most breaded tenders are overwhelmingly breaded periodtoken  the hot mama sauce was pretty good commatoken started out with a sweet honey taste and quickly transitioned over to a heat periodtoken  too spicy for me im a total spice wimp but a tasty few bites periodtoken  overall commatoken dc and i agreed we still like wingstop better for now periodtoken  ill go back commatoken because a its so much closer commatoken b  i have a thing for fried pickles and c i want to try out the thai chili lime flavor periodtoken","9513":"ate here with my wife a few days ago when we were on vacation periodtoken the atmosphere is cool but the food left both of us with some pretty bad stomach issues periodtoken the cole slaw and the salad were likely the culprits

classic grilled chicken sandwich but chicken was still pink periodtoken she also ordered waffle fries that were cold and soggy periodtoken i ordered rice and beans and corn and they were cold

people working periodtoken","9517":"i really dont know why i keep coming to this location periodtoken  the staff is unfriendly commatoken the food tastes old 710 times commatoken and it is usually just a bad experience periodtoken  the few times the food is hot it is great periodtoken  just wish it would be like that more often periodtoken","9518":"we must have come here on an off night periodtoken off the three appetizers and 7 entrees we ordered only a few of the items were good periodtoken the meat was over done commatoken the entrees were bland commatoken and the appetizers were nothing special periodtoken i have two stars for the service and drinks which were good periodtoken","9520":"since a lot of people have made comments about the poor service here commatoken ill start off by saying that our service was very good periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken i cant say too many positive things about the food periodtoken  my kids both ordered from the childrens menu periodtoken my 5 year old loved her corn dog commatoken and the crinkly fries were really good periodtoken  my 8 year old had the kids rib plate commatoken which was a basket of 3 ribs and fries periodtoken  each meal came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream commatoken which was actually quite good periodtoken  my daughter said the ribs were ok periodtoken  my husband had a half rack commatoken sweet potato fries and beans periodtoken  i had a texas beef sandwich and sweet potato fries periodtoken  my husband wasnt at all enthused over the ribs periodtoken  i had a taste and i had to agree periodtoken  mediocre at best periodtoken  his sweet potato fries commatoken like mine commatoken were greasy and tasted like theyd been fried in old grease periodtoken  my texas beef sandwich was not half bad periodtoken  the sauces were pretty good commatoken but nothing special periodtoken  now commatoken about an hour or so later commatoken my husband and i both have upset stomachs periodtoken  we wont return periodtoken  there are too many other places in the area to eat periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwhy waste our time on mediocrity","9521":"before trying this restaurant  commatoken everything in me wanted to give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars based on the pictures  reviews  periodtoken  periodtoken  periodtoken sadly  commatoken i can not do that  periodtoken our hostess was unkind but i can get over that  periodtoken as for the food  commatoken i thought the veggie burger sounded fantastic and even thought it tasted pretty good until the last few bites  periodtoken started feeling sick right away  periodtoken also ordered the onion rings as an appetizer  commatoken they left little to be desired  periodtoken very bland tasting  periodtoken   if i were to go back  commatoken i would give the milkshakes a try and thats it  periodtoken","9525":"after seeing the reviews here commatoken im feeling kind alone but this location of the bakery is just plain disappointing periodtoken  in the past commatoken as a frequent rtm shopper and fan commatoken id sometimes give in to the need and buy something from their counter periodtoken  pretty much every time its mediocre or bad periodtoken  my family has grown to shelf the termini reputation periodtoken its no longer a treat periodtoken  in recent years commatoken someone converted me back but through their original location on 8th st periodtoken  wow periodtoken  that place is incredible commatoken so now i have to convince my whole family its the original location thats still good periodtoken  theyre skeptical periodtoken  this campaign has lowered my guard and once again while shopping at the terminal i decided to pick up a last minute dessert for my familys sunday get together periodtoken  fail periodtoken  no one wanted to finish the first few slices of the chocolate cheese cake i brought periodtoken  i thought my sister was on a diet or something when she only took one bite periodtoken  eventually my familys polite mode wore off a record 3 minutes and they were pretty liberal with their critique of the cake periodtoken  playdoh was perhaps the most agreeable for the table commatoken thats what the cake tasted like periodtoken  i admit commatoken it was nasty periodtoken  how do you have a name like termini and not pull off a basic cheese cake  i had a decent maccaroon while waiting there but otherwise im sorry i didnt just go the the super market periodtoken  and that folks commatoken is the ultimate insult commatoken no  anyone know why in the world this location has become the bizzarroworld bakery of the original location  perhaps they should just be the termini bros periodtoken cannoli depot and stick to the apparent success of that periodtoken","9527":"this particular location was awful first and last time ill go there periodtoken i ordered a specialty bagel sandwich it came out cold periodtoken when i asked them to heat it commatoken the guy who was clearly the manager rudely blamed me for not hearing my name periodtoken i told him whether i heard him or not commatoken the cheese was a cold unmelted slab commatoken so it had never been warm to begin with periodtoken he continued to throw me attitude commatoken while a very nice employee mouthed a quiet apology commatoken and heated it for me periodtoken later while heading to the filthy bathroom commatoken i overheard the employees arguing with this sad excuse of a manager periodtoken this would be one star  except for the kind employee who took pity on the customer periodtoken","9530":"maybe it was because i got my sandwich during the bike race commatoken but it was just completely underwhelming periodtoken  understuffed and overpriced breakfast sandwiches on a soft commatoken boring roll periodtoken  dont see what all the hype is about periodtoken  havent had the water ice but told its underwhelming periodtoken","9531":"its was 640pm and they had the doors locked to the dining room periodtoken we awkwardly made eye contact with the employees inside working periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken then two little kids came and opened the

periodtoken we just got two tacos and left periodtoken","9534":"servicesomewhat confusing when you order at the counter and not the register but owners and workers are very friendly periodtoken   foodvery low quality and not very appetizing periodtoken the beef in the gyro collapsed in my mouth like tofu and the basmati rice didnt taste very traditional periodtoken the beef isnt sliced like a traditional gyro but cut in a elongated tube shape periodtoken the food tastes microwaved and it comes out too fast for comfort periodtoken   atmospherehas a very homey feel that makes you comfortable periodtoken   locationnot the best because it is in the middle of green hills but the traffic on that side of town is usually pretty horrific periodtoken   staff everyone was very friendly commatoken productive commatoken attentive commatoken and they were all around good folks periodtoken   overall i would go back if the food was good  but unfortunately i was only impressed by the service periodtoken","9535":"took a long time and the person at the drive through wasnt very nice periodtoken also i dont go to panera in general very often bc when i hear the total for my order and get ready to actually pay commatoken i kick myself bc the price is far too high for what you get periodtoken how did i end up here and why am i paying 12 for a half of a salad commatoken half a sandwich and some tea","9536":"i wanted to be a fan commatoken but this strange donut was not what i expected periodtoken   their dough is oddly similar to the local grocery store variety periodtoken it doesnt really have that melt in your mouth consistency commatoken plus their apple filled commatoken peanut butter topping was raw inside periodtoken strange for a relatively successful business touting great tasting delectables   their chocolate covered jelly filled is really more cake than jelly commatoken and sadly commatoken i cant even remember the last donut i ate was periodtoken   so for 19 periodtoken00 a dozen commatoken id rather just pay 8 for a dozen at the local grocery store periodtoken id get the same donuts there commatoken and fully cooked  ive read mixed reviews about strange

establishment periodtoken there was only one cashier with a long line periodtoken ridiculous periodtoken he was going very slow commatoken almost as if he was trying to be slow periodtoken  i also work in the food industry and ive dealt with very long lines and you have to be fast and accurate to make the morning rush a success periodtoken well commatoken he was doing neither periodtoken  everytime i come here commatoken theres only one cashier periodtoken thats just going to piss off customers periodtoken  decent hash browns periodtoken","9545":"this place gave me high expectations and it really did not live up periodtoken the atmosphere was relaxing at the bar where my wife and i ate our dinner periodtoken the selections of burgers was outstanding commatoken and i really like how they have a contest every week with different burgers periodtoken a faceoff where the most ordered burger moves on to the next week where a new challenger awaits periodtoken the sides were very good and the beer list gets a thumbs up from me too periodtoken the problems was the actual burger periodtoken i am not even sure if it still on the menu commatoken but i just didnt get it periodtoken it left me desiring more periodtoken maybe i made the wrong choice commatoken which might be easy to do since there are so many options periodtoken ill try this place again and see how i feel about it periodtoken but after one visit i wasnt thinking about the next time i would be back commatoken i was thinking about a different burger place to try periodtoken","9546":"la colombe is philadelphias favorite nonstarbucks roaster commatoken and i just dont get it periodtoken  the cafe itself is sleek and cool  you see less laptops here and more newspapers commatoken which is a nice change of pace periodtoken  conveniently located near rittenhouse commatoken they are in the perfect spot for tourists and businessmen alike periodtoken  that aside commatoken i moonlight as a barista from time to time commatoken and i personally think the beans are nothing to write home about periodtoken  quality has definitely gone down over the past few years commatoken likely due to higher quantities of beans being roasted periodtoken  i find that the brewed coffee leaves a bitter commatoken dry taste in my mouth  not unlike starbucks periodtoken  the espresso is better commatoken but still not as great as i would have expected periodtoken  id agree with a previous reviewer as to the beans being roasted way too dark periodtoken  in fact commatoken the key to lcs success has probably been locally producing a product thats still better commatoken but not much more commatoken than starbucks periodtoken  ill give them 2 stars because i will drink it most independent cafes serve it commatoken but there are better roasters in the philadelphia area chestnut hill coffee commatoken fonseca coffee commatoken etc periodtoken","9549":"ok periodtoken  this place was a turn off periodtoken periodtokenso i left periodtoken  what turned me off was the  with the captain ds atmosphere periodtoken  if im paying 40 for an entree i would at least want the wait staff to not have on t shirts periodtoken  it was a no go","9551":"we took our family of 4 to eat here  found the seating situation inside to be tremendously unaccommodating for families w small children periodtoken specifically children that are in high chairs periodtoken it was cramped periodtoken although the giant family style table in the middle looks cool commatoken the bar height seating isnt ideal for a kid in a hair chair or a toddler really periodtoken i like that there is an option to go through a drive through but ive never found food to travel as well as it tastes fresh periodtoken unfortunately commatoken because of that commatoken ill likely not go often periodtoken the food that we had was good though periodtoken","9554":"the cashier told me my 20 off pads or tampons had been automatically applied from my extra care card commatoken and that she could use 5 of extra bucks periodtoken neither of these was applied periodtoken she did adjust the price of a box of cheerios for me commatoken because someone forgot to take down the promo tag from the previous week commatoken but im a bit upset about the 20 off periodtoken the extra bucks i can use another time commatoken but im not sure ill be needing to buy more feminine hygiene products before this coupon expires periodtoken","9556":"a lot of people in jenkintown seem to love this place commatoken but im not impressed periodtoken the bagels are soso and they are extremely over priced periodtoken i am really picky with bagels and these just dont make the cut periodtoken if you like ny style bagels commatoken this is definitely not the place for you periodtoken they also make bread and have day old bread and bagels at a reduced price periodtoken if youre in jenkintown and craving a bagel commatoken there really arent many options as i am not a fan of breugers across the street either periodtoken","9557":"this casual seafood restaurant is situated in an atmospheric spot at the end of the pier in santa barbara and had

overall commatoken weve found the quality of food in the santa barbara restaurants to be amazing commatoken but i wouldnt recommend this place periodtoken","9561":"2 periodtoken5 i should preface this

a bunch of guys standing around a table periodtoken  since the weather is still nice in the midwest commatoken most people were just waiting for an outside table periodtoken  we elected to go inside periodtoken  ambience alright commatoken i know some places are dark commatoken but you may have needed night vision to see my wife and i as least where they sat us periodtoken  i know this place is a pub and all commatoken but it smelled pretty bad periodtoken  the place smelled like a dirty dish towel periodtoken    menu menu had your typical bar food appetizers commatoken burgers and sandwiches commatoken etc periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  they did have a few entrees pastas and such commatoken and some yourkshire favorites shepperds pie commatoken bangers and mash periodtoken  nothing

and seemed to interrupt at odd points of the evening commatoken but still a nice guy periodtoken  food we started out the evening with some black bean nachos periodtoken  the nachos were good commatoken and loaded with black beans periodtoken  it was nice because they layered it properly commatoken as opposed to having the top layer commatoken and nothing below periodtoken  my wife ordered the portabello sandwich commatoken i got the bangers and mash sausage commatoken mashed potatoes commatoken and peas commatoken  my one coworker got the sheperds pie commatoken and my other coworker

periodtoken  it didnt help that the place smelled commatoken but it was just ok periodtoken  im sure the outdoor seating is really nice during the summer commatoken but this place just didnt do it for

table in the bar area periodtoken that was the worst place that we couldve been seated because our waiter was the bartender commatoken the only bartender periodtoken he was nice and friendly but his visits to our table were few and far between and we had extremely long waits while waiting for things commatoken like our food commatoken our checks commatoken our drinks commatoken our refills commatoken and everything else that we asked him for to add insult to injury commatoken there were constantly groups of 45 employees circulating around the bar area commatoken talking and laughing but

bartenderwaiter after waiting for another 20 minutes for him to come back to our table to collect the payments i mean seriously where is the help  the food at cheddars is good and the prices are great

audacity to add an 18 gratuity to a 2 person bill  they were pretty unbelievable periodtoken  it seemed like it was a motherdaughter operation because speaking from a lifetime career of management nobody would ever keep a surly employee like that around unless they were family periodtoken  but heres a newsflash commatoken simpson house  if you dont want people using groupon gift certificates commatoken stop advertising with groupon  the idea of groupon is to find new customers commatoken not chase them off with bad attitudes periodtoken  its really a shame that we experienced this because

periodtoken","9613":"extremely disappointed with the crawfish here periodtoken  i think they use the same water when doing new boils periodtoken  theyre too spicy and the flavor isnt there at all periodtoken  the only good thing about it was they were decent size which is why im giving it a 25 instead of a 1 periodtoken  if you want good commatoken flavorful crawfish that isnt overly spicy you should check out schaefers on lake avenue periodtoken  they are the best crawfish that you can get from a commercial establishment periodtoken  if you pay with cash you will receive a discount too periodtoken  i will never be back to fishermans cove again periodtoken","9614":"i arrived at 5 am and asked what was fresh periodtoken the lady behind the counter gave me a confused look commatoken and waved her hand at the donuts in the case periodtoken i asked about the donuts on the cooling rack commatoken she implied they were all the same periodtoken i am pretty sure the maple bar i got from the case was cooked the previous day periodtoken it wasnt soft enough to be baked that morning periodtoken the also do not offer a french crueler commatoken so whats the point","9615":"i chose to

they have listed on their site are definitely outdated periodtoken those items together came to almost 30 periodtoken00 periodtoken the samosas were decent commatoken but the seasoning was a little on the overpowering side periodtoken the pakoras were cold and not very good at all commatoken and the raita pretty much tasted like bland yogurt water periodtoken yuck periodtoken another peeve was that i ordered the chicken tikka masala  which was 14 on its own periodtoken generally commatoken anytime i order this commatoken a side of rice is included periodtoken this was just a small plastic bowl of mostly sauce with maybe a cup of chicken chunks in it periodtoken seriously what am i supposed to do commatoken drink the sauce i wouldnt have ordered the side of yogurt water which there was alot of had i known id have no rice to put it on periodtoken ill never go here again  another girlfriend of mine and i dined at an indian joint on friday night last week commatoken got twice as much food commatoken and only paid 45 for the both of us periodtoken dont waste your hardearned  on this crap periodtoken  february 15 commatoken 2011","9616":"probably the worst casino in the nation periodtoken no free drinks when you sit at the tables commatoken i was playing at a table for almost 2 hours commatoken i was down a lot and asked for comps to use for a drink periodtoken they took my card and came back after 20 minutes just to tell me i couldnt get anything and to try again in an hour periodtoken long lines at the cashier on weekends commatoken and bad service periodtoken i wish there was another casino on this area periodtoken","9617":"dined there yesterday and was a little disappointed by how dirty the restaurant was periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbbq sauce carrier and menus were sticky with caked on grease and sticky fingerprints commatoken my water came out with an ant on the lemon wedge commatoken the mason jar my beer came in had lip prints on the rim commatoken and the booth itself had crumbs all over it as if it hadnt been wiped down in days periodtoken fortunately the food was still tasty commatoken but it kind of makes you wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen when the front of house is so dirty periodtoken","9618":"never seen such high beef prices in my life periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they have more than doubled their prices over the last year periodtoken price gouging at its finest periodtoken nice produce though periodtoken","9619":"im sorry but i really hated this place periodtoken i wanted to like it with the massive amount of great reviews commatoken but everything i had was incredibly mediocre periodtoken   i know its americanized commatoken and it was done fairly poorly periodtoken  i got the sesame chicken and they were extremely soggy and the sauce tasted like no other sesame chicken ive ever had periodtoken it tasted like someone dumped a bottle of mauls on it periodtoken   the crab rangoon tasted like it lacked the crab part commatoken and was just cream cheese shoved in periodtoken  i wont try it again periodtoken","9620":"so in trying to decide where i was going to find some delicious treats for my wife for her 40th birthday i read some yelp reviews on this place and thought i would give it a try periodtoken  i read all of the reviews here that said you had to try the puff tart or something so that made me lean towards here periodtoken  also my wife likes macaroons and all of the macaroon slangers have convinced her just how vital it is to have macaroons come in a snazzy little box periodtoken  they sell those too so my choice was made periodtoken  i walk in and ask for the puff tart thing periodtoken    oh no sir we do not have any of those today those are labor intensive we do not make those just any day periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  umm periodtoken periodtoken okay periodtoken  i could not imagine a italian restaurant that advertises an excellent veal parmesan and then when i order it they tell me it is too labor intensive to make and they did not feel like making it today so instead just order the spaghetti periodtoken    ok fine i see you have some macaroons periodtoken  ill take a dozen thrown in those little macaroon boxes the ladies love so much periodtoken  oh sir we are out of macaroon boxes but we can throw a dozen in a brown paper bag for you periodtoken  really  i thought this was supposed to be part of the presentation or at least most people argue it is periodtoken  ok just throw some in a brown bag commatoken if it is not too much to ask perhaps one without a hole in it periodtoken  ok along with that ill have a peanut butter cupcake periodtoken    we dont have any of those periodtoken  sure you do right there pointing at sign that says peanut butter cupcake  oh sir we have been waaaay too busy this morning making cupcakes to change our signs periodtoken  that sign is wrong that is a different cupcake periodtoken    um ok just give me that one i guess periodtoken  as far as the taste for everything i got  ehh it was fine periodtoken  look we are talking about cupcakes and peanut butter bars at a pretty incredible price so i think it should be worlds better than an okay cupcake periodtoken  more than anything i think they should carry everything they make periodtoken  just as i was writing this review i thought well in fairness perhaps it is not on their menu on their website commatoken maybe it is more of a specialty item periodtoken  just checked commatoken nope it s there periodtoken  perhaps they should put an asterisk beside of it that denotes it is labor intensive to make such a treat and they have them in stock from time to time when they feel like making them","9621":"if you are a die hard gambler then the hard rock will fit the bill periodtoken im more into tangible spending but have dropped a few  in the slots periodtoken when i come here its usually with out of town

walk about a mile you will find its a bit cleaner and newer towards the hotel side periodtoken   lots of slot machines and poker rooms for your donating er um gambling pleasure periodtoken","9622":"good food but terrible service periodtoken i can only put half the blame on the staff as they were shorthanded commatoken but needed to express a better attitude toward customers and focus on getting orders correct and out on time periodtoken orders kept coming out duplicated commatoken cold commatoken or completely wrong periodtoken","9623":"lunch buffet is gross and has not much variety periodtoken chicken tikka masala is campbells tomato soup base periodtoken they replenish buffet by dumping bowls of refill into trays commatoken not replacing the whole tray periodtoken ambiance is pretty so its a shame periodtoken its basically indian fast food periodtoken","9624":"seriously i dont get what people like about this place periodtoken its over priced groceries periodtoken you can get the same things at trader joes for a fraction of the price periodtoken sure theres hot mamas in yoga pants shopping here but they aint coming home to cook for me so whatever periodtoken i rather spend my money on other markets that price things fairly then go here where omg commatoken its organic commatoken so let me just jack up the price arbitrarily periodtoken that said commatoken ill give this place an extra star for having a delicious caf\u00e9 periodtoken","9625":"food was fresh and good periodtoken even though there were hardly any customers commatoken service was slow periodtoken lots of conversation between staff periodtoken","9626":"im not a huge rum fan but ive had really great mojitos before so i said id try my husbands before i ordered one for me periodtoken  it was ok but not worth raving about so the waitress said commatoken i dont have to make it with rum commatoken i can use vodka mmm periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenok honestly commatoken i think that was a mistake periodtoken it was fine but also meh periodtoken the salad i ordered had an entire avocado sliced over it and it wasnt quite ripe  a ripe avocado would have made the difference periodtoken  the dressing was fresh tasting but a teeny cup was all i was given periodtoken the fish tacos had store bought soft tacos which were lackluster and very wet cole claw under the fish which was tilapia periodtoken i ended up just eating the insides as the tacos themselves had no taste and fell apart from the liquid periodtoken  there was a teeny cup of guacomole which i could make so much better and there was so little salsa picante i couldnt really review it periodtoken the waitress who also filled as the bartender forgot our water commatoken delivered hubbys tortilla soup dull a long while before my salad arrived commatoken forgot my drink order also for a long time and when i asked for a second teeny cup of guacomole she said commatoken sure and never delivered it periodtoken she was friendly and apologetic for every wrong turn but with the cost of dining out which we love to do commatoken we wont be back periodtoken","9627":"this place has all the breakfast basics commatoken so nothing really special periodtoken i ordered the 2 egg omelette with asparagus and prosciutto  the asparagus was tiny and did not contain any spears but the prosciutto was adequate periodtoken i do not eat bread so i asked for a substitute for my toast periodtoken the server refused any substitute saying that it just comes out of the kitchen that way  fine periodtoken there are maybe 11 tables in this very small space so she could have literally walked two paces to the cook and asked him for options  but i was told i could just not eat the toast periodtoken my husband had the seafood benedict which was served on a biscuit instead of an english muffin so that was a unique offering periodtoken however commatoken the hollandaise sauce was excessively citrusy periodtoken the food wasnt necessarily bad but overpriced for what it was and there are many better places in the french quarter periodtoken","9628":"i  was really disappointed with my dinner periodtoken the escargots were served with what i assume were canned artichoke hearts and parmesan periodtoken that unusual combination masked the delicate flavor of the escargots and made the dish way too salty periodtoken next commatoken i got the 20 beef bourguignon that tasted just like the pot roast at dennys  except that dennys is cheaper and comes with mashed potatoes periodtoken it was served with two pieces of bread not on the side but on the edge of the plate periodtoken that would have been ok until i found hidden under the bread one of those rectangles of butter wrapped in foil periodtoken as the butter melted commatoken it began to slide into my dish periodtoken kind of funny actually periodtoken oh commatoken yeah commatoken the bourguignon also contained little pieces of undercooked potatoes commatoken something i pointed out to the waitress periodtoken my daughter had mussels marinieres that were not too bad but with the addition of basil commatoken they didnt taste anything like french moules marinieres commatoken at least not the ones ive had in france periodtoken on the positive side commatoken the desserts du jour were good and our server very pleasant periodtoken i wont go back though periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9629":"oh commatoken this place has potential periodtoken   the baked goods are delicious commatoken the service is not excellent commatoken and the business owners dont seem interested in improving what they are providing periodtoken   after confusion about who to give my order to commatoken i reached the register periodtoken i told the young man at the register that i would like whichever of the soups was vegetarian periodtoken he rang me up periodtoken when my food was delivered at the table commatoken i specifically asked if the soup was vegetarian periodtoken two women who delivered the food said it was periodtoken  it was not periodtoken they served a vegetarian chicken soup even after being specifically asked about it periodtoken   i sent the soup back commatoken and then had my meal interrupted an additional 23 times by their employees periodtoken because their mistake necessitates them interrupting my meal to unpleasantly pseudoapologize periodtoken  some excuses given we have a lot of new girls working here periodtoken i gave my order to a man periodtoken also commatoken you told me the soup was vegetarian when you delivered it we ran out of the soup so we substituted another periodtoken  at this point i replied that i would have understood it if the cashier had told me that they were out of the vegetarian soup periodtoken   i understand mistakes happen in food service commatoken but the buck needs to stop somewhere periodtoken its not okay to serve people food they have been specifically asked not to periodtoken i would not recommend trusting this restaurant with a food allergy or sensitivity problem periodtoken   i hope this bakery can step up to the plate periodtoken","9630":"i know pancake pantry is a staple of the nashvillain touristy breakfast stops but i gotta say periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken its just not that great periodtoken  the line around the block is offputting and the service is pretty brash periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the main goal is to get you in and get you out and this is definately made obvious by the servers periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  foodwise they have pretty amazing sweet potato pancakes that are really pretty righteous periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but not good enough to justify the line around the block or the hassle of going there periodtoken    when i first moved here commatoken it was a spot we went to regularly but to me now it is clearly a tourist stop to be avoided periodtoken","9631":"usually my sandwich is good but today it was terrible periodtoken ordered number 16 periodtoken even if its crowded i need my sandwich to come out good cheese and peppers fully covering the sandwich as i should periodtoken","9632":"we did the tour today and were disappointed for the amount we paid periodtoken  we had a groupon and paid 79 periodtoken  we made a total of 4 stops and tried jambalaya commatoken gumbo commatoken muffiletta and a brisket po boy periodtoken  the samples are fairly small periodtoken  our tour guide was preston and he told the group multiple times he has been doing the job for three weeks commatoken yet through other reviews it appears he has been doing tours for several months periodtoken his facts were not very accurate and he was a bit offensive to almost everyone in the group periodtoken  i would not recommend this tour periodtoken all of the foods we tried are easy to find and you will pay less to try them on your own periodtoken groupon has other deals to get a walking tour and the information will be more accurate and entertaining periodtoken","9633":"always seen this restaurant and never stop so today my husband and i decided to give it a try periodtoken  came in through a store which was quite busy and had some interesting things periodtoken  i may pick up on the way out periodtoken  got seated promptly and waited five minutes for our server lacey to take our drink orders periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken she asked if we were also ready to order food but i explained this was our first  time dining here so instead of giving highlights she walked off periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken when she came back 5 min later with our drinks and proceeded to take our oder periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken walked off and never returned to refill our drinks coffee and water periodtoken   we had to ask another server  for that periodtoken  the next time she came back 15 min later was to bring food periodtoken  the manager walked pass our table asking others how were their dining experience guess our opinion didnt matter periodtoken  well lets get to the food  food was subpar we both ordered the smoke house breakfast periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the only thing from this dish that was good was the biscuits  both of our grits were under cooked periodtoken my eggs were fried and chopped there version of scrambled and the gravy was bland periodtoken  maybe this was an off day but i wasnt impressed if i come back i will definitely try something new and if this location i would need a different server periodtoken","9634":"too sugary and too sweet i know commatoken i know commatoken a cupcake is a dessert and has sugar etc etc periodtoken  but these do not have a good balance i had the pumpkin patch commatoken here comes the bride commatoken and the happy birthday to me chocolate periodtoken  pumpkin was the best of the three but mediocre periodtoken  the birthday chocolate tasted like out of a boxspeaking of a friend who used to work in the cupcake business said flying cupcakes are from a boxi hope this isnt true but either way please fix the taste and balance i do not anticipate a return in the near future and this will not be a goto for me periodtoken","9635":"we had a pick up order for lunch and the service at the pick up counter was great periodtoken she checked and made sure that all the food was there and added extra silverware and stuff periodtoken but food on the other hand was not very good periodtoken we had the chips and dip and the dip tasted like it had mayo in it and should have been on a sandwich periodtoken the bread was stringy like it had hair or something in it periodtoken the nachos were gooey and not very good either periodtoken i probably wont go again especially for pick up periodtoken","9636":"i ordered the snow crab legs  gulf shrimp dinner periodtoken  the crab leg cluster was worse than youd get at red lobster periodtoken very small commatoken skinny crab legs that didnt have much meat periodtoken the shrimp were overcooked  rubbery periodtoken    i would recommend avoiding this touristtrap of a restaurant periodtoken    i asked the waitress about the craft beers available commatoken and all she told me was theyre ales periodtoken well commatoken yes i could see that on the menu but she wasnt able to offer up any recommendations or helpful information periodtoken","9637":"my friend and i both ordered a burger and a shake periodtoken the food was decent commatoken but portions were small periodtoken apparently commatoken we also ordered food poisoning to go periodtoken that was an extremely fun experience periodtoken","9638":"i was so disappointed periodtoken last time i was here the food was exquisite periodtoken today i ordered the shrimp ceviche and the lobster tacos periodtoken if i got more than three whole shrimps it will be a miracle periodtoken the lobster tacos were less than mediocre periodtoken tortilla was not fresh and dry periodtoken very little lobster in the tacos and the cream salsa was way over spicy inedible periodtoken the spanish rice was not at all fluffy periodtoken it was hard and beyond dry periodtoken 80 for poor food is upsetting periodtoken the service was slow and un attentive periodtoken again commatoken very disappointed  i will need to find another seafood place","9639":"the tables are filthy periodtoken  i wiped one off with a napkin and it was black when i got done periodtoken  its always very cold in there commatoken management is too cheap or lazy to turn the heat up in the winter periodtoken  the food could be much better periodtoken","9640":"ordered take out from here periodtoken the person at the bar acted put out by us coming to pick up our order periodtoken the food was ok periodtoken it would probably be better to eat at the restaurant periodtoken","9641":"awwww dang periodtoken i so wanted to feel at home here since i live on willow and can walk over in 2 minutes periodtoken i use about 110 of an ounce of nondairy in my coffee periodtoken soy commatoken coconut milk commatoken whatever periodtoken buddy wants 1 periodtoken00 for my splash periodtoken what about us vegans out here who like coffee periodtoken get with the times and we will be back periodtoken","9642":"every single time i order coffee here through the drive through its horrible or  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they get it wrong periodtoken i order the same thing every time and one or another of the employees cant understand simple ingredients or instructions and i get raspberry commatoken or something else completely different from what i say commatoken or periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the coffee itself is just brewed horribly finally commatoken after giving it one last try  i believe in second commatoken even third chances  they messed up again  periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and in the very least the manager very nice lady gave me my money back periodtoken never went back again periodtoken this branch also owns the one in tampa on dale mabry periodtoken i prefer the service at that location way better periodtoken never got a bad cup there periodtoken always perfect periodtoken","9643":"does it smell bad yep periodtoken but most places with that much fresh fish arent going to smell great periodtoken the produce was pretty good commatoken lots of selections and 95 of it looked really fresh commatoken the other 5 not so much periodtoken lots of spices and different meats to choose from periodtoken the pork and beef periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i have my suspicions on it periodtoken if i bought it i would only cook it well done periodtoken the fish periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken ah yes the fish periodtoken they have some live ones periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and some dead ones floating in the live tank periodtoken periodtoken oops periodtoken lots of selection on the fresh fish commatoken mullet commatoken sheepshead commatoken croaker commatoken blue fish commatoken ribbon fish commatoken salmon commatoken catfish commatoken tilapia etc periodtoken i say fresh because you can tell its all frozen or previously frozen and some of it has that ive been dead too long look in their glassy frozen fish eyes periodtoken we elected to go with with the still alive catfish periodtoken got 3 of them and the hispanic gentlemen made a chopping motion that i assumed meant chop their heads off i said yes and was rewarded with the catfish cut into oblivion commatoken thrown in a bag and priced periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but probably my fault periodtoken anyway took em home commatoken skinned em commatoken and made nuggets periodtoken these arent american catfish its obvious both by the look commatoken smell and the stain on the meat that these bad boys come from asia periodtoken not worth the price and the taste eh periodtoken will i go back maybe periodtoken periodtoken but only if im driving by and need to blow a few minutes periodtoken","9644":"pros  family friendly commatoken convenient location commatoken great crowd commatoken clean and no drunks in the restaurant during the day  cons service is horrible commatoken a little too expensive commatoken waiterswaitresses pretend youre not there commatoken the space is small and crammed commatoken do not expect to get your food served right when it is ready commatoken and if you ask something to the waiterwaitress they will get an attitude and get offended like you are inconveniencing them periodtoken dont get the french toast  conclusion  if you want to sit down and take a break from the walking and etc periodtoken commatoken this establishment should be not the last choice but one not your first periodtoken","9645":"overrated commatoken never wait in line for this periodtoken pretty disappointing periodtoken i swear theyre slinging bisquick pancakes periodtoken tourist trap periodtoken","9646":"perhaps it was an off night commatoken given that this is reportedly a popular place periodtoken  sometimes seems that if a restaurant is in a trendy neighborhood commatoken it just gives up on trying periodtoken service wasnt  helpful commatoken  the tables were dirty commatoken and the food was mediocre periodtoken  this review is from a visit this summer periodtoken  we havent been back periodtoken","9647":"take out periodtoken the food was ready in 15 minutes periodtoken the thai basil stir fry with chicken was very watery commatoken too spicy commatoken not flavorful periodtoken there was so much liquid in the dish that my side of rice was not able to soak everything up periodtoken this is not what i expected to see periodtoken it was spicier than i expected as well  on the phone the restaurant said it was a little spicy periodtoken i think the extra spice hid the fact that the dish was not flavorful periodtoken it was almost as if the stir fry was done half heartedly and then water was added after the fact periodtoken  maybe with another dish or dining in the food quality would be better periodtoken im willing to give this place another try but i was not impressed with what i had periodtoken","9648":"while i love chipotle for their fresh and healthy ingredients commatoken this location consistently disappoints on cleanliness periodtoken every table is dirty as is the floor commatoken the trash is full and a few employees have been hanging out talking not doing much periodtoken seems theres not a standard for keeping the front of the house clean which is not a welcome sight when entering or looking for a place to sit periodtoken","9649":"second time ive been here since it opened periodtoken  this place is disappointing commatoken period periodtoken  for a brewerytap house commatoken with the prices their menu demands commatoken whoever is running their kitchens doesnt have a clue periodtoken  it is a dilemma to xhoose something from their menu that doesnt sound gross periodtoken and a fourteen dollar cheeseburger is absolute robbery periodtoken  as for the beer commatoken i didnt like any i drank the first rime commatoken so now im drinking iced tea periodtoken  to the owners if you want to see a menu in your price range that doesnt suck commatoken go eat at brickhouse and steal the person who desined their menu periodtoken  very disappointed periodtoken","9650":"lunch for 3 was almost 40 periodtoken00 periodtoken my large size chicken w noodle dish had 4 tiny pieces of chicken in it periodtoken and it was overcooked periodtoken  the meal did not come with a smile none could be found among the entire commatoken almost angry looking staff periodtoken  wont be going back periodtoken","9651":"the good this brisket is so tender it nearly falls apart commatoken delicious base seasoning prior to cooking periodtoken the smoked jalapenos are spicy hot and tasty periodtoken  the not so good online ordering for carryout on their website is odd commatoken they list menu items with no price commatoken details and you cant click on them to select periodtoken so they state for you call a central number to order for multiple locations periodtoken 10 min later called by location to tell me the dessert i ordered isnt available there periodtoken  was told order was ready commatoken arrived shortly commatoken saw my sack sitting there and quite a while before anyone acknowledged me periodtoken then i had to wait too for her to get a manager to remove the desert they didnt offer periodtoken  was given no choice of bbq sauce and they have 3 kinds periodtoken  did not care at all for what they gave me commatoken the signature sauce periodtoken  collard greens lacked depth of flavor commatoken mac  cheese was just ok periodtoken  it takes away from the quality of the brisket to not enjoy the sauce commatoken ended up eating it plain periodtoken  overall commatoken id call it a frustrating dining experience commatoken but there is no doubt they got the brisket seasoning and cooking perfect periodtoken","9652":"pancakes pure and simple periodtoken is it really worth the wait on a monday morning was surprised to see the line periodtoken the pancakes are good commatoken but they are just pancakes periodtoken","9653":"though cooked within an inch of their lives commatoken the burgers were tasty periodtoken the bacon on mine was crisp and delicious commatoken but the cheese noted on the menu as american cheese was nasty fake cheez whiz periodtoken my companion ate all of his fries commatoken but i found mine soggy and greasy and barely ate half periodtoken companions black and white milkshake was so thick he had to eat it with a spoon periodtoken service was slow commatoken but i think they are still working out the bugs periodtoken the ordertakercashier seemed overwhelmed commatoken having to take both instore and phone orders periodtoken go on a nice day commatoken when you can sit outside commatoken as the tiny dining room gets quite cramped when a line forms for ordering periodtoken i will probably try again commatoken but order ahead for takeout periodtoken we were planning on their highly touted icecream for dessert commatoken but the line was ridiculously long periodtoken","9654":"weve been enjoying coffee at la colombe for many years commatoken but lately the baristas seem not to be trained properly periodtoken  in the past commatoken my latte would be crowned with a 12 to 34inch layer of thick commatoken creamy steamed milk foam periodtoken it would be so dense that i could run a spoon through it and it would leave a fairly deep trail periodtoken   but the last several times weve been there commatoken there has been almost no foam  what foam there was consisted of a 116th to 18thinch layer  and it was thin not only in depth but also density periodtoken i can make coffee with hot milk at home i dont go to la colombe for cafe au lait periodtoken  this has been extremely disappointing   perhaps they are spending all of their energy elsewhere commatoken like the tv show commatoken or the newly opened shops periodtoken hope someone in management wakes up and trains their baristas better commatoken or we will have to find another place to get our coffee fix periodtoken","9655":"the food and the atmosphere here is great but not good enough for the poor service periodtoken  be prepared to be here for awhile if you are coming to eat periodtoken  the waitress did not ask for a drink order and every time we needed something we had to track her down periodtoken    i am not a fan of a traditional mexican restaurant where there is not hot sauce or salsa on the table commatoken you have to ask for it and they charge you a 1 periodtoken","9656":"i always have to be literal when i dont care for a place periodtoken sadly commatoken this hooters was a disappointment periodtoken they felt quite sterile and not a place to make your regular haunt periodtoken beer is always a safe bet so points go there periodtoken food tasted very preprepared and had chewy texture wings periodtoken i used to go to the one off tanque verde in the 90s and it was great then periodtoken if i were to offer advice to this franchise outlet it would be to go back to local sourcing periodtoken other bars and restaurants are doing just that and they are amazing periodtoken","9657":"based on 4 bowls of the pho tai commatoken we were not impressed periodtoken  the broth was ok commatoken not as layered and flavorful as im used to periodtoken    the side plates with lime were good except for the lime on two plates the end pieces with less juice than needed commatoken and the bitter liquid from the rind squeezed out too periodtoken  but most disappointing was the rare steak periodtoken  it was very tough and chewy commatoken not pleasant to eat periodtoken two of our party left most of it in their bowls periodtoken  one of our party kept casually listing all the pho places she knows that are better commatoken not intentionally slandering this place commatoken but saying what she preferred about other places commatoken which turned out to be everything periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  except the egg rolls commatoken which she liked a lot periodtoken  the thai tea was good periodtoken   best about the experience was the service periodtoken all of the girls working there were great commatoken kind and helpful periodtoken  im not going to have the pho again commatoken but will likely come back to try the banh mi periodtoken","9658":"should be 2 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken the menu sounds amazing commatoken but this places is hot as ballz and i dont mean in a cool way periodtoken you will sweat your ass off upstairs the food was decent commatoken but too many flavors made the taste overwhelming periodtoken fries are good commatoken but you will pay 2 bucks for each small jar of ketchup periodtoken so pay attention periodtoken ive eaten gluten free for 3 12 years and these were prob the worst buns periodtoken super dry interesting experience with hipster vibe commatoken but ill prob never come back periodtoken","9659":"save on foods commatoken my formerly favorite food store has completely redone their website periodtoken i think that the purpose of this is to conceal the fact that they have drastically raised their prices while drastically reducing the value of their loyalty points periodtoken after almost 30 years commatoken ill be saying goodbye to their great pharmacy and their wonderful employees periodtoken i just cant afford them anymore periodtoken","9660":"i really really wanted to like this place after the good reviews triggered all my childhood memories of eating raw cooking dough and hoping i didnt get sick from the eggs lol periodtoken  the location was a pain to find via my gps commatoken but once i found it the place is very cute periodtoken  the service was very friendly and the prices werent bad commatoken but the dough was disappointing periodtoken  some of the flavors were blander than i expected and the texture was just weird periodtoken  kind of gritty and not the creamy melt in your mouth feel that i craved periodtoken  maybe itd be better topped with ice cream or actually baked commatoken but i doubt ill give this place another try periodtoken","9661":"as a boba milk tea addict from houston commatoken i always go out of my way on my vacations to try out the boba tea joints in different cities periodtoken and sadly commatoken i was pretty disappointed by bings periodtoken sure commatoken i dont expect a city like tucson to have amazing bubble tea commatoken but their milk tea was super bland commatoken unsweetened though i ordered sweetened commatoken and extremely watered down periodtoken their tapioca was average in consistency and their prices are decent periodtoken my friends ordered the taro snow too sweet and the peachapricot herbal tea also watered down periodtoken unless a more authentic place opens up commatoken im afraid that tucson will never know how amazing boba milk tea truly is periodtoken","9662":"good location on the santa barbara pier periodtoken  being the shellfish company commatoken i was expecting pretty good food commatoken which i cannot say i found periodtoken  we got fried calamari and something else commatoken oysters rockefeller periodtoken  neither was too impressive periodtoken  dont plan on returning periodtoken","9663":"ive only been to whirled peace once commatoken and while the frozen yogurt i had was not bad per say they were out of about half of flavors so the selection was very limited periodtoken i would say that kiwi or sweet frog is better commatoken but i also didnt get a flavor i would usually choose so it would be unfair to make that judgement periodtoken it was right after the bike race commatoken so that may explain the lack of selection periodtoken the service was good and the employees were friendly periodtoken i will definitely be giving them another try and hopefully they will be better stocked periodtoken","9664":"we checked out poblanos this evening periodtoken  i cant say we were very impressed periodtoken  im a huge mexican food lover commatoken but it seems like this place fell short periodtoken  while waiting for our dinners to come commatoken i snacked on the chips  salsa periodtoken  the chips were actually a bit stale  slightly damp periodtoken  the salsa tasted good though periodtoken  it had a strong cumin  tomato sauce base periodtoken  there wasnt much chili pepper flavor to it commatoken but still it was decent periodtoken  my dinner consisted of chicken enchiladas periodtoken  the chicken was very rubbery periodtoken  im not sure what causes that commatoken but i had the sense i was eating old chicken periodtoken  the sauce on the enchiladas was totally boring periodtoken  overall i was disappointed periodtoken","9665":"this place is pretty expensive periodtoken  i do not mind expensive periodtoken  i frequent expensive places periodtoken  i like quality too periodtoken    this place is not quality periodtoken  ive been here a couple times before writing a review because too many people whose opinions said great things about it periodtoken  fuck that noise periodtoken    ive found cocktails to be inconsistent each time i was there periodtoken        the bartenders do not know how to make a good drink more complicated than 1 mixer and 1 liquor periodtoken    im not a fan of the starters either periodtoken  ive never had a full meal here based on the starters periodtoken  first off commatoken theyre all pretty rich and decadent periodtoken  sounds good commatoken yeah every time i tried theyve been over salted and if its hot commatoken a bit burned periodtoken   its just another place for people in the neighborhood to show people how awesome they are periodtoken    the older douche crowd periodtoken","9666":"i am actually giving this a 2 periodtoken5 but that doesnt exist periodtoken i tried this place because wood pizza was closed amazing place periodtoken the atmosphere is very nice periodtoken the inside looks like chipotle gone pizza crazy even the menu looks the same periodtoken i was impressed with the interior periodtoken the pizza selection is nice commatoken and the make your own pizza chipotle is a good option periodtoken however commatoken the first thing i noticed was that the crusts are premade periodtoken this is a big nono for me commatoken but i can understand doing this if it is necessary for the gluten free crusts not sure the process of making this periodtoken they were very accommodating and allowed me and my friends to do 4 different pizzas on two crusts half and half periodtoken we paid commatoken ordered some tap wine possibly a good idea commatoken depending on if youre looking to get smashed terrible idea if you are a wine snob periodtoken the wine was fine commatoken but the price was 6 for a tester cup of wine half a 9 oz plastic glass commatoken so 4 periodtoken5 oz periodtoken i normally hate people who complain and moan about prices just get out if you are going to complain about reasonable prices for good food commatoken but 6 for this glass of wine was just absurd periodtoken the wine was 1846 cabernet periodtoken i mean i still bought it commatoken but im not getting another glass periodtoken im just going to go next door to rouses and buy a whole bottle for 20 price of the wine served periodtoken a 16 oz beer local craft was the same price periodtoken so finally to the pizza periodtoken it was not good periodtoken as my friend first pointed out commatoken the chicken tasted frozen i agree commatoken the toppings were ordinary commatoken and there was wayyyy too much sauce in one of our pizzas and barely any on the other periodtoken definitely not the worst pizza ever commatoken but not worth going back periodtoken there is a growing trend in new orleans right now where restaurants think that if they look pretty commatoken they dont need to have good food periodtoken this restaurant fits in this category periodtoken shame shame commatoken new orleans periodtoken","9667":"as someone who loves mexican commatoken and knows how hard it is to find it in delco commatoken i had high hopes for sweet taco but was sadly disappointed periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the staff is friendly commatoken the atmosphere is nice commatoken and they have a bar but the good stops there periodtoken  their menu is very short commatoken and you cant even get a chicken burrito periodtoken  i got the roasted chicken tacos commatoken they had no taste who doesnt put cheese on a taco i had to douse it in their lime hot sauce to have any flavor periodtoken    maybe id come back if i was looking for just simple chipsdip and a beer commatoken but otherwise will keep up the search for good delco mexican","9668":"i usually go to petra express in new tampa but thought i would try this place since i was in the neighborhood periodtoken i thought the food at petra express was much better crispy fries  moist chicken periodtoken the

great locationi live down the street in that it is right off of 275 commatoken and a pretty good beer selection that is constantly changing commatoken run parallel to rude servers that feel the need to look down on peoplemyself and another i saw and pretty basic bar grub periodtoken  i get that it is a spot for the cool kids commatoken  but maybe bringing it down a notch will help commatoken or

wont go back periodtoken","9673":"this westshore pizza is kind of like a high school class with a substitute teacher periodtoken it seems like its just a bunch of teenagers running the place with little to no management periodtoken one time i placed a pickup order and they lost my pizza periodtoken after waiting forever to get the pizza commatoken they started looking around and questioning each other commatoken and no one knew where the pizza went periodtoken delivery guy didnt take it but the cook said he made it periodtoken got my money back and went elsewhere periodtoken   i cant order online because my zip isnt listed on the website even though they deliver here periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   when i call for delivery and the person on the phone is answering 2 or 3 calls while theyre talking to me periodtoken then i have to repeat everything i said because they were answering another line periodtoken   the food is decent when you get it commatoken but it usually

i was about halfway through my dish commatoken the waitress came and offered desert periodtoken without even a chance to respond commatoken drop check commatoken and raced off periodtoken we were the

periodtoken the food was fair to good commatoken not great periodtoken id say olive garden would edge them out on food quality and appearance periodtoken but commatoken not by much  we eat out a lot

pie and we both are antiprovel cheese periodtoken went to pick it up right around the time they said itd be ready commatoken and it wasnt periodtoken no big deal periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenabout the wait commatoken at least periodtoken i dont know if its because they were rushing to get the order to me or whatever commatoken but when i got the pizza home commatoken it was a big soupy mess periodtoken nearly all of the cheese slipped off of each slice as we pulled them out and took the sauce with it periodtoken the crust was soggy and we had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork because it was too limp to pick up and eat periodtoken   the flavor profile itself was okay periodtoken not great periodtoken not even particularly good periodtoken but passable periodtoken except it was well below the quality id expect for the price periodtoken a 14 thick crust with 2 12 toppings and a crappy salad was nearly 30 periodtoken   speaking of the salad commatoken it was subpar even by pizza joint standards periodtoken limp commatoken white lettuce topped with a few tomato slices commatoken a good smattering of onions commatoken and a whole mess of cheese periodtoken the house dressing was fine commatoken but the blue cheese we ordered on the side was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenprobably not blue cheese commatoken but not sure what it was periodtoken it was a pale pink dressing that looked like it couldve been a vinaigrette commatoken except that it was gelatinous periodtoken not thick like a blue cheese or ranch periodtoken but like almostsolid jello periodtoken the onions were fresh and crisp commatoken though periodtoken  i gave bonos 2 stars out of 5 periodtoken thats a tad generous periodtoken its more like a 310 periodtoken its certainly not the worst pizza ive ever had from a legit pizza place meaning a place that should be above pizza hut and papa johns level pizza commatoken but it might be in my bottom 10 periodtoken   bottom line we will not be back periodtoken id rather spend 10 on little caesars than 28 on bonos periodtoken","9677":"just an ok place commatoken typical soso food commatoken nothing to write home about periodtoken  i ordered omlette fleur de lis periodtoken other than a handful of tiny crawfish tails commatoken it is not that different from a regular cheese omlette for any diner in nj periodtoken same could be said of potato commatoken and coffee periodtoken not really worth the price tag periodtoken   service is slow commatoken the waitress was busy chatting with another customer that i had to remind her that my food was ready and getting cold at the counter periodtoken","9678":"i normally go to starbucks every morning before work commatoken there is always a nice gentleman and an older lady with beautiful snowy hair there to make my beverage periodtoken periodtoken so normally i make an online order in advance simply because im normally in a rush periodtoken periodtoken this one day i decided id go in earlier simply because i was already out periodtoken periodtoken well the two people who normally served me werent there so there was this other heavier set girl with brunette hair there periodtoken she questioned me when i was just waiting 2 minutes earlier periodtoken periodtoken i told her that i had made an online order but there was no rush and she goes well its not even that time yet so why are you even here with a nasty attitude which i didnt appreciate periodtoken i told her i go there every morning with the same order commatoken she shouldnt have had an attitude for me

place because its a cool new brewery commatoken and why not   i was really excited to try their different beers commatoken only to find that they were out of many of  them commatoken which means they didnt plan well enough to keep themselves stocked periodtoken   the food was mediocre commatoken and that is based on trying the two sausage plate commatoken pork belly tacos commatoken and poutine periodtoken the poutine was great commatoken in my opinion but the main dishes were lacklustre periodtoken i wished more of the beers were available commatoken though i am a big fan of their saison commatoken the rest of the beers offered were just okay periodtoken american pale ale and american sour wheat periodtoken   also commatoken the server was slow to respond commatoken we had to keep reminding them of what we ordered commatoken and it was just not a great experience periodtoken ive experienced better periodtoken  on the pro side commatoken the place looked amazing commatoken i loved the modern decor commatoken they kept some of the original building features in tact like a bank vault in the mens bathroom commatoken and the lighting and ambiance was superb periodtoken   i think this is a great place to come back and have a beer and a few appetizers commatoken and not so great a place to come to eat and be waited on periodtoken","9680":"whole foods markets are very similar commatoken so you are probably not reading this review to see how good the supermarket is periodtoken this store is new commatoken so it has all the bells and whistles periodtoken but the reason why it well deserves a negative review is that the company badly miscalculated parking periodtoken if you come in offhours commatoken no problem periodtoken but at prime time commatoken parking is here is horrendous periodtoken it is a total zoo and you can easily leave without a parking place periodtoken to my mind commatoken for a new store commatoken that is an unpardonable sin

commatoken not the cleanest place ive ever brunched periodtoken  i ordered coffee and eggs benedict with hash browns periodtoken  the coffee was typical diner coffee commatoken watery but okay the hash browns were good but super salty and this is coming from a girl that loves a well salted meal and the eggs benedict caused me the most inner conflict periodtoken periodtoken  the eggs were poached perfectly but a little on the wet side commatoken the hollandaise sauce was done quite well but the biscuit in place of the english muffin throws off the texture commatoken and to add insult to injury commatoken the ham they used was the super thin sliced lunch meat style ham commatoken which was disappointing periodtoken","9683":"the bad ive been here 4 times but only ate here once because the place is never open at 11am like they advertise periodtoken this is very unprofessional which is why they lost 3 stars periodtoken open when you say you are open or change your hours

periodtoken  i just think that they are a bit overrated periodtoken  when i was there yesterday commatoken they only had 3 types of bagels commatoken the tables were dirty and there were no napkins periodtoken  yes commatoken this was a bit after lunch commatoken but if youre a bagel place commatoken come on  i ordered a nontoasted bagel and cream cheese for there and got a dark toasted extra toasted bagel and cream cheese periodtoken  when i said they needed to make me a new one commatoken two out of three people behind the counter argued over who was right abut the order periodtoken  i told them to argue later and just make the bagel periodtoken  i pretty much got it tossed at my head a minute later periodtoken  oh well periodtoken  if you go there commatoken please take notice of the menu board periodtoken  half of it is marked out with white masking tape periodtoken  thats pretty cheesy no pun intended periodtoken  they make a mint from the jenkintown community commatoken so

kick lately periodtoken  its advertised as having mixed greens although my bowl only had spinach which im not always crazy about as the lone salad green periodtoken  the other toppings were a bit sparse periodtoken  for 7 periodtoken49 which i personally think is expensive for a salad i expected more periodtoken  i did not order the soup commatoken but i passed by the bowls on my way to pick up my salad and they did not look appetizing periodtoken  if you have your food out where customers can see it you need to work on presentation periodtoken  otherwise it was clean and the staff was friendly periodtoken  i still think ill spend my money elsewhere periodtoken","9688":"ive decided to update my review of this place periodtoken it has to be the place to go according to legend and the best place to stand in line half the day waiting and looking at other fools who are staring at you periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenbecause everyone had the idea because they read something legendary about this place periodtoken please commatoken do tip well and enjoy the coffee and syrup buzz without even considering the idea that most people have eaten breakfast and are having their third beer by the time you drop your sausage as a result having the fasting shakes","9689":"the atmosphere was pretty boring periodtoken no music was playing commatoken so it was nice that you could actually have a conversation periodtoken it took about 15 min to get our drinks and only spoke to the waitress twice periodtoken   it was neat that the drinks were served in beakers and science glass

second time from wrong oder i got for take out periodtoken then after going back to fix order the 4th count chicken strips i got is barely 4 not sure whats going on there but definitely not pleased today","9708":"through the end of the week commatoken las cazuelas is offering up any item from their menu for 7 between 11am3pm periodtoken thats a pretty sweet deal periodtoken dan and i stopped in here on a lunch break from work periodtoken we picked up a few beers from the foodery and stopped by periodtoken  the spot is tiny commatoken but nice periodtoken there are about ten tables across the dining area with a small commatoken open kitchen periodtoken the walls are brightly painted commatoken and there are several other endearing decorations periodtoken i dont usually go crazy over atmosphere commatoken and one shouldnt expect anything from a place on 5th and girard commatoken but the decor is well done periodtoken  i dont want to make a blanket statement about the service but here are two of my observations las cazuelas and the abbaye share some staff commatoken to my chagrin periodtoken second commatoken my first choice on the menu wasnt available the last two were served moments before periodtoken im not a restaurant manager commatoken but running out of a dish before lunch let alone dinner is finished seems to be problematic periodtoken one plus are the free chips and salsa verde as soon as you sit down periodtoken  the food came out quickly periodtoken i ended up with a dish with rice and panseared shrimp commatoken along with caramelized mixed veggies periodtoken everything was acceptable commatoken but i cant rave about anything periodtoken the portions could have been a bit bigger periodtoken dan went with marinated beef tips commatoken with refried beans and avocado periodtoken he said that the meat wasnt the best cut commatoken and it marinade could have been improved upon periodtoken neither of us could remark about anything other that the fact that we were getting a good deal for the money periodtoken  for our drinks commatoken we picked up rouges chili ale commatoken which had a great pepper taste that didnt overpower periodtoken it was a great way to start our meal periodtoken we had the hot rock lager from port brewing to finish commatoken which was a solid commatoken but not outstanding commatoken lager periodtoken  bottom line id prefer not to bash a place that is offering such a great deal periodtoken i like the initiative to get in new customers periodtoken but with a plethora of good mexican spots commatoken one of my favorites only a few blocks a way commatoken i cant see myself ever going back here periodtoken","9709":"note this review is for lunch only periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  if you look up meh periodtoken ive experienced better in the dictionary commatoken you would find the fountain on locust periodtoken this place is not bad commatoken but there are dozens of places in the area where i would rather eat periodtoken  i want to love this place and i do enjoy their desserts periodtoken ive been here 4 times commatoken always with family members who love it periodtoken but as a recovering vegetarian commatoken i rarely find anything appealing on their lunch menu periodtoken their egg salad sandwich is loaded with mayo periodtoken their cheese sandwich is kind of soggy periodtoken and their birdseed salad is super sweet periodtoken i had to ask for dijon mustard to cut the sugar in the dressing periodtoken  each time ive been seated commatoken they have to ask if were ordering lunch periodtoken the assumption commatoken however commatoken is that we are there for desserts periodtoken this signals to me that real food is not their priority periodtoken and from the reviews commatoken its obvious that their draw is dessert periodtoken  after my last experience with just meh food commatoken i no longer accompany my aunts here for lunch periodtoken","9710":"its mcdonalds periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe staff was friendly and the order was correct commatoken thats about all you could review at mcds periodtoken note this is in a part of town where low lifes hang out during the day so expect some panhandeling dirtbag to hit you up for some change periodtoken","9711":"this is not for the grocery selection commatoken this is for the delisalad bar pre made selections periodtoken conceptually this place is heaven for me commatoken lots of healthy options in a quick commatoken self serve buffet periodtoken yeah not so much commatoken quantity doesnt mean quality periodtoken the buffet food is never fresh commatoken pasta and rice is often crispy from sitting out too long and anything in a sauce has a film over it periodtoken their paninis take 5 minutes on the grill and then when they come out the inside is still completely cold periodtoken the salad bar is ok but 13 for a salad off a buffet i can sit down somewhere and get a fresh made to order salad served to me for less the community lunch tables in the back of the store are often dirty and not cleaned up after patrons finish their lunch periodtoken ive eaten here for lunch 1015 times now out of pure convenience just hoping ill find something worth while but no such luck periodtoken","9712":"pretty disappointing experience periodtoken i wanted an after dinner treat for the family commatoken but was left wanting periodtoken  first the concept is do it yourself commatoken frozen yogurt sundaes periodtoken you put in what you want and pay by weight periodtoken so instead of getting what you pay for and then complaining about variations in that you pay for what you get periodtoken so ok im with you so far periodtoken   there were several yogurt choices commatoken from the standard vanilla and chocolate to red velvet which colors childrens lips like lipstick pineapple and coffee periodtoken choices for everyone commatoken so again commatoken im with you periodtoken but then the wheels came off periodtoken  one commatoken the bowls are trough size periodtoken so while frozen yogurt might be healthier than ice cream commatoken not in that quantity it isnt and there was no kid size commatoken so while my best choice would have been to insist that the kids shared commatoken or shared with me commatoken i did not want to fight that battle tonight periodtoken so thats on me periodtoken but kid size would be nice periodtoken  two commatoken the toppings were poorly labeled and many including all the fruit options empty periodtoken so while you can kind of tell what things are commatoken some of the spoons were labeled commatoken some were not and some were in the wrong place periodtoken so this added a level of frustration when on tries to balance multiple feeding troughs of frozen yogurt and keep the childrens hands out of the candy pieces commatoken while ensuring that they cover their mouths and dont sneeze in the mms periodtoken   and then it was a good thing i wasnt with the health department periodtoken the tables were dirty commatoken toppings had been slopped around and yogurt drips were everywhere periodtoken we wiped our own table to get a place to sit periodtoken   the good news for me is that i dont live near here commatoken so im hoping for better results in btown commatoken but if you live near here be warned commatoken or at least lower your expectations periodtoken","9713":"this place sucks periodtoken i dont quite understand what all the hypes about periodtoken their coffee tastes like any other coffee and the employees treat you like shit periodtoken i wouldnt go back periodtoken","9714":"we came here after checking the great reviews on yelp commatoken however the place did not meet the expectation periodtoken the seafood did not taste fresh commatoken and the scallops i took had a totally bland taste periodtoken definitely not a good ratio of qualoty per money periodtoken hope this is helpful periodtoken","9715":"i am born and raised in chicago periodtoken  i moved here two years ago and was very excited when they opened up the chicago staple commatoken harolds chicken periodtoken  i have been here several times with the last time being the worst periodtoken  we stood there waiting on someone to take our order periodtoken  no one greeted us or asked if they could take our order periodtoken  he just looked at us periodtoken  my husband ordered a perch dinner with salt commatoken pepper and mild sauce its a chicago thing periodtoken  we had to clean our own table with wet napkins in order to dinein periodtoken when he got his food commatoken they were the smallest two pieces of fish i had ever seen  for ten bucks commatoken i expected a little more commatoken especially since this was not the first time weve ordered the perch dinner periodtoken    im just really disappointed that they could not keep up the service and food they presented when they first opened periodtoken","9716":"i attended a wedding here on a friday evening in the courtyard periodtoken  there were candles placed around the gorgeous fountain and the setting was quite beautiful periodtoken  yet commatoken the fountain was not running periodtoken  why  i can only assume because when they did turn it on close to the beginning of the ceremony commatoken it was leaking and the ground got wet periodtoken  the reception followed in a banquet room tucked away behind several odd turns and at the end of an extensive hall periodtoken  the room itself was long and and narrow and did not accommodate seating for the number of guests in attendance periodtoken  i attribute this to poor planning on the hotels part periodtoken  the worst part was that the food was not ready when the reception began even though the ceremony was 45 minutes late getting started periodtoken  my guest and i were starving and had no place to sit periodtoken  we left and went to a restaurant across the street to eat periodtoken","9717":"love the chipotle chain but this one has variable quality on the food periodtoken  i mostly get the bowls and chicken always comes out great periodtoken  steak is spotty commatoken tonights was very chewy commatoken ended up giving three pieces to my dog periodtoken  place is always busy commatoken definitely recommend online order and pick up periodtoken","9718":"unimpressed we went here based on the reviews but were very disappointed periodtoken  its not really a restaurant commatoken more of a walk in shack periodtoken there are only bar stools to sit on inside and its cramped periodtoken you can sit outside commatoken which is nice but not what was expected periodtoken  i had the coconut shrimp and they were just o periodtokenk periodtoken the shrimp had an odd metallic taste to them and the coleslaw was underwhelming periodtoken my husband ordered the crab sandwich and it was completely bland periodtoken we added some salt and it was better but still pretty flat periodtoken the crab was all ground up and unrecognizable commatoken you would think a place touting fresh commatoken local seafood would use lump crab periodtoken we both tried the chowder but it was thin and too salty periodtoken a real bummer since we both love chowder normally periodtoken  it was a 50 lunch and we didnt enjoy anything we had so it was a real let down periodtoken ","9719":"while beef obradys is usually just a little short of horrifying commatoken this particular one isnt quite that bad periodtoken sure commatoken the service sucks and ok commatoken there are minimullet sporting guys drinking tap beer at noon on a weekday periodtoken periodtoken but the buffalo chicken wrap is not only edible commatoken but decent periodtoken\r \r its pretty lame how they charge for every single little thing periodtoken periodtoken if you get wings they will charge extra for celery commatoken blue cheese and ranch periodtoken periodtoken each periodtoken its not much commatoken but seems petty periodtoken","9720":"i ordered a green tea latte periodtoken it was only lukewarm when served periodtoken we also had bagels with flavored cream cheese and the flavoring was so subtle we couldnt tell which was chive and which was jalape\u00f1o periodtoken i wasnt thrilled and my husband said his iced latte was extremely weak periodtoken","9721":"let me first say  i love urban juicer periodtoken this review is simply due to the service at this location periodtoken after a fun weekend of not grocery shopping commatoken monday morning i needed a quick coffee and smoothie to start my day periodtoken i was the only one here around 740 am and ordered a smoothie and a cold brew with almond milk periodtoken the person making my smoothie  was talking to their colleague and going extremely slow periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenlike multiple pauses in adding stuff to the blender so they could finish their sentences periodtoken if it was on a weekend day commatoken fine commatoken i wouldnt care periodtoken being on a monday morning when its pretty clear im trying to go to work it was extremely irritating periodtoken to add to the irritation commatoken when i finally get my smoothie i have to ask for a cup and almond milk to pour the coffee in periodtoken usually when i visit uj in the arcade commatoken they are on their game and its ready in a whiz periodtoken to add to this unpleasant experience commatoken when i am finally at work commatoken sitting at my desk commatoken sipping my not very well made smoothie commatoken i spot a hair at the bottom periodtoken perfect periodtoken i will probably not go back to this location and stick to the arcade as the arcade is clearly trained to handle people on the way to work and ive never seen a hair in anything ive ordered ","9722":"very average at best periodtoken  we didnt try the wings which i think is their speciality but what we did try was nothing to write home about periodtoken  we started with an order of ultimate fries which were described as being jumbo basket of fries smothered with 3 kinds of cheese commatoken cajun seasoning and topped with crispy bacon commatoken served with sour cream periodtoken  the fries were crinkle cut and were barely fried  they could have stood a few more minutes to make them crispy and not soggy periodtoken  the three kinds of cheese turned out to be massive amounts of canned cheese sauce which i didnt know was a kind of cheese and a little of a mixed cheese blend sprinkled on top periodtoken  the cajun seasoning was missing  no site of it and no taste of it periodtoken  then we ordered a burger which they claimed to be the best burger in brentwood periodtoken  well commatoken there arent many burger joints in brentwood so thats not a huge claim periodtoken  but i am not sure of any place in brentwood that doesnt make a better burger than this one except a couple of the fast food drive throughs and at least one of those makes a better burger periodtoken  it was edible periodtoken  it was food periodtoken  it wasnt very busy for a friday night at 7pm periodtoken  but that is about all i can give it periodtoken","9723":"the portions were smaller than normal periodtoken some management issues today periodtoken got dirty silverware twice periodtoken decided to wipe it down myself instead of asking for clean silver ware a third time periodtoken the food itself was disappointing periodtoken the sides were cold or bland or both periodtoken my friends chicken dumplings were bland and mushy periodtoken overall poor dining experience periodtoken shape up","9724":"ive stopped by twice during lunch hour and they have had only one register open periodtoken this is not fast food commatoken its slow food periodtoken also today they had big red posters and signs up for specialty coffee and teas but when the person behind me tried to order one they were told oh no commatoken we dont have any of that periodtoken this is the closest fast food to my job but ill be glad to drive a little further for quicker service periodtoken","9725":"still lagging in terms of delivery and service  commatoken the food is good if you eat in only periodtoken","9726":"meh periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken maybe im asian commatoken so i dont quite get the fusionized taste commatoken but their sandwiches and teas failed to impress me periodtoken also commatoken the staff wasnt particularly warm and i didnt feel at ease the entire time i was there periodtoken the prices are steep for what they offer periodtoken id prefer chinatown over this anyday periodtoken  as a study place commatoken it is nice commatoken if you get a spot with an outlet periodtoken and commatoken like someone mentioned previously commatoken the music sucks and i have to turn up the volume on my own headphones to concentrate periodtoken","9727":"they didnt have several types of bread available periodtoken im stuck without food while my brother and fianc\u00e9 are eating periodtoken she said i could wait 10 minutes but i would rather just eat at home instead of paying for food and not having time to eat with the people i came with periodtoken the floors and the tables are disgusting commatoken temperature is too hot commatoken and theres only the one employee periodtoken just not a great place compared to all of the other subways ive been to periodtoken","9728":"this used to be my regular lunch spot until i got fed up with the turkey and brie sandwiches periodtoken the honey mustard is carelessly distributed on the flatbread so the sandwich is very dry and tasteless periodtoken","9729":"we had a very disappointing meal here  the hummus was flavorless and overly thick periodtoken the lemon soup was overpowered with lemon flavor periodtoken gyro meat was dry commatoken and the pita bread is not homemade periodtoken finally the tabouleh was made of large pieces of tomato and cucumber periodtoken it was lazy preparation periodtoken lastly commatoken the meal is far from moderately priced periodtoken","9730":"il posto is a very interesting concept commatoken simple commatoken fresh good food in a nice space periodtoken  the food was tasty commatoken we had a tuna salad and a hero panini periodtoken everything was fresh and good periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the service is horrible periodtoken  no hello when you walk through the door periodtoken the gentleman who works the counter has an odd holier than thou attitude periodtoken  they need at least one serverfood runner periodtoken  the guy running the show has such a strange attitude that i doubt i will ever go back again periodtoken  the owner commatoken who is also the chef commatoken was pleasant enough commatoken and they were pretty busy periodtoken  i cant stress enough how rude and unhelpful the guy at the counter was periodtoken  get over yourself commatoken brah periodtoken a shame that the food was great commatoken because ill never go back periodtoken","9731":"pretty decent commatoken always has been clean and orderly periodtoken found the specific bk to be quite noisy amongst employees very loud and boisterous stick to the drive thru commatoken although employees can be seen dancing and being very loud there too commatoken one wordurban","9732":"the concept is awesome periodtoken  the energy is very much alive periodtoken  the market does fit well with the area periodtoken  the issues  the prices are way out of whack for the amount of product commatoken quality and over all presentation periodtoken  its like an airport commatoken they have a captive audience commatoken no other options close by commatoken so they gouge you on price periodtoken  the only difference commatoken there are a lot of places to buy natural food in a fun atmosphere at much lower costs periodtoken  well continue to walk around commatoken socialize commatoken but werere not buying until prices are equalized periodtoken","9733":"drinks are decent commatoken but expensive periodtoken not many outlets to plug in phonetabletlaptop chargers periodtoken also commatoken they always have the air conditioning on full blast in there periodtoken its way too cold periodtoken i cant stay there longer than a few minutes unless i have a jacket on periodtoken","9734":"i heard so many great things about this place and really was optimistic commatoken but was seriously disappointed periodtoken i went during restaurant week and did the 3 course meal and it was just ok periodtoken not worth the 30 bucks they were charging periodtoken some under cooked phillo dough mushroom wrap and mediocre trout periodtoken the service could have also been better periodtoken not really diggin on overpriced food periodtoken","9735":"place is very over priced  staff doesnt seem very friendly everytime ive come in periodtoken i have gone to the brooksville location and they seemed much nicer periodtoken if youre looking for local raw honey check out murphys market way more local and affordable periodtoken","9736":"followed great recommendations and went for light lunch periodtoken  thirty minutes for minestrone seems a little long commatoken but when the only relevant comparison is to campbells one wonders about the recommendations commatoken only saved by adding the pesto they served with the bread periodtoken  perhaps a bad day commatoken everything else was fine if even if not remarkable periodtoken","9737":"went to blackberry again for lunch today and noticed that the cleanliness level definitely was not where it should be periodtoken  also commatoken they were out of one salad commatoken but none of the others  confusing commatoken how can you be out of one salad but not others  i mean they all have essentially the same ingredients periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken and service was extra slow commatoken and it was not that crowded periodtoken  hopefully just an off day periodtoken","9738":"the bourse is a beautiful building inside and outside periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  but commatoken its just a glorified food court periodtoken periodtoken  nothing local periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken its all mall chain restaurants periodtoken  none are very good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  youre not missing much if you skip the bourse periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9739":"this place is nice commatoken but certainly not worth all the fuss periodtoken they use lavazza coffee commatoken which makes cafe bustelo look gourmet commatoken especially they way they brew it here periodtoken the latte flavors commatoken including that used for the lavender latte commatoken is just monin syrup periodtoken the chai latte is boxed tazo chai concentrate poured into a cup with some mediocre italian coffee for 4 periodtoken it was meh periodtoken   i sampled the torrone gelato periodtoken it was creamy but too soft commatoken and the sweet flavor was lackluster periodtoken    if youre in dunedin and youre desperate for coffee commatoken go somewhere else periodtoken if youre in dunedin and desperate for a frozen treat then please go to strachans next door because that is some of the most fabulous frozenness i have ever had periodtoken   i give this place two stars instead of one because 1 the service was great and 2 the place is immaculate periodtoken so good job there commatoken frost  bean periodtoken until then commatoken step up your selection and lower your prices periodtoken","9740":"i havent gone here in about 6 months commatoken but ive been coming here since they opened periodtoken we ordered some takeout today and noticed things have changed periodtoken the prices have risen commatoken the portion sizes have dramatically decreased containers of steamed rice and beef with broccoli were only two thirds full commatoken and the food quality has also declined periodtoken we will no longer be eating here because of this periodtoken","9741":"i had probably the best sandwich ever here commatoken but the customer service leaves something to be desired periodtoken the two gentlemen behind the counter were accommodating and courteous but the lady at the register was crude commatoken offensive commatoken and beyond unprofessional periodtoken when there was a mixup over our order commatoken she stomped outside and yelled im gonna punch this bitch commatoken and other expletives to the customers dining outside periodtoken for that reason alone commatoken i will never dine here again unless the management seriously reconsiders the individuals representing their brand periodtoken","9742":"went over to subway last evening their were 2 employees in the store the guy was just standing their ehile the female waz doing all tbe work i went to the restroom 2 people in line same issue i left the store","9743":"tried to get here the weekend it opened but the lines were very long periodtoken second weekend commatoken no lines periodtoken  brought my daughter to grab a chili dog and fries periodtoken she liked the chili dog commatoken i did not commatoken but for 3 you cant expect much periodtoken maybe avoid the chili periodtoken  maybe avoid the cheese as well periodtoken the cheese was something resembling cheese whiz but more gelatinous and transparent periodtoken  the fries while abundant were soggy and tasteless periodtoken the gelatin based cheese did not help the fries periodtoken  i did like the lemonade though so there is that periodtoken  if you are in a hurry commatoken best to stay away as the 2 chili dogs commatoken fries and 2 drinks had me waiting 15 minutes with no lines periodtoken cost for all this happiness was 13 periodtoken again commatoken  you cant expect too much at that price periodtoken i will come back and try the ice cream as that portion of the menu seemed to be more popular than the food periodtoken","9744":"went this morning after hearing about it from friends periodtoken most of the donuts were dry and tasted like a dunkin donut that has been sitting on the counter for two days periodtoken the long johns tasted fresh and good but others were bad periodtoken waste of money periodtoken","9745":"horrible dont waste your time aside from there not being even average customer service tyemeka was talking commatoken no screaming into the phone as we were ordering commatoken the mac  cheese was old and flavorless commatoken the cabbage tasted as if sugar was added way too sweet and the greens and string beans tasted as if they were out of a can periodtoken rice was average and the meatloaf was just ok periodtoken definitely not worth the 24 periodtoken00 that we dropped periodtoken the 3 wings in the large platter was tasty after waiting 15 minutes for it periodtoken wow commatoken so disappointed while i tend to always patronize my own commatoken i will not return periodtoken","9746":"i know a lot of people like 5 guys commatoken but we were less than bowled over periodtoken for me commatoken i guess it boils down to not being a frequent red meat eater commatoken so i could definitely take it or leave it periodtoken lets just say that if im going to satisfy my onceamonth craving for a burger commatoken i probably wouldnt do it here periodtoken   we waited quite a while for our food commatoken though the restaurant didnt seem all that busy on our visit periodtoken perhaps they were just understaffed on that particular evening periodtoken all in all commatoken i thought the food was okay commatoken but the burgers were still a bit greasy and overladen with condiments and the fries were nothing to write home about as far as im concerned periodtoken im much rather have the fries complete with yummy dips at brugge brasserie periodtoken   in the end commatoken even my meat  potato loving better half was not impressed and that says a great deal right there  i didnt think hed ever met a burger he didnt love until we stopped in here periodtoken heres hoping this was just a fluke periodtoken","9747":"i so wanted this store to be good periodtoken one really nice thing is that the store is spacious periodtoken unlike the former vons store commatoken there are no cardboard stands of goods blocking the aisles periodtoken two carts can fit side by side in the aisles unfortunately commatoken it is expensive periodtoken yesterday i tried going again and several products had no prices namely commatoken the butter commatoken which i went in to buy periodtoken also commatoken last time id bought the haggen brand of ice cream commatoken only to discover later that the 4th ingredient on the list was corn syrup solids periodtoken the haggen brand of cinnamon rolls had corn syrup and corn syrup solids periodtoken i know sweet rolls and ice cream are hardly health food but why add corn syrup i ended up going to albertsons to buy the exact same items but for much less periodtoken alas periodtoken a pretty grocery store but much more expensive and not necessarilyy higher quality periodtoken","9748":"not overly impressed with this place considering they claim to have a legendary taste periodtoken the bread is good but i cant say much for the rest of the sandwich periodtoken i ordered a chicken cheesesteak and it was just chopped up chicken chunks with american cheese periodtoken very bland in the taste periodtoken they charge a little bit more than most local sandwich shops in the area so i guess i was expecting something a little bit more memorable periodtoken i wont be in a rush to return periodtoken","9749":"it is 7pm on a saturday night periodtoken  if you want a snack no pastry for u periodtoken   they are open two more hours and food case is completely empty and set for tomorrow periodtoken   just see two ladies working periodtoken  pleasant service but nothing above and beyond periodtoken    they proudly post their 100 on tn food visit periodtoken but store is not clean today periodtoken pastry glass filthy and the front door windows look like cleaned with a dirty cloth periodtoken   oh well the one up the street across the highway was a better experience","9750":"ive been wanting to try livery for a while commatoken and finally went last night with a bachelorette party periodtoken what a disappointment we had a reservation for 9 pm but our table wasnt ready periodtoken no big deal commatoken we headed to the bar and ordered drinks periodtoken our table opened up at 925 so we were good to go our server took our food orders first since we all still had drinks at that time periodtoken around 10 we didnt have any food yet commatoken and it started to rain so we quickly moved inside periodtoken they had a large table available that was able to fit all but 3 of us periodtoken so we just stood for about 15 mins until i finally asked our server if they intended to bring us chairs so we could sit when our food came periodtoken they brought us seats and we squeezed in at the table periodtoken at 1020 one of our guests asked the server for a drink refill  because in the 55 minutes she had been our server commatoken she never once asked if we wanted more drinks she took her order and started to walk away i waved her back and said commatoken i think our whole table would like to order drinks periodtoken our appetizers were finally served at 1025 periodtoken an hour after we had been seated periodtoken our drinks didnt come until 1040 periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken 20 mins after we ordered them periodtoken our dinner was not served until 1105 then those of us with skirt steak had the smallest little portions commatoken and it was drowning in oil and butter periodtoken we only had a few bites because it was so oily periodtoken so periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken bachelorette party periodtoken two hours for late night dinner service periodtoken server only got us one round of drinks more than an hour after we sat down periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken completely killed the mood of the party we had been at tastings beforehand and had the most amazing service commatoken incredible fun commatoken and livery brought the whole night down periodtoken we had 13 people to start periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken only 4 ended up continuing the party periodtoken the rest of us were sleepy and sober by then periodtoken we will not be back periodtoken","9751":"i was quite excited to try this new burger place commatoken as i have been known to enjoy a good burger commatoken so i decided to give it a try today late this afternoon periodtoken i ordered my food and found a place to sit down commatoken eventually periodtoken i was called for my food and went to the counter commatoken they handed me the bag and went back to what they were doing periodtoken i patiently waited and finally was able to acquire the soda which came with my order periodtoken i sat down and began trying out the food periodtoken      the first bight of my burger was amazing so i excitedly tried one of my fries much to my dismay tey had a very very funny taste to them commatoken as i had a few more i really began to have a bad taste in my mouth so i had a sip of my soda periodtoken i continued savoring my burger and quickly forgot about the fries commatoken no big loss in bad fries right so as i went to take a third sip from my soda i realized that although it felt heavy it was already void of any soda commatoken i peeked inside only to find it almost filled to the brim with ice periodtoken i went up to the counter and asked for a refill on the 2 soda commatoken i was told that it is their policy not to provide refills periodtoken      that was it after fries commatoken that are now making me feel quite ill commatoken and a soda that was filled to the brim with ice and would not be refilled i cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a meal periodtoken the only reason this place did not receive a single star is because their burger commatoken the signature mediumrare 500 degree burger commatoken was actually quite excellent periodtoken          if youre looking for just a burger give the place a try commatoken just dont expect smiling service periodtoken","9752":"i cant believe they havent remodeled this schnucks yet periodtoken  it looks horrible commatoken inside and out periodtoken  its just very out of date periodtoken  however commatoken its close to work and sometimes i have to run in for something periodtoken  their selection isnt as great as other stores around commatoken but it will do for the necessities periodtoken  still beats the brentwood dierbergs commatoken though commatoken which is outrageously expensive periodtoken","9753":"today was an unplanned trip periodtoken stopped in and got a few items to go periodtoken again it was messy periodtoken observed an employee cleaning tables periodtoken appeared to be working on speed not quality periodtoken many tables were not completely done periodtoken yes it was busy but thats not an excuse for a complete cleaning job periodtoken the food was meh periodtoken fries were all small bottom of the bag periodtokennot the normal long nice size periodtoken ive had so much better from this location periodtoken","9754":"i was so thrilled to be able to get a great gyros sandwich when kalamatas opened some years back

warm  not periodtoken i had heard that the owner is no longer on site and gone to another restaurant periodtoken fine commatoken except i think people currently in the kitchen may need more training periodtoken","9755":"i went here for the first time tonight after hearing good things from a friend and was decidedly underwhelmed periodtoken we happened to walk in at just the right time  after we ordered and sat down commatoken the line to order was out the door and stayed out the door for quite some time periodtoken   the menu is kind of skimpy commatoken but they did allow me to basically create my own burrito commatoken which i appreciated periodtoken   however periodtoken  we waited almost half an hour for two chicken burritos and two pork tacos periodtoken it was ridiculous periodtoken when we did receive our food commatoken i was unhappy to see that there was a serious lack of chicken in my chicken burrito and once i finished the burrito commatoken rice commatoken and beans commatoken i was still hungry periodtoken is this where the donuts come in the line was too long to even consider getting back in commatoken although the donut selection looked decent periodtoken for the price commatoken i wanted a little bit more substance periodtoken  next time ill just drive a little farther and go to chipotle periodtoken","9756":"server sat behind us chilling with her buddys while we could see our food sitting periodtoken said there was only one person cooking but i can see three people back there bull shit service periodtoken usually im not dissatisfied","9757":"went once commatoken  not sure i would go back periodtoken    i was hoping they really had some spectacular sushi after seeing the price of their buffet periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  i should have known better as after all it is buffet sushi periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken      the buffet is very clean and they do have a good variety of asian dishes commatoken but nothing is all that great periodtoken   you are better off going to a regular chinese buffet for half the price periodtoken","9758":"i loved this place when it first opened  i went back a few weeks ago and it was like a totally different place the waitress was rude commatoken we were the only ones in there right at lunch time which was this first clue something had changed and the food was not the same quality or price  the menu used to be simple but now it was a little larger periodtoken  it is really my petpeeve when places raise the prices but lower the quality of the food periodtoken  my friend ordered a tuna melt and it was very dry she said periodtoken  i ordered the quiche my favorite go to there which they were out of my first choice so i had to order one with meat instead periodtoken  it was not the same as it used to be at all  it was dry and just blahhh   the waitress told us there are new owners so i guess that explained all the changes periodtoken  if they want to survive commatoken i hope they change things for the better  i want small businesses to survive","9759":"all i wanted was a cup of coffee and i got that periodtoken it was friendly service periodtoken but the coffee was really bad and hence the two stars periodtoken","9760":"the place is situated picturesquely at the end of the wharf periodtoken friday at 230pm there was a 25 min wait to get a seat periodtoken  service was fine periodtoken the place has a cramped feel periodtoken the food was sort of disappointing periodtoken most people were ordering crab commatoken which is probably the best bed periodtoken i couldnt resist the raw oysters and uni periodtoken the oysters were good commatoken but no deal at 17 for a half dozen periodtoken the uni was fresh and served on top of fresh scallop slices and a ponzo type sauce periodtoken the sauce overpowered the uni sort of ruining it periodtoken the clam chowder was good periodtoken the lobster pasta that my dining companions shared was horrible periodtoken it tasted like some poorly made pasta with some dried up lobster scraps met a glass of cheap chardonnay periodtoken  not subtle nor simple commatoken just bad periodtoken maybe try the crab if you go not impressed periodtoken","9761":"food and drink are ordinary commatoken plus the attitude is very bad periodtoken looks very impatient periodtoken this place is owned by the restaurant next door commatoken wouldnt survive without it periodtoken not recommended","9762":"this restaurant is busy my boyfriend and i couldnt believe it periodtoken we went in to get some takeout food and it was a cluster f periodtoken it was so packed that they had people seated in the entry walkway periodtoken wow periodtoken you cant blame a restaurant for being busy although they should have just had a longer wait time instead of putting people in every nook and cranny periodtoken the service wasnt great periodtoken we waited over 20 mins to place a togo order and they never called when it was ready periodtoken after 40 mins my boyfriend ended up waking in commatoken seeing it commatoken and grabbing the order periodtoken we got home and we were ready for some bomb food periodtoken it was okay periodtoken nothing great periodtoken overall commatoken go to this restaurant if it is slow and expect average food periodtoken dont bother when it is busy periodtoken","9763":"found this restaurant on yelp and were looking forward to trying it periodtoken we must have been there on an off day as the food had zero flavor periodtoken three of us went and we all agreed commatoken there was no seasoning and the meat was very bland periodtoken we ordered the cuban commatoken the miami cuban commatoken and the roast pork sandwich periodtoken the bread and meat texture were good although my husband felt it was too soft but im not kidding commatoken absolutely no flavor periodtoken we asked for hot sauce and cuban sauce and added some salt to give it some sort of taste periodtoken","9764":"good service but horrible food periodtoken jacks new food truck series has to be the worst sandwiches i have ever eaten from jack in the box periodtoken taste ok but for 5 a sandwich commatoken better load it up periodtoken ive tried two out of the three and its horrible periodtoken the pork belly in the blt is so thin commatoken they should be illegal to classify it as belly periodtoken thick bacon is a better term and two pieces that cant fill the sandwich is a rip off periodtoken then the primerib steak sandwich didnt even fill 34 of the sandwich periodtoken once again failure periodtoken last but not least periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken they called the bread a baguette but its really just cheap sub bread periodtoken overall commatoken id be ashamed to even market these sandwich as such periodtoken i dont blame martha for not trying them periodtoken jackvsmartha","9765":"i really wanted to like west coast tacos periodtoken ive eaten with them twice and have been underwhelmed both times periodtoken its not that the food isnt good its just not as good as you hope it is periodtoken i get the whole korean bbq menu i just think a taco should be more than tortilla commatoken meat commatoken and an ounce of green onion periodtoken ill keep trying to find something i really like from these guys commatoken but only when its parked in a super convenient spot periodtoken","9766":"i was not happy with the food periodtoken everything was either really burn or under cooked periodtoken not worth going back","9767":"i eat at chateau cafe most work days and have decided the food depends on whose doing the cooking periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it has to be periodtoken one day commatoken ill have something great commatoken the next commatoken its terrible periodtoken i use to have chicken tenders every day until they change the breading on the tenders commatoken theyre terrible and gritty periodtoken today i had a fried shrimp caesar commatoken it was awful commatoken most of the romaine lettuce was limp and there was more yellowbrown lettuce than anything else periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the shrimp were under cooked periodtoken periodtoken my stomach is flipping just thinking about it periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i wont be eating there again periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9768":"i am so disappointed  after reading reviews for this place commatoken i was expecting so much  i ordered the beef brisket commatoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  you know how white turkey meat can look and smell delicious but you almost choke to death trying to get it down because it is so dry  that was the brisket they served me periodtoken  the portion was laughable  what is the one thing all southern bbq places have in common  ridiculously generous portions periodtoken  the portion i received would have been perfect on a kids menu periodtoken  the lowlight of the experience was the 8 stale potato chips they put on the platter periodtoken  the coleslaw earned them one extra star as it was very good periodtoken","9769":"i am giving the place 2 stars and i wanted to love it  i believe they will get better with time and i will update my review periodtoken  for now commatoken the food was fair commatoken but they also added oil on all sandwiches which were pre made and the price was too high for what you get periodtoken  the prepared juice was unremarkable periodtoken once again commatoken i will go back soon commatoken because the place is really nice and looks like a cool place to hang out periodtoken  i am hoping they will get better with time and become more competitive periodtoken","9770":"love the original tired hands location and i loved the fermentaria up until this point periodtoken  my husband and i were coming back from the city and wanted to stop and have a drink periodtoken  we saw they had a taco special up until 10 pm periodtoken  we arrived at approx periodtoken 940 pm and wanted to partake into this deal because the tacos are amazing  we seated ourselves and waited for the bar tender who was neglecting us periodtoken  it was a monday night there may have been 10 people in the whole place periodtoken  he finally came over at 958 pm to ask us for our drink order periodtoken  we asked if we can still get the taco deal periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenhe looked at his watch and said i guess and told the kitchen our order periodtoken  the kitchen is an open kitchen periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe chef basically flipped out for our order and was pissed periodtoken  a i get it commatoken its late commatoken but the deal was up until 10 pm commatoken our bar tender was neglectful periodtoken periodtokenblame him  the chef made us feel like assholes for ordering because he looked at us from the kitchen with attitude periodtoken  b im sorry but we were sitting therefor at least 15 minutes before we were waited on by your bar tender in a nearly empty restaurant periodtoken  we tried to get the attention of him as we saw no one else was eating and you were starting to clean up for the night commatoken but you are also open until 1 am we saw periodtoken  c  dont make your customers feel like they did you an injustice or did something wrong periodtoken  if i had sat down and gave insults to you and the foodservice out the gate periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthen fine periodtoken  but we were just trying to grab a late night bite that you had advertised and not just  a good beer commatoken but a james beard nominated beer periodtoken  we use to live in ardmore and we were one of the first people to become tired hands fans with the opening of the first location periodtoken  we couldnt believe that a place this good could exist in the main line periodtoken  i was very insulted and disappointed tonight periodtoken","9771":"the food is 5 stars as far as fast food goes commatoken customer service is normally top notch periodtoken the reason for my lowered star review is because today my 3yearold slipped and fell backwards on her head because of careless employees who couldnt mop and dry properly periodtoken what made things worse is they didnt stop there careless actions until another young child boy slipped and fell on the other side of the dining area  near where they were mopping periodtoken it wasnt until that point that they decided to wring out the mop so it was less wet and easier for the person behind to dry periodtoken because of their careless actions two small kids fell periodtoken thats not ok in my book commatoken and we didnt even get an apology or anyone to check and see if my child who was upset and crying was ok periodtoken","9772":"ehhhhhh food was ok periodtoken tiny portions periodtoken there was literally five normal size tortellini on the plate periodtoken 5 periodtoken","9773":"i had the slinger and all the flavors felt off periodtoken  just not impressed periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken this is one of those trendy places that puts metro food on their menu but doesnt do it right periodtoken","9774":"i actually really like this place periodtoken they have an amazing variety of bagels and cream cheese spreads periodtoken however commatoken sometimes they are so stingy with their cream cheese where im literally eating a bagel with a thin barely there layer of cream cheese periodtoken and anytime i ask for the spicy veg cream cheese they always do half spicy veg and half plain or half jalape\u00f1o or half something periodtoken   if i wanted a mix i would ask for it periodtoken im not sure why theyre so weird about it and i dont even know it happens until after i leave periodtoken if im paying for a service i expect to be given what i asked for periodtoken its happened multiple times and i wish i could say im gonna just try one more time but i think im over it periodtoken  no i havent tried to talk to the people behind the counter about it because i didnt think i needed to especially when im directly telling you what i want periodtoken   good place over all but im wasting my money here by not getting what i want periodtoken","9775":"what huh eh   as much as i love the mass ave location commatoken this spot was a huge turn off periodtoken periodtoken so loud commatoken so suburban periodtoken periodtoken i hadnt been to this area in years and its freaking weird periodtoken  i guess if i gave up and split for the burbs id give it another shot periodtoken","9776":"bad chinese periodtoken fried rice was not good periodtoken mushy and pasty periodtoken  kung pao was okay but sauce was runny and thin periodtoken hot and sour soup lacked flavor periodtoken dont bother periodtoken","9777":"when in the 2nd st periodtokenlombard area while dodging the wawa drunks commatoken be sure to also stop in at cosi periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenor not periodtoken  cosi seems to be taking over philly even more than starbucks periodtoken  why  why do people rave over this stuff  great commatoken so they serve everything on this supposed manna from god known as flat bread periodtoken  it aint that killa commatoken kids periodtoken  whats wrong with having some substance to your baked good in which you sandwich your food of choice  the prices are stupefying for fast food periodtoken  eight bucks for a samitch served with either baby carrots or a crummy bag of chips  sheeeit  i can go to subway and get a five dolla sub and a big ol drank and good chips for less than the same deal at cosi periodtoken  and whats with that weird ass coffee bar  this place is so schizo periodtoken  it comes off as a joint that would have been inhabited by the types who would have frequented the old playboy clubs and smoked pipes and drank old fashioneds had it been around then periodtoken  its swankness is undercut by its sheer averageosity periodtoken  i can never finish a samitch here because its so underwhelming periodtoken","9778":"this restaurant used to be good but now the food is very average and the man that waited on us recently was so rudehe acted like he didnt want to be bothered doing his job","9779":"it is just not as good as allegro periodtoken  the owner apparently trained in the same place as the owner of allegro commatoken however the execution falls short periodtoken  the flavors are not as good commatoken nor is the service periodtoken  they only offered mixed flavors on medium and above periodtoken  just go to allegros","9780":"i got a giftcard to this restaurant for christmas and as my mother and i had both heard good things id thought wed give it a shot periodtoken i knew the restaurant gets packed on friday and saturday nights so we went on a sunday night periodtoken there was a healthy amount of people and so there was some wait time commatoken a little more than i think there should have been honestly periodtoken  the menu is pretty decent commatoken all the standard texmex fair commatoken burritos commatoken enchiladas commatoken quesadillas etc  commatoken mostly meat based but there are plenty of options for vegetarians as well periodtoken the decor is warm but super hipster and trendy periodtoken i appreciated it periodtoken   sadly commatoken all the food we had was lackluster periodtoken i had a chicken torta which was alright except for the very blackened chicken which i never really enjoyed periodtoken my mother got a steak enchiladaburrito concoction which she didnt enjoy too much and from what  i saw appeared to be more peppersonions than anything else periodtoken  honestly i wont be going back here periodtoken its just not worth it periodtoken","9781":"first love the concept of bff caf\u00e9 commatoken the concept is long overdue commatoken and sorely needed   i tried bff a while back on a monday and found out there only do fuel packs commatoken which is take and heat at home and or you can heat up there periodtoken that didnt interest me commatoken so i said i would be back periodtoken   i arrived today commatoken and was excited to eat here commatoken as i tried a small sample at a yelp elite event yee periodtoken i ordered at the counter with a younger gentlemen and it wasnt busy to me commatoken 1 guy waiting and 2 people already eating commatoken and 1 couple behind me periodtoken   i asked what to order as i was really hungry commatoken and the gentlemen right off the bat said the bison burger 16 without skipping a beat periodtoken i rarely eat bison and i was craving what i had at the yee commatoken and next he said paleo hunter zoodle commatoken either one was super filling periodtoken   total for food was 3 for cauliflower fingers commatoken 12 for the paleo hunter zoodle periodtoken a full check plus small tip was just over 17 commatoken thats wout a drink i consider this a high price point for a lunch periodtoken   i thoroughly checked over restaurant commatoken something feels missing here commatoken not sure commatoken what best describes periodtoken my best interpretation is its feel like an empty cafeteria commatoken order here commatoken fill your drink here commatoken get condiments over there commatoken and bus your table commatoken basically no service commatoken order commatoken and just wait periodtoken i had a number on my table and the food comes out commatoken a bit slow considering there was 1 order in front of me commatoken and i think the dish i ordered much of it was premade like braised beef commatoken vegetable noodles commatoken etc periodtoken   my dish arrives and it looks naked commatoken i only ate a sample at the yee commatoken so i didnt know why it felt naked commatoken but i felt like there should be a sauce over it or on the side commatoken as it looks very much naked commatoken i was quite confused because my cauliflower c fingers had a salsa side periodtoken i tried the c fingers first commatoken as its my guess is its the c pizza commatoken cut into strips commatoken to make the fingers periodtoken i had enough salsa for about half of them commatoken and it was okay commatoken kind of cool to be able to order a unique side commatoken but wouldnt need to order it again commatoken as the flavor was okay to below okay commatoken not enough c for me also no notations on nutrition on this dish nor other handhelds   i am looking at my main dish the paleo hunter commatoken and again commatoken it feels so naked commatoken i start thinking about what sauces i can add to it commatoken but nothing looks like a match commatoken but i did notice a wasabi in the cooler when waiting to order commatoken and thought if its real wasabi that might give it a bit of flavor and heat commatoken and at least add much much needed moisture to this dish that looks like it needed something to blanket periodtoken please note commatoken i did ask cashier commatoken who said it was okay to grab the wasabi dixie cup from the cooler periodtoken    i added the sauce very carefully and then being a professional salad tosser western village steakhouse from 1994 commatoken i tossed my dish expertly and thoroughly in case the wasabi was super hot commatoken which i was hoping it was it was not i started eating the dish commatoken and the first i notice it was below lukewarm in temperature commatoken it was just between cold and luke warm commatoken i was quite confused periodtoken   i spent only about 23 minutes eating the c fingers commatoken so that couldnt be it commatoken the wasabi from the cooler was about 1 periodtoken5 oz dixie cup commatoken carefully poured to cover the dish commatoken why was my dish almost cold commatoken maybe thats how they do it here commatoken its a unique place commatoken serving unique commatoken maybe they dont want the nutrients to cook off i wasnt sure commatoken but then again commatoken i really didnt want to just eat it and assume commatoken so i waited to talk to the cashier commatoken who really just takes orders and gets food from the back commatoken but all of the sudden it took over 5 minutes and a phone order commatoken to get his attention periodtoken   i said commatoken should my food be almost cold he said yeah maybe commatoken because it didnt sit under the heat lamp that long periodtoken i was still puzzled so i said commatoken how was it cooked he said on the stove periodtoken i was was still puzzled commatoken his answer was that yeah commatoken if it goes from the stove to the plate to your table that happens periodtoken okay commatoken i decided to eat the food as it was commatoken and as i did i realized commatoken i was never eat here again commatoken so its really simple commatoken just eat commatoken leave commatoken and a solid review commatoken to let my fans know the biz i want to save you  commatoken if you value it   again love the concept of bff commatoken but based on today experience this place is not for me last but not least commatoken as i was relaying the story to coworkers commatoken because you know the power of a bad experience commatoken you usually share 10x and a good experience 1x commatoken i remembered commatoken looking at the menu commatoken and then i remembered being at my yee event commatoken that this dish is suppose to have a blanket commatoken which today was missing commatoken and that is the chimichurri sauce that was another aha moment of the terrible experience i had today periodtoken   last note the cashier told me that they had a big rush before me thats why the food didnt sit under the heat lamp long enough to warm up the food commatoken i guess that big to go order before me really stressed the chef the guy sitting down that i saw leave with a bag of food probably for a family of 23 adults and 23 kid commatoken thats pressure","9782":"decent place for food commatoken cheap and the quality is okay periodtoken but the wait for the food is absolutely unbearable commatoken it took them 40 minutes to make a chicken quesadilla wrap which is normally a 3 minute process periodtoken however i did get to bond with some other customers because they were also waiting for over 30 minutes periodtoken not worth the wait in my opinion","9783":"tried this place a few days after opening periodtoken id get into a lengthier review commatoken but everyone else has taken care of that periodtoken  imo commatoken 5 guys is far and away the best periodtoken this burger was very dry commatoken and not very tasty periodtoken fries are ok periodtoken i think when all the hype dies this place will be forgotten periodtoken","9784":"the staff were friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant was fairly good periodtoken the problem is i got cheese fries to go and when i opened the box it was just plain fries no cheese  i basically paid couple of extra dollars for nothing periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9785":"i really tried to love hipcity commatoken i really truthfully did however commatoken every single time i come by to give it another chance and purchase a groothie commatoken its always lukewarm and doesnt sit right with me commatoken or my coworkers periodtoken whats the deal commatoken hipcity   ill give it another try the next time i come by periodtoken hopefully this wont be a disappointment periodtoken","9786":"i was a bit disappointed periodtoken ordered the spicy beef soup and it wasnt hot or spicy enough periodtoken the soup had a flavor to it i didnt like periodtoken their iced tea was great periodtoken like that you can customize flavors periodtoken the place is very clean and the staff are friendly periodtoken i would go back just for the tea periodtoken","9787":"cute place with nice patio but thats about all thats good periodtoken i waited for my friend for about 10 minutes no one even came over to offer a drink or water for that matter periodtoken way over priced for what you get periodtoken","9788":"the hot coffee was on the lukewarm periodtoken  i dont  think this was a fluke since all the selections were this way periodtoken  ate a bun that had nuts and a hard carmel on top periodtoken  flavor was good but the carmel was  cooked to the candy stage and was impossible to cut with a knife periodtoken   ambiance is mellow and the dining area would be great to meet groups of friends periodtoken","9789":"ehh commatoken its definitely good when you finally get your order periodtoken last time we came they gave us fries instead of rice periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenon top of taking 20 minutes periodtoken today we have been sitting in the drive thru for 20 minutes they just finally acknowledged us and we are still waiting periodtoken cannot wait to to find a decent jimboys somewhere in reno periodtoken   and were still waiting periodtoken","9790":"i walked in with my husband on a friday afternoon after the auto show periodtoken i was so excited to experience the burger and service at the range periodtoken i ordered the blgt burger periodtoken the side of chips was a necessary add as all of the tables were eating these delicious looking fried side items periodtoken i ordered my burger well periodtoken what i received was a cold commatoken well done commatoken over goat cheesed commatoken gloppy burger periodtoken my husband was underwhelmed as well with the traditional periodtoken the chips are fantastic periodtoken   i will try again because i try everything 3 times to make sure i hate it periodtoken","9791":"because its so darn close commatoken my husband and i have been here several times and i must say commatoken weve been progressively more disappointed commatoken which is why im writing this review periodtoken unless you plan on dining at pk in the 500 hour commatoken its very crowded and loud commatoken to the point where we have to shout to hear each other across the table periodtoken so much for intimate conversation another thing we have noticed is that we are treated differently if one or both of us orders an alcoholic beverage periodtoken were not big drinkers and when we choose not to have beer or wine with our meal commatoken we shouldnt feel pressured to do so in the hopes that well receive better service periodtoken a classic example the last time we were there commatoken our waitress was visibly disappointed that we werent ordering drinks and told us that the kitchen was backed up about 30 minutes and that it would probably take a while for us to get our food periodtoken we waited for a little while commatoken and the waitress came back once or twice to see if we wanted anything from the bar commatoken until my husband finally caved and ordered a beer periodtoken wouldnt you know it  the waitresss attitude changed and our food came out about a minute later periodtoken how convenient periodtoken finally commatoken a note about the food periodtoken weve been with pk through a few menu changes now and the latest menu revision is very disappointing periodtoken they got rid of our favorite items on the menu  the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the parliament burger periodtoken the menu offers a roasted pork sandwich commatoken which is supposed to be a spinoff of the kind youd get at dinics in reading terminal commatoken but it fails periodtoken the only burger choice is now the 18 burger churchill commatoken i think commatoken probably due to the fact that when they had 2 burger choices commatoken im sure more people ordered the 14 option periodtoken clever periodtoken speaking of the new pork sandwich and burger commatoken just a headsup they will ask you if you want a salad or fries commatoken even though they charge you extra for the fries commatoken a fact that they fail to disclose when you think you actually have an equal choice periodtoken i think the bottom line for us is that we dont really have a reason to come back here for a while commatoken between the disappointing menu and the tacit pressure to order alcohol periodtoken","9792":"over priced for the quality periodtoken for this reason i didnt tip periodtoken akira is way better commatoken the price is a little cheaper and you get more for your buck periodtoken the waiter was bold enough to  come to my car and ask me why i didnt tip periodtoken that is so rude periodtoken she asked me if the food was bad or something commatoken  i wanted to be honest but i would be hurting her feelings if i did that periodtoken  she made me feel uncomfortable the entire time periodtoken after she walked back in commatoken i guess it was the manager or whoever commatoken he came to the door and began to stare at me like there was a problem periodtoken  i will never go to this  dead restaurant again periodtoken  i see why its so dead there periodtoken the food was nothing to go crazy for and it doesnt help that they have rude staff periodtoken thumbs down","9793":"trivia fun periodtoken  food decent commatoken although i like their beer selection and buffalo sauce periodtoken  service had a tall order to keep up with the good trivia crowd periodtoken there was about 6 good size parties periodtoken but commatoken i came in at 800 and was served my food at 920 after ordering at approx 830 periodtoken no apology periodtoken just a defensive manager that gave me a military discount for my troubles of waiting close to an hour for my food im estimating periodtoken  im military periodtoken when they picked up my check with their 20tip commatoken in cash she laughed periodtoken down and dirty commatoken thats what happened periodtoken we bring a group here every wednesday and this service was not acceptable periodtoken","9794":"overpriced and not worth the hype periodtoken the food is okay commatoken but nothing i couldnt cook at home periodtoken i dont enjoy spending 15 dollars on a meal if i dont leave full and im not wowed by it periodtoken","9795":"subways are generally pretty solid and i would give them 3 stars overall as a chain due to their healthy options periodtoken  however commatoken some locations are better than others commatoken and this one is the pits  the space is tiny and cramped commatoken so if youre looking to eat in the subway commatoken you might want to get it to go periodtoken  the sandwich bread and ingredients werent as fresh as ive had at other locations commatoken either commatoken and they certainly skimp on the fillings periodtoken  but the main reason this subway gets 2 stars is because the service is terrible  the two employees were incredibly dour and unhelpful and acted simply disgusted to be serving my girlfriend and me maybe they just dont like samesex couples periodtoken  i dont go to subways often commatoken but i definitely wont be back to this location periodtoken","9796":"they really are strange periodtoken definitely something you have to be in the mood to eat periodtoken their pbj donut is great but the gooey commatoken fruit loop topped and cake based are not good periodtoken the actual donut is really dry periodtoken","9797":"food was okay periodtoken  their only salad dressing had little flavor commatoken and their spicy chicken sandwich was deep fried and dry periodtoken  however commatoken the sevice was exceptional periodtoken","9798":"in full disclosure commatoken i really enjoy going to pei wei for take out periodtoken  i dont get to go often commatoken but when i do i really look forward to it periodtoken  i was happy that my wife suggested take out at pei wei commatoken but after my meal commatoken disappointed is the only word that came to mind periodtoken    my wifes noodle dish was average commatoken but my pei wei spicy was well below average periodtoken  it was dry and tasteless periodtoken  it tasted like the meat was reheated commatoken and they forgot to sauce the rest of the dish periodtoken  i also had ordered extra vegetables commatoken but i could tell there was nothing extra periodtoken    hopefully this was a one time occasion commatoken otherwise pei wei will be off the list periodtoken","9799":"horrible experience periodtoken all the dim sum was dried and cold periodtoken the waitstaff was like their dim sum periodtoken my sister really wanted good chinese food and we found this place via yelp periodtoken disappointed periodtoken","9800":"i recently moved to st pete from nyc and at first glance i was excited for a great healthy smoothie periodtoken 14 for a smoothie and 5 for a coffee periodtoken those prices are ridiculous compared to nyc periodtoken the coffee was regular drip not some artisan coffee periodtoken the smoothie took 30min to get because the staff was too busy talking periodtoken","9801":"ive been coming to josefs for years and today i decided i will never return periodtoken between the consistently shitty service commatoken the incorrect orders commatoken the lukewarm at best food and always moldy tasting potatoes i have lost all my love for josefs periodtoken to add insult to injury the last three times i have dined at this restaurant within the past month sonja commatoken the owner is sitting on her butt commatoken being no help to the frantic servers or the obviously over run kitchen periodtoken i hate writing this review commatoken but i hate poorly run businesses more periodtoken please commatoken please get your act together josefs","9802":"this was my first time ordering from this place periodtoken i read all the reviews and it sounded really good periodtoken unfortunately commatoken i was highly disappointed periodtoken  i ordered the cheesesteak with fried onions with a side of  tomato soup periodtoken  i also ordered the macaroni and cheese periodtoken the cheesesteak was good periodtoken what ruined it was they put black pepper all over it periodtoken i dont like black pepper on my cheesesteaks periodtoken  the tomato soup was horrible periodtoken it had taco spice in it or cumin or something like that periodtoken i dont like southwestern spices commatoken unless im eating a taco periodtoken  the macaroni cheese was the biggest disappointment periodtoken absolutely no flavor periodtoken who is rating this stuff high stars people who obviously dont know good food periodtoken it was nasty periodtoken i threw it out periodtoken   will never order again from them periodtoken ill stick to  tony sopranos pizza periodtoken","9803":"the hot spot stopped my companys headquarters for lunch today commatoken and i was not impressed periodtoken  im somewhat of a fried chicken snob periodtoken  if i were on death row commatoken fried chicken would be my last meal periodtoken  anyway commatoken im not a fan of hot chicken in general periodtoken  i took a bite of a coworkers twisted chicken wing commatoken and decided to give the chicken a shot periodtoken  it was good for one bite commatoken but as i ate more commatoken i found it to be overly salty from the pseudo jamaican jerk seasoning periodtoken  the sriracha was a nice touch commatoken and i probably

better food periodtoken","9804":"we were at international plaza and decided to give this a try since we like sushi a lot periodtoken the conveyor belt idea is fun commatoken but annoying since you have to identify everything sailing by by looking at the menu periodtoken by the time we identified it commatoken it was long gone periodtoken a gimmick that doesnt work for me periodtoken the menu is terribly annoying because there are no prices next to any item commatoken just a color coded bowl periodtoken so for every item i had to look back at the legend over and over again periodtoken

special periodtoken i honestly would rather just get iced coffee at steins next door tastes a million times better and is 30 minutes faster periodtoken   however commatoken the donut gains a little

periodtoken periodtokenobviously poorly managed base on the employees drinking before the customers","9815":"i dont mind fast food restaurants and i generally dont have high expectations commatoken

menu items commatoken but no commatoken we should have taken that as a sign periodtoken   the next thing that happened was a girl approached us from the counter to let us know they were having their grills replaced that day commatoken and no hot food was available periodtoken this cut the menu down to about 10 items periodtoken we ended up getting andys orbit salad and hummus envy to split periodtoken i decided that i was annoyed that they acted like it was an inconvenience to make a hot drink for my friend who wanted one of their signature coffees periodtoken   im not really sure why we were asked if we were dining in or ordering takeout if the food was to be served in a plastic takeout box either way periodtoken the hummus might have been good by itself commatoken but the amount of toppings in it really just eliminated the experience periodtoken there is a such thing as too much going on in one bite commatoken and the bites were hard because their homemade pita chips were like rocks periodtoken i was seriously worried i was going to break my teeth on them periodtoken we asked for strictly kalearugula mix without the lettuce commatoken and they didnt serve that properly periodtoken overall commatoken it was pretty bland commatoken and the dressing didnt do it much help periodtoken   the saving grace here was their fresh fruit tea was pretty good commatoken but not enough to earn them a better review periodtoken rule of thumb periodtoken if youre remodeling the kitchen commatoken and it will kill 90 of your menu just close for the day periodtoken","9839":"it is

lacking inspiration and originality periodtoken i hope it was just picked over and that wasnt the best they had to offer periodtoken portions of the store are best described as poorly displayed commatoken tired sameold grandma gifts galore periodtoken need a knit scarf or note cards you could make yourself from a low end kit from michaels how about hat from cheap yarn the alpaca items were worth the trip commatoken but not much else periodtoken","9857":"i dont prefer this location at all periodtoken its near my dwelling commatoken and this morning i thought of giving them another second

there periodtoken the wife ordered the pork steak sandwich and i had the pork steak dinner periodtoken i knew when they set the food on the table and saw my pork steak something was wrong the pork steak was thin commatoken small and it looked like they took a spoon and smeared the sauce on periodtoken i always have just used a fork to cut it but it was tough periodtoken the taste wasnt bad but i was truly surprised they brought it out ive been going to bullys since it opened and always had a great pork steak and sides periodtoken i hope that this was just a bad day and the food gets better

was not a good experience periodtoken  the crabcakes were less than memorable commatoken while the staff  was quite unfriendly periodtoken  we may give it another shot sometime this summer periodtoken","9860":"sorry to be a downer commatoken but this place did not meet my expectations periodtoken from the getgo commatoken i wasnt thrilled about their hours as im usually in st

excited periodtoken but then this weirdo hipster dude behind the counter gives me a dead stare and goes commatoken hows it going commatoken man periodtoken ummm okay periodtoken so i browsed briefly and made a selection of four of what i believed to be the most popular donuts there the gooey butter commatoken campfire commatoken blueberry cheesecake and the one with bacon shreds on top periodtoken   after the quick transaction commatoken i started munching on them on the way to my car commatoken and i just couldnt believe it periodtoken i tasted the gooey butter one first commatoken and it was one of those yeast commatoken fluffy donuts with very little topping on it periodtoken i thought this was going to be gooey and moist commatoken in cakedonut form periodtoken it didnt taste like gooey butter cake at all periodtoken not cool commatoken gang periodtoken same goes for the one with bacon periodtoken i like bacon on a lot of things commatoken but it could have tasted better on a cake donut periodtoken the campfire one was a cakedonut commatoken so it kind of made up for it periodtoken i gave the blueberry cheesecake one to a friend commatoken but he had no reaction periodtoken there is one thing i learned after coming here the big difference between fluffy yeast donuts and the moist commatoken cake donuts periodtoken if i want fluffy yeast donuts commatoken ill just go to schnucks periodtoken cake donuts are where its at  so again commatoken i dont mean to come off as someone who is hard to please commatoken but this was a wellhyped place and i bought into it periodtoken and im from glen carbon commatoken on the other side of the river periodtoken i respect small businesses and i know its a donut shop commatoken but try to stay open at reasonable times

out wrong periodtoken  the servers always act as if they are panicked and slammed even if there are few people there periodtoken  dinner 1 star periodtoken  they only serve dinner on fridays periodtoken  after being there for brunch so many times commatoken i was really excited to try their dinner menu periodtoken  we went on january 16th commatoken 2015 periodtoken  unfortunately commatoken it was perhaps the worst dining experience of my life periodtoken  i wont bore you with too many details commatoken just the lowlights  service was unbelievably slow periodtoken  the meal took 2 periodtoken5 hours this was just with appetizers and entrees periodtoken  15 minutes after my husband ordered his meal the waiter told him they were out commatoken so he ordered something else periodtoken  his meal therefore showed up 10 minutes after everyone elses periodtoken  one of the appetizers had grapes and many of the grapes had visible mold on them periodtoken  this was really unacceptable periodtoken  the mussels i ordered were so cold i had to send them back periodtoken i really hope it was just a bad night for the restaurant periodtoken  it was clear that every table was experiencing similar issues periodtoken  ive never seen so many tables of angry people periodtoken  the waiter did take the moldy appetizer off the bill commatoken and offered us free dessert commatoken but after such a terrible meal and being there for far longer than we planned commatoken we passed periodtoken  i havent been back since that disastrous dinner commatoken not even for

maybe below average mcdonalds but the manager that works dinner time is very nice and helpful with kid related issues clean ups commatoken extra happy meal toys commatoken etc periodtoken  i say below

periodtoken","9864":"i only go here when i cant find what i am looking for somewhere else periodtoken  the store is actually fine and i never have any problems here periodtoken  it just seems that the congestion in the parking lot is very high and the chances of getting caught in a game of bumper cars seems much higher than at other places i shop periodtoken  thats the big issue for me so when i go i park in the boonies and hike in","9865":"nothing particularly wrong with the farm  though there are others in the area just as or even more engaging  but the pricing is out of control and definitely not worth what you pay for periodtoken everything is an additional price for everyone ie parents have to pay to supervise their kids on a playground and even with one kid it adds up periodtoken super disappointing periodtoken it wasnt always like this periodtoken cant imagine going back again periodtoken just not worth it periodtoken","9866":"concierge recommended this place  so off we went periodtoken  service was a bit slow commatoken which i can handle if the food is good periodtoken  it was not periodtoken  since they were stil serving lunch commatoken we ordered the po boy special shrimp sauteed in spicy citrus butter w spicy slaw and a po boy with grilled shrimp periodtoken  the bread on the special was hard and the sauteed shrimp was super bland commatoken as in they did not bother to season it periodtoken  to add insult to injury commatoken the shrimp were extremely small and not cleaned periodtoken  i will admit that grilled shrimp po boy was not on the menu only fried commatoken so i was taking a chance with the modification periodtoken  but commatoken there is no excuse for not seasing the shrimp at all  the seafood gumbo was not bad  i would give it a b    all in all a highly disappointing meal periodtoken","9867":"i have been to bareburgers all throughout new york and have always loved them periodtoken tonight my experience in philadelphia was less than happy

gross periodtoken it gets soggy and is much bigger than the burger periodtoken  2 the fries were exceptionally cold and soggy periodtoken i know fried foods doesnt stay great for long commatoken but i ate my meal almost immediately after ordering and they tasted raw periodtoken  3 the slaw commatoken i dont even know how it can be called that periodtoken it was completely dry commatoken had no flavor periodtoken it literally tasted like brussels sprouts were shredded with red onion or shallots and thats it periodtoken i took two bites and throw it away periodtoken  for 20 periodtoken52 to eat a burger with fries and coleslaw commatoken i expect to thoroughly enjoy my meal periodtoken i did not at all commatoken and actually am still hungry periodtoken very disappointing

the coffee was fine periodtoken yes there was some pretty latte art commatoken but besides that it was nothing especially remarkable periodtoken the ambiance is neat  sort of a rustic meets industrial vibe periodtoken the place was packed my friends and i managed to find some space at the long table commatoken and those stools are definitely the antithesis of comfortable periodtoken the choice was style over comfort periodtoken and the parking situation really crappy periodtoken oof periodtoken  now commatoken the real reason im not loving bb that much  the service periodtoken the lumberjackesque man who served our coffees was fine commatoken but the hipster dbag we ordered from was a total turnoff periodtoken he wasnt friendly to begin with commatoken and then when there was some joking over spelling my friends name commatoken he got sort of offended periodtoken questions were also clearly not welcome periodtoken guess you have to be a regular and know exactly what you want to be on this guys good side periodtoken all i could do the entire time was think of chris hardwicks bit during the transaction commatoken hipsters commatoken please dont work in the service industry periodtoken you dont want to serve us commatoken we dont want to be served by you periodtoken   i was cursing the recommendation to hit this spot as a meeting point im not sure i would ever go back without someone asking to meet me there periodtoken","9872":"honestly commatoken i wasnt impressed at all periodtoken the looks of the donuts is for sure a good selling point commatoken but the taste is where it all went downhill periodtoken   my wife and i went by the shop a couple of hours after they opened commatoken but well before they closed for the day periodtoken we got 6 different donuts so we could try a variety periodtoken the only two we found to be decent were a raspberry filled one and a basic vanilla one with sprinkles commatoken which you can find at any donut shop periodtoken the rest were very dry and bland oreo topped one commatoken french toast one commatoken graham cracker topped one and a gooey butter cake one periodtoken   then comes the price periodtoken i understand that these donuts are different from others commatoken but 9 and some change for 6 donuts was pretty high periodtoken   we may not eat donuts all that often commatoken but next time we will be going elsewhere periodtoken","9873":"mediocre food commatoken terrible service from the bartender on up to the server periodtoken bartender was annoyed that she had to do her job periodtoken didnt want to tip her but did because we were told it was a 35 minute wait and i was afraid wed be back at the bar for drinks before being seated periodtoken husband had the crab cakes premade commatoken probably previously frozen periodtoken my mahi mahi was so dry and overcooked it could have been mistaken for chicken periodtoken mahi and crab cakes both way over seasoned periodtoken only positive is that we were able to get our 9 year old foodie a kids lobster tail for 11 periodtoken99 instead of buying an adult portion for 3x the price periodtoken do not recommend commatoken will not go back periodtoken","9874":"the chef was angry and you could hear it commatoken  the staff did their best to put smile on face so credit to them  the food was not properly cooked for example my wife ordered poached eggs 1 was perfect and the other was hard periodtoken    i ordered scrambled eggs and they were runny  that is difficult to mess up periodtoken     the hash browns were awesome and the staff did their best  but plenty of better options avail periodtoken","9875":"i really dislike this place periodtoken periodtoken theres nothing nothing nothing to do other than see machines eat your money well and drink commatoken but im not an alcoholic nor a gambler periodtoken periodtoken so after one over priced drink and a walk around the money eating machines im done  if you go to the one in hollywood commatoken fl then you will know what im talking about periodtoken  this place is just a casino commatoken i mean if you are looking for just playing periodtoken periodtoken and wasting ur money you must go  if you want to have fun commatoken and have a drink and look for things to do periodtoken periodtoken dont go  its better to stay home periodtoken periodtoken really theres nothing to do periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   well other than eat periodtoken periodtoken the restaurants are pricey but good thats the reason im giving 2 stars

should count my blessings in the back of the restaurant through the doors is a really nice commatoken intimate venue periodtoken its ashame the bartenders suck periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the bar was extremely crowded so i understood the long wait commatoken however generally if theres and event  commatoken most places will staff more than one bartender periodtoken its a novel idea commatoken but it just might work   so after my friend and i got tired of waiting we went to the periodtokenmain bar and the chick bartending had the nastiest attitude and horrible customer service periodtoken she proceeded to walk past us twice and serve other customers eventhough we told her wed like to order commatoken and the other patrons came up after us periodtoken so we went back to the slow bartender periodtoken and after he took 25 mins to get our order and spent another 20 commatokenmins reading the ingriedients on the menu to make our carribean punches we got our drinks in less than an hour periodtoken based on that experience i would never patronize the restaurant plus the parking situation is atrocious periodtoken sux too cause the drink actually turned out good periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9877":"sadly commatoken since my initial glowing review dooners as gone way down hill periodtoken   disregard my previous rating and remarks periodtoken its no

apart and earned the high ratings periodtoken","9878":"i love dd coffee  donuts periodtoken but this location has the worst service periodtoken its frustrating when the counter person talks to other

periodtoken periodtokenget involved or get out","9879":"super disappointing periodtoken after standing in the rain to get in commatoken the food was not good periodtoken my husband ordered the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns periodtoken there was one slice of bacon and the hash browns were bland and watery periodtoken i got the shrimp and grits periodtoken the shrimp had a really good

we wont be back periodtoken","9880":"i been here twice and both times i left feeling disappointed periodtoken dont get me wrong commatoken the place has major potential periodtoken the old building is charming and they have a vegetarian menu commatoken but based on my dining experiences i dont think anyone in the kitchen understands what a vegetarian is periodtoken the first time i came here i ordered the veggie reuben it was super tasty commatoken but midway through my lunch i discovered that someone in the kitchen had accidentally put corned beef on my sandwich and decided it would be ok to pick it off periodtoken not ok periodtoken the second time i came here i ordered another one of their sandwiches i cant recall which one but it was pretty much just lettuce on dry bread periodtoken totally disgusting periodtoken i really wanted to like the whistle stop but after my experiences i wont be headed back periodtoken","9881":"its part diner commatoken part kosher style deli periodtoken no part of it would stop me from going up the street to kibitz room for food that is infinitely better periodtoken","9882":"once upon a time commatoken companion was my number one lunch spot in st

periodtokenits just not the same the menu has changed for the worse imo commatoken the service is consistently poor commatoken the prices are in no way fair periodtoken also commatoken on multiple visits i have spotted a mouse trap in the main dining room empty commatoken but still unappetizing periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe iced tea commatoken cornbread and variety of soups are the only things that keep me coming back periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenwell commatoken and the memory of companions glory days in the cwe periodtoken so commatoken masochists if youre looking to choke down pretentious 13 salads and like eating at wobbly tables commatoken companion is your best bet","9883":"i went to the bakery house after reading other yelp reviews commatoken hoping that the positive commatoken 5star notes rang true periodtoken i am sad to say that i agree with the people who said the baked goods are overpriced and surprisingly mediocre periodtoken maybe i just didnt order the right thing periodtoken it seems like everyone loves the birthday sheet cakes periodtoken i purchased a small strawberry rhubarb pie at 22 periodtoken yes commatoken 22 periodtoken for that kind of money commatoken i expect the pie to be a periodtokenm periodtokena periodtokenz periodtokeni periodtokenn periodtokeng periodtoken in a word not periodtoken it was okay it certainly wasnt bad periodtoken but the filling was very soupy and too sugary sweet periodtoken i love the bite of rhubarb and i didnt taste it at all periodtoken theres a chance ill give the bakery house another shot

the 40 minutes to exton in friday evening traffic and were pleased by the overall appearance periodtoken we joked about their website as han dynasty types as handynasty and in the end commatoken it did turn out to be handy nasty periodtoken service was slow commatoken unfriendly and incorrect when asked questions periodtoken  we ordered the won ton soup commatoken fried dumplings and dan dan noodles as apps periodtoken they were ok periodtoken the soup was cold and the dan dan noodles commatoken i thought commatoken had a weird taste periodtoken the dumplings were thick and the dumpling sauce tasteless periodtoken  we ordered a variety of mains periodtoken however commatoken my dinner didnt come out until the rest of my party was finished eating periodtoken i had to sit there and watch everyone not really enjoy their meals periodtoken apparently periodtoken the shredded duck was super salty commatoken the crispy noodles which when asked what they entailed were told noodles with a sauce commatoken came out looking like a bed of noodles under slimy breaded pieces of something periodtoken we thought it may have been beef commatoken chicken and fish periodtoken my friend was disappointed because he didnt eat beef or fish commatoken my other 2 friends liked their dishes commatoken garlic shrimp  kung pao chicken periodtoken my kung pao shrimp came out and tasted nice but the little bit of rice was cold and no server ever came back to the table to see if we needed anything periodtoken we complained to the manager and she took 10 off our bill but it didnt really make up for the fact that our nice dinner out was ruined periodtoken  thankfully we had desert back at the house periodtoken","9888":"went in for shortbread cookies and birthday cupcakes and they were pretty disappointing periodtoken shortbread was bland and they had a fondant cutout instead of regular icing that wasnt sweet enough periodtoken i ended up throwing most of the cookie out periodtoken the cupcake was also disappointing periodtoken a little hint of vanilla but nothing great periodtoken   the prices were way off periodtoken the cookie i got was over 4 because it was a special themed cutout commatoken but the cupcakes and other large cookies were half that periodtoken   id go back for a second chance because their lemon bars looked really good commatoken but wouldnt go back for much else","9889":"second time to this location and theyre out of bubblegum ice cream periodtoken thats the last time i drive across town for you baskin robbins playing with my sweet tooth is like playing with my emotions","9890":"one thing starbucks does well is brand recognition periodtoken this was my first time to this location and it looks like all the others so i felt like i had been there a million times before periodtoken this can be seen as a positive and a negative  it is great because you are familiar with the layout and the menus etc but not so great because there is no individuality commatoken uniqueness commatoken or more personal feel to the place periodtoken  the drinks and treats are exactly what is expected from a starbucks location any starbucks location periodtoken what separates the good from the bad is location and service periodtoken unfortunately this particular starbucks fails on both accounts periodtoken  i went at 430pm on a saturday afternoon and the place was not busy however finding a parking spot and negotiating the parking lot was a feat all on its own periodtoken unfortunately there is a tt supermarket directly across the parking lot and all of these customers were consuming the parking and walking haphazardly in the paved lot periodtoken this made it a unique challenge even to get in the door periodtoken  once i had made it in i was able to walk right up to the counter and attempt to order periodtoken the baristas were all busy cleaning and so it took a while to get their attention but eventually i placed my order periodtoken the friend i was meeting had arrived before me so instead of waiting at the counter for my drink i sat with her and chatted for a while periodtoken next thing i realize that ten minutes had gone by and my drink was still not prepared so back up to the counter i went periodtoken again all of the baristas were cleaning machines and organizing items behind the counter  they all had forgotten about my drink periodtoken luckily i was not in a rush because from the time i walked in until i received my beverage was over 15 minutes periodtoken   there are two other starbucks at the intersection of 97th street and 137th ave and without being to either i would recommend trying both of them over this location periodtoken","9891":"ice cream is good commatoken but overpriced periodtoken  also the

periodtokenbut ive had my share of bbq in the st periodtoken louis area periodtoken for starters commatoken my pulled pork sandwich arrived a bit on the cold side the actual bbq itself was cold commatoken not hot like bbq should be  periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand adding cole slaw for 1 was not a game changer as the waitress touted periodtoken in fact commatoken the cole slaw was rather bland and i scraped it away from the bbq after realizing such periodtoken  the variety of sauces were okay until i actually tried them periodtoken none of them had good flavor periodtoken the sides i chose were potato salad and baked beans periodtoken the potato salad was also bland and oddly commatoken the potatoes were diced in small squares periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey lacked that starchy flavor and texture of commatoken you know commatoken a potato periodtoken the baked beans are frankly no pun intended commatoken an embarrassment periodtoken too sweet and totally taste like they are canned and ive had some tasty canned baked beans periodtoken  the coworker who suggested this place ordered a philly brisket sandwich and ill admit it looked good but alas my lunch was below mediocre and i doubt ill revisit anytime soon periodtoken  service was alright periodtoken we did have to remind the waitress a few

bigger boxes periodtoken i did not pack mine togo nor did i finish it periodtoken","9894":"confusing periodtoken why do you need 6 different souvenir shops selling the same items in one building its like if you went to a mall that just had a dozen old navys periodtoken unnecessary periodtoken  anyway commatoken we came here for the food court commatoken which was also a bit of a disappointment periodtoken thankfully commatoken this place is more or less free of food chains at least major ones commatoken but the options available were still bleak commatoken especially for a vegetarian periodtoken i eventually selected a veggie burrito from the mexican vendor commatoken and it was acceptable commatoken but nothing worth writing home about periodtoken  i would have been most excited about the falafel place periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenif it had been open periodtoken it was only 5 pm on a tuesday periodtoken y u close so early","9895":"disclaimer i am only reviewing the takeoutrestaurant side of this business commatoken not the seafood market which may very well be perfectly fine commatoken i havent purchased uncooked seafood there yet periodtoken ive only got

commatoken and when properly made their prepared food is delicious periodtoken it is just so hit or miss periodtoken on a bad day your food is extremely late commatoken barely edible and servers are borderline rude or at least inattentive periodtoken on a good night commatoken the service quick and attentive commatoken the dishes are impeccable and im left wanting more periodtoken however commatoken unfortunately commatoken there are more bad days than good commatoken which is why i will not be returning periodtoken for the prices they charge commatoken i can find better in this city

let down too many times periodtoken","9896":"overall a cozy place periodtoken nice staff commatoken no complaints there periodtoken but ketchup exploded out the bottle on me periodtoken being from idaho commatoken i know fries and the truffle fries were limp and kinda gross periodtoken burger was on par with some restaurants that dont specialize on just that periodtoken personally the food there needs to burger up to do the restaurant justice periodtoken two stars is pretty much all i can give them periodtoken","9897":"a coworker bought me food to go from here on tuesday of this week for my birthday last week and today i got a dish i used to enjoy at a restaurant owned by the current owners parent in the mid 90s commatoken which i thought or was led to believe was the reincarnation of that dish commatoken more on that in a minute periodtoken   i will start my review on tuesday with the to go order for myself and two coworkers commatoken i arrived and waited about 7 minutes for the order when i arrived on time for pick up periodtoken i got the food commatoken it was quite messy when i made it to the office commatoken i was confused as to why commatoken but when i opened my dish i found out why there was at least a cup or two of sauce in my generals chicken commatoken i would say it was filled up to halfway in a standard to go square box periodtoken that immediately turned my off commatoken because i am not an super saucey person periodtoken the portion was decent and it came w steamed rice periodtoken   i dug in commatoken i was hungry commatoken it was super bready commatoken another turnoff for me periodtoken overall the flavor okay commatoken not mind blowing but good commatoken but with the volcano sauce which again made a mess in the bag commatoken getting on everything commatoken which i needed to wash off and the super breading commatoken i would give it 3 stars periodtoken also commatoken i asked for hot mustard and never received commatoken found out they only have cheap packets here commatoken no real mustard    the reason i went back so fast commatoken was i found out the new owners commatoken parents used to own golden flower on virginia street by sports west periodtoken i fell in love with the lemon grass chicken there commatoken and would get it at least 1x per week periodtoken this was when i was young and had little money commatoken so if i spent money consistently commatoken that was money that delivered to me in all the ways possible periodtoken i used to love that dish commatoken and i have never found a replacement in town that even comes close it commatoken in taste or value periodtoken when the new owner implied she had the recipes before golden flower was sold in 1995 to the current owners commatoken who i found out just sold it this year commatoken invited back to see if i agreed commatoken which i readily accepted periodtoken   i arrived today to sit and order commatoken but it was 1215pm commatoken so prime lunch time for friday commatoken and it was about 1015 tables commatoken and many looked like they just sat commatoken so i decided to take it to go thinking it would be faster periodtoken i didnt look at the menu commatoken ordered ala carte commatoken paid and then was told 1520 minutes periodtoken not my favorite thing to hear commatoken but i already paid commatoken so i waited patiently commatoken again expecting a long lost favorite dish resurrected from a cherished time remembered commatoken ready to reexperience with the most likely person to recreate the daughter of the owners who was there during that special time   i got to the office commatoken and started paying attention to my food i was anxiously anticipating eating commatoken and i noticed the weight was light commatoken it didnt feel like a meal commatoken i was hoping i was wrong periodtoken i got to the lunch room opened the bag commatoken and looked it over and it didnt look like a big portion nor did it have lemon grass periodtoken it didnt look wow commatoken just like huh commatoken so i dug in hoping the flavors were there commatoken and sadly they were not the chicken was overcooked commatoken no lemongrass commatoken a few scallion were there commatoken some onions didnt taste garlic or ginger commatoken and the curry was abundant commatoken but little flavor except salt periodtoken this dish fell flat   it was edible and okay commatoken but i would never order again commatoken and thats the reason for the two stars periodtoken when it comes to food i hold in high regard commatoken it needs to hit me in a sweet spot commatoken and this food did not periodtoken my biggest complaint besides overcooked and dry chicken is no lemongrass in lemongrass chicken i just do not understand commatoken when this was the daughter of whos famous in my book of the best of the best commatoken and i remember the delicious and unique flavor of the abundant lemon grass in the dish back in the mid 90s periodtoken also commatoken the portion was 12 size commatoken it wasnt a dinner portion it was like a lunch portion plus periodtoken last but not least the curry was super weak its kind you buy over the counter commatoken maybe dont seal after using maybe at the end of shift and after 23 months of this lack of respect commatoken its stale commatoken and you can taste salt only and just see the yellow of the curry commatoken and thats about it periodtoken   two more thoughts commatoken as i put much thought into my reviews and do not take giving out reviews lightly commatoken my coworker order the bbq pork and shrimp w noodles periodtoken they put 2 commatoken count 2 shrimp in her dish periodtoken she didnt volunteer the information commatoken but we were having a conversation commatoken and i was telling her i get scared to order shrimp most places because of the freshness commatoken etc periodtoken i then asked to see a shrimp in her dish commatoken to judge commatoken which she just started eating commatoken and she said commatoken i dont have anymore commatoken and i said commatoken why she said well there was only 2   last thought commatoken my coworker on this visit order spring rolls commatoken we had two commatoken not very large springs rolls for 6 periodtoken value sucked commatoken and i would never order these again   overall commatoken sf kitchen is a nice place in somewhat awkward neighborhood commatoken but its just not for me commatoken but it might fit for you","9898":"blakes aight burger periodtoken  bun was soggy and they forgot the dipping sauce for our chicken strips periodtoken i wonder is the staff there eats chicken strips with no sauce periodtoken i really doubt it periodtoken careless service especially for a new restaurant in town periodtoken","9899":"i found the place to be a bit noisy and the tables to close for my taste periodtoken as for the food  periodtoken periodtokeni ordered the monte cristo periodtoken i guess it was just ok periodtoken the potatoes where just flat out dry periodtoken i literally just picked at it periodtoken the menu description of food and sleek website had me expecting something more exciting and intimate than an ihop without booths periodtoken","9900":"the food and beer is excellent periodtoken we have been here at least a dozen times with our toddlers and have had no issues with bringing our toddlerfriendly foods in while we enjoy our meal periodtoken this time we were asked to either put our outside food away or leave because of a health code violation despite the numerous tables around us with kids eating their own food periodtoken next time if you are going to institute a policy that will undoubtedly steer families like us away commatoken the least you could do is be consistent with it periodtoken we were singled out periodtoken not a happy patron today periodtoken","9901":"its a whole foods periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken but what will keep me from shopping here is the incredibly offensive butcher behind glass and the hanging carcasses periodtoken  i truly can not imagine what might have motivated you to do this periodtoken i am not a vegan but you must have many who shop here periodtoken is this not going to turn them away i not a vegan but this is so horrible i can not shop here periodtoken again commatoken i cant understand how you came to this decision periodtoken","9902":"my disclaimer to soften the blow i am not a selfproclaimed foodie commatoken nor do i profess to know allthingsgoodbecauseifounditfirst periodtoken i do not buy local just because it is local commatoken yet i will stalk local purveyors because i honestly want them to succeed periodtoken the expectation for my 21 dozen strange donuts experience was to walk away saying dmn that was good commatoken promote it and offer repeat visits periodtoken at this point commatoken i am not able to commit to any of that periodtoken  i visited on a saturday morning around 11am periodtoken the small line of customers 10 moved quickly through the queue and the counter personnel were attentive periodtoken the display case was filled with many varieties periodtoken the types i bought were strawberry shortcake commatoken mexican chocolate commatoken oreo commatoken bacon commatoken and barts periodtoken not one was what i consider fresh periodtoken my wife and daughter both thought they might be leftovers from friday latenight periodtoken i think that was a good assessment of taste and texture because while they were not stale commatoken they surely were not fresh periodtoken  next commatoken simply grabbing stuff from the candy commatoken cookie and cereal aisle of a local grocer commatoken then crushing and dumping on a donut commatoken does not make it strange periodtoken granted commatoken there are not a lot of other places competing with the concept commatoken but a product needs to be sound at the base periodtoken plain yeast or cake donuts need to stand on their own periodtoken even though i did not have either basic type unadorned commatoken the toppings could not mask the inferior quality beneath periodtoken it is true that the crushed oreos did taste like oreos commatoken and the butterfinger crumbles did taste like butterfingers commatoken but i do not think this should be considered part of the quality of the product commatoken otherwise i would be reviewing nabisco or nestl\u00e9 periodtoken   there are some really good 2 and 3star yelp reviews here commatoken which are more than just bashing a small business or trying to thwart their success periodtoken i hope the strange donuts crew looks for a common theme periodtoken please regroup commatoken retool commatoken and i will then be willing to drop another 21 for a dozen donuts periodtoken","9903":"this is without doubt the one of the worst casinos i have been to periodtoken just to give you a brief background i frequent vegas and have seeked out casinos during my travels in europe periodtoken canada periodtoken america periodtoken this place is gross and the only reason i have gone a third time is because the cashier line from the second time was so long due to only two cashiers working at a prime friday night time periodtoken the only reason i went a second time was killing time before picking up family at an airport periodtoken  this is a heavily smoking casino periodtoken however the cleaning agents that they use will bother you more than the poorly ventilated smokey atmosphere periodtoken  their rewards program expires after three months of inactivity periodtoken  their table games have a very high minimum even during non peak hours and other tables empty periodtoken  their parking is a mess periodtoken however they are putting in a new garage periodtoken  slot odds are horrible periodtoken  there is no cohesion in what slots are where and how to find them periodtoken except of course the high limit periodtoken  having been to a few casinos well many i can determine this casino is catered towards the low income periodtoken this is sad periodtoken i am pro casino except when they run it this way periodtoken  my recommendation stay away and send a message periodtoken and by no means am i upset in losing money as it is such an unenjoyable experience ive never spent enough money to question my losses here periodtoken","9904":"hoping they close this joint so that something worthwhile can take its place periodtoken 10 gyros nothing special commatoken odd atmosphere commatoken its hot as hell inside commatoken and during my last visit commatoken there was rap music playing wish i had gone to subway next door and thats saying something periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9905":"great chowder and lobster roll periodtoken  however the mussels were very bad tasting periodtoken  at least you can buy seafood here so that makes up for it","9906":"just found out today they wont serve non fat milk what a shame i use to enjoy this place periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9907":"food good commatoken ate in  commatoken service more than poor commatoken ordered soup came out barely warm commatoken asked to have t warmed up commatoken waitress took it away  commatoken waited 15 min commatoken asked her about the soup commatoken oh i was busy commatoken by then rest of the meal out commatoken so cancelled the soup commatoken and the guy on the register trashed me out for saying take the soup off my bill periodtoken the good food not worth the surly service commatoken wont go back","9908":"ive never actually left a review on any place because it feels really mean but honestly im so poor and those 10 i spent were really a lot so i want to save everyone else from making the mistake i did periodtoken the name of the place is pho bistro commatoken dont get the damn pad thai periodtoken literally do not do it periodtoken the name is pho not thai food commatoken there unfortunately are very very limited options in the area so i was desperate but honestly just do not do it periodtoken i wanted authentic thai not made by a lady named sharon and periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit was honestly the most disappointing and depressing pad thai ive ever had periodtoken and i pretty much try to get pad thai wherever i go periodtoken it was literally bright orange noodles with zero flavor and i feel so mean saying that because i work in foodservice whatever starbucks for over a year and i get it commatoken i know sometimes shit happens and the service was honestly great super nice commatoken really friendly commatoken food came out fast periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenit just sucked  it was bright orange you guys what even is that commatoken the chicken was periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenweird and scary commatoken just had a bad taste commatoken it didnt taste like pad thai at all and im really bummed bc i cant even afford to be spending money like that and i shouldve just gone with their pho periodtoken ive had their pho before commatoken that shit was hella dank i recommend that 100 the place is great their pad thai just periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenim scarred tbh periodtoken shouldve known better than to go for thai at a place literally called pho bistro periodtoken excuse me while i cry over the 10 down the drain i couldnt finish it commatoken honestly it just wasnt pad thai the noodles literally looked like angel hair pasta im really upset and sad mostly sad because i feel like if i was a dish i would be that sad sorry excuse of pad thai anywho commatoken their pho is great and they give you a good amount too periodtoken dont get the pad thai though periodtoken ","9909":"one day their bakery was wonderful periodtoken  the next day we purchased 15 worth of products only to find they were old periodtoken  the next morning commatoken i returned to the market commatoken so i took my receipt and was treated pretty rudely periodtoken  it would have been easy to make me happy as they had done the first day i went there periodtoken  but the lady who said she was the manager was a real crumb","9910":"i stopped by commatoken we ate 3 donuts and some form of sausage in a bun periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthey asked if i wanted it in the microwave periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe horror  the place is straight out of the 1980s periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni wont be back periodtoken     saw some post claiming these are california doughnuts commatoken well just like the pizza commatoken you can keep them periodtoken","9911":"typical indian buffet commatoken but definitely on the high end of the scale periodtoken for a selfserve place the service is very good commatoken they bring out naan commatoken silverware commatoken and drinks periodtoken the food is all fresh commatoken warm and very good periodtoken the atmosphere is cozy commatoken its dimly lit with traditional indian decorations and soft indian music periodtoken 1010  edit i had tripped on my way to take a photo and was on the ground for a few seconds commatoken as i got to the buffet i felt something crawling on my elbow commatoken i slapped it and two bugs about stink bug sizebut with the body structure of a ladybug ran towards the the buffet and disappeared periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenliterally seconds after i posted my original review periodtoken i was in shock for several minutes but took the photo of the buffet nonetheless periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken 310 because the food was nice and the decor was good but bugs on the floor periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","9912":"we have been to many different cheddars restaurants over the years in many different locations periodtoken we love them because theyre always super fast commatoken cheap commatoken and delicious periodtoken today was our first time eating at the mount juliet location commatoken and i have to say we were not impressed periodtoken   when we checked in with the hostess she told us there was a 510 minute wait periodtoken 25 minutes later we get a table and the restaurant was full of empty tables  it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come to the table periodtoken we gave her our entire order at that time drinks commatoken food commatoken and appetizer periodtoken   while we were waiting a couple at a table beside us found a bug in their food periodtoken i heard them tell their waitress and the manager telling them that they spray for bugs all the time periodtoken   i think they were understaffed commatoken but that was the worst experience at cheddars we have had so far periodtoken i dont think well be back to this location periodtoken","9913":"after standing at the register waiting for what seemed like an eternity for someone to help me i finally placed my notrealdifficullt order for a medium latte with one pump of syrup periodtoken  oh periodtoken periodtoken periodtokeni forgot to mention that when i was waiting for what seemed like an eternity there were two people standing statuesquely behind the registers periodtoken  i kid you not periodtoken  it was almost like time stopped and we were all frozen for a few minutes periodtoken  awkward periodtoken  anyway commatoken same girl who took my order goes to make my drink and gets into an argument with another barista about resteaming the milk periodtoken  surprise commatoken surprise commatoken my lazy girl wanted to just reheat the stuff that had been sitting around which wouldve been okay with me had she at least made a bit of an attempt to top off with a gulp of fresh milk periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenas it were commatoken there was about an extra 1 12 inches of nothing at the top of my cup periodtoken    so commatoken she goes to squirt the syrup and squirts three times and then tries to argue with me that one shot is actually 3 pumps periodtoken  which is fine but i specifically said one pump periodtoken  she admitted that thats what i said but then proceeded to say again that three pumps equaled one pump periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennow thinking about math problems makes my palms sweat and im not that great at it but i do know that 1 does not equal 3 periodtoken  moron periodtoken  i forgive periodtoken  i forget periodtoken  but this is maybe the 5th time that something like this has happened at this location periodtoken  i wont be back periodtoken","9914":"filthy dirty restaurant the walls are covered with food and greasy handprints periodtoken understaffed periodtoken ok food periodtoken","9915":"tried wendys again this afternoon periodtoken  its winter commatoken its always freezing in there periodtoken  we asked for the heat to be turned up commatoken it wasnt commatoken we asked the guy to turn it up again and he said he told the manager and she said no periodtoken  we said wed talk to her boss and the guy said her boss was there as well and he didnt care either periodtoken  so i said id talk to corporate periodtoken  sent them an email when i got home and will follow up tomorrow with a phone call periodtoken  needless to say we wont be going back there periodtoken  tables are still being swiped with a dirty rag and are still dirty periodtoken","9916":"losing charm dirty premises commatoken inconsistent food commatoken depressing service   ill start with the hope for new life to breathe into this formerly charming neighborhood tent pole periodtoken im really rooting for them periodtoken   i have had lovely experiences here periodtoken i have had wonderful pies commatoken cakes commatoken milk shakes so lovely i am willing to brave the servers who sigh with disappointment at my apologetic face so sorry to bother you commatoken but i would like to buy a slice of your pie periodtoken  until i had one or two slices of of disenchanting desserts commatoken and then my bravery decreased periodtoken tonight might have been the last straw commatoken however periodtoken   time it was 9pm commatoken late for philadelphia on a sunday commatoken and we had a sweet tooth periodtoken   cleanliness the restaurant is usually casually shabby commatoken but tonights counters were covered with dirty towels commatoken sticky dishes commatoken and and melted lumps of cream commatoken front and back counters periodtoken   food the pie was a continuation of our downward experience burned in places and raw in others periodtoken what happened it used to be so good my hot chocolate was cold and more syrup than anything periodtoken   service the girl at the counter was her usual commatoken just barely tolerating a customer commatoken posture periodtoken  i found someone who told me in a friendly tone that she was the owner commatoken and i let her know about our experience being much lower than we expected periodtoken she explained the restaurant was out of the usual chocolate recipe commatoken but then asked commatoken have you had our pie before periodtoken im not sure what that had to do with the bad pie commatoken but she said she would check up on the matter periodtoken   she didnt really seem concerned periodtoken and thats perhaps my concern no one at more than ice cream appears concerned with keeping a clean place with consistently decent food commatoken and generally friendly service periodtoken   i hope this changes periodtoken","9917":"my family and i went to popeyes while stopping at the delaware welcome center travel plaza commatoken and this popeyes definitely is one of the worst ones that i have been too periodtoken even the popeyes in mall food courts are better periodtoken  this outlet didnt have all the sauces that popeyes normally has commatoken it just had boring ranch and buffalo sauce periodtoken the breading of the chicken strips was bad commatoken and continuously fell off periodtoken the food at a normal popeyes is definitely better periodtoken  pretty much all the restaurant options at the delaware welcome center travel plaza are bad commatoken so i wouldnt have high hopes for anything periodtoken","9918":"the food is good but the service is terrible commatoken  often they are out of main menu items periodtoken  there is better periodtoken","9919":"two stars because the service is nice commatoken friendly and fast periodtoken but the food what a disappointment periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken good fried chicken commatoken although nothing to write home about commatoken but fairly disappointing sides periodtoken i had the collard greens and they were actually gritty periodtoken like sand between my teeth and the fried green tomatoes one of my alltime southern favorites were also a waste of 6 small slices commatoken mostly end pieces commatoken batter slipping off periodtoken the only side i enjoyed quite a bit was the mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows  delicious periodtoken  overall commatoken though commatoken it was a pretty negative experience periodtoken we wont be returning for a while commatoken unless we hear that the kitchen has stepped it up periodtoken","9920":"after waiting for 30 minutes for my food none of which had to be cooked they proceeded to tell me that they ran out periodtoken they tried to give me a refund commatoken but nobody knew how to use the cash register commatoken which prompted everybody to start yelling at each other commatoken including at me periodtoken i had no idea what to order for that as practically everything else had run out periodtoken i ended up with a measly container of greens periodtoken hk nola really needs to work on their customer service periodtoken just because the main clientele is college students commatoken doesnt mean they deserve to be treated as less than periodtoken","9921":"my coworker and i were craving a strawberry smoothie and this place was literally 0 periodtoken02 miles away periodtoken we decided commatoken why not because sometimes orange julius smoothies can hit the spot periodtoken  no periodtoken no periodtoken no periodtoken  we were better off making a smoothie with our hands periodtoken the smoothie wasnt smooth at all seriously how the hell are you known for shakes and smoothies and im literally chewing on the smoothie big chucks of ice just ruining each attempt of a sip in your straw periodtoken","9922":"i came in here for a french macaroon and it just wasnt good at all periodtoken the macaroon was very hard on the outside and the inside was just like a empty pocket periodtoken i was very disappointed but the reason why i didnt give this place a one star is because the service was very good periodtoken the girl at the front counter was very nice periodtoken","9923":"okay but not great periodtoken  burgers were undersized and okay periodtoken fun experience but not a food hotspot periodtoken","9924":"good selection of products commatoken but way too crowded and expensive for my taste periodtoken  this is like the touristy place you always have to go to when you come into town commatoken but never really purchase anything substantial periodtoken  a cannoli commatoken maybe periodtoken  many people really love the place periodtoken","9925":"okay periodtoken nice atmosphere periodtoken food is tasty enough periodtoken staff is just pleasant enough periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken two out of three people in our party had to send back steaks for being over and under cooked periodtoken filet requested medium well came out medium both times periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand finally was just sent away periodtoken the waitress said to just order well done next time periodtoken really  yes commatoken she really did say that periodtoken  the second steak was a ribeye and  was requested medium periodtoken it came out close to well done the first time periodtoken the second time commatoken a new ribeye cane out much juicier commatoken but still on the very medium well side periodtoken the filet did get taken off the bill commatoken so that was good commatoken but the rest was not discounted  even after the manager saw it was still overcooked periodtoken    overall commatoken its okay commatoken but nothing to write home about periodtoken there are much better choices nearby periodtoken","9926":"i appreciate that theyre a familyowned commatoken local business periodtoken i really do periodtoken but the fact that theres a rouses nearby and a whole foods quite literally across the street means i dont have to travel much further for a wider selection or more competitive prices periodtoken    its directly on the metairie route for mardi grasirishitalian parades commatoken so if youre attending one of those and run out of drinkfoodstuffs breaux mart will be right there for you periodtoken","9927":"pretty much as expected periodtoken washington avenue commatoken dive corner bar atmosphere commatoken saturday nightsmokey commatoken crowded commatoken and loud periodtoken not really favorite type of venue commatoken but i was with a birthday party group commatoken most of whom were about half my age periodtoken i knew the job was dangerous when i took it periodtoken  service at the bar was very good commatoken which was pretty amazing considering the crowd around the bar was 23 deep periodtoken  buckets of long necks for 10 is a fair deal and watching games of giant jenga unfold as the participants get drunker can be amusing periodtoken am i likely to become a regular no periodtoken not a big fan of the having to take a shower at 130 a periodtokenm periodtoken because of thick second hand smoke periodtoken  as long as you know what youre getting into its an ok place periodtoken id maybe go as high as 2 periodtoken5 stars periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennaw commatoken make that 2 periodtoken25 periodtoken","9928":"i had high hopes for this place based on previous reviews but i was left disappointed periodtoken i ordered a passionfruit green tea with pearls and i have definitely had better periodtoken it was quite watery so the flavour just wasnt there periodtoken maybe they were having an off day","9929":"went to get fancy donuts and they did not have any fancy donuts available periodtoken only the fresh ones periodtoken the restaurant is called federal donuts periodtoken donuts should always be available periodtoken  p periodtokens periodtoken im only giving this two stars because they did not have any donuts periodtoken the hot fresh donuts with cinnamon or strawberry lavender are good commatoken but you cant just tell customers that you dont have any of the other products available periodtoken","9930":"so i have seen this place talked about in nashville scene commatoken on the food network and cooking channel commatoken so i figured it would be a great place to check out with a friend periodtoken i guess commatoken i should also include the disclaimer that i dont like pancakes or anything that you would put maple syrup on gasp periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken i know commatoken i am crazy periodtoken  i didnt mind the 3045 min wait outside as it was a beautiful day out commatoken but in the middle of summer or winter i highly doubt i would wait in the line periodtoken they do have water and coffee on a cart outside for the people waiting in line periodtoken  so the restaurant really has no ambiance periodtoken it is just a large plain room with lots of tables commatoken nothing special to write home about periodtoken i got the pantry breakfast wrap and it was pretty good and very reasonable periodtoken however commatoken i dont know if it was good enough for the 3045 min wait periodtoken my friend got the swiss chocolate chip pancakes and said they were great periodtoken  personally commatoken i just dont get the hype periodtoken but a girl who doesnt like pancakes probably wouldnt be a huge fan of the pancake pantry periodtoken","9931":"ive been here 2x commatoken once with a group and once for an anniversary dinner periodtoken the food was pretty good commatoken we mainly just wanted somewhere that was byo periodtoken the reason why i only give them 2 stars is because of the atrocious wait staff periodtoken the first time i was there we had such a hard time flagging down our waiter for anything but assumed it was because they were somewhat busy only about 60 full periodtoken the food also took forever the second time i went back with my boyfriend the food also took over 35 mins and it was a monday night periodtoken after we were finished eating i repeatedly asked for the dessert menu from 3 different waiters and yet none of them brought it finally after 25 mins of waiting for it  our waiter just brought us the check incredibly rude and inefficient periodtoken the food is good and the place looks cute commatoken but not worth it periodtoken","9932":"i went to that barbq place when it first opened and thought it was decent commatoken so decided to go there for lunch with a friend today to try it again periodtoken we met at 1130 so it was very quiet when i first got there commatoken but it did pick up later periodtoken  i ordered and by the time i had paid commatoken my food was ready on the counter periodtoken very fast periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken maybe too fast i ordered the brisket sandwich with beans and my friend got the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes periodtoken   the first bite was pretty disappointing periodtoken then bun was stale and tasted a few days old periodtoken the brisket was very dry and pretty flavourless periodtoken i was able to douse the meat in barbecue sauce commatoken so that kind of salvaged it commatoken but i prefer to have the meat stand alone commatoken not just be masqueraded in a sauce periodtoken there was no saving the stale bun though periodtoken  i had tried the pit beans the first time i was there and enjoyed the smoky taste and brisket mixed in periodtoken this time commatoken i could hardly distinguish them from beans straight out of a can periodtoken   my friend wasnt very fond of his pulled pork sandwich commatoken saying that it was very bland periodtoken  honestly commatoken the only saving grace of this place is the barbecue sauce periodtoken everything else was a big meh periodtoken ive had much better barbecue at chain restaurants than this specialty barbecue place periodtoken","9933":"oh commatoken bake 425 periodtoken so much unrealized potential periodtoken i have been here twice commatoken both with groupons periodtoken otherwise commatoken i wouldnt bother periodtoken it is a great concept local commatoken organic foods that should do well on the main line periodtoken however commatoken every time i walk by 425 commatoken it is empty periodtoken some suggestions  1 periodtoken take out the vintage oven and winslow cutout on the left when you enter and put in a couple of tables periodtoken the salads especially the cobb here are fantastic and dont require cooking commatoken so why not have a couple of tables eating in the car is a drag periodtoken   2 periodtoken im not really sure why you would advocate a bakeathome pizza place in a college town with a million other pizza places periodtoken many of the college kids dont have ovens commatoken and they have money or their parents commatoken via wildcat cards periodtoken  as my husband says commatoken i dont know why youd want to spend 20 on a pizza that you have to cook at home periodtoken i guess the ingredients commatoken but i dont really want to spend that price to have to do the leg work myself periodtoken lazy commatoken maybe commatoken but ive heard many others say the same thing periodtoken   3 periodtoken i would bake a few pies and sell by the slice at the store periodtoken this would entice people to come during lunch and encourage them to buy the pies to eat at home periodtoken same thing with the cookies periodtoken  with a few changes commatoken i think this place could really thrive on the main line periodtoken however commatoken i am puzzled by their current business approach periodtoken since 425 is owned by the same people as peace a pizza meh commatoken i am surprised that they dont have a similar dinein or carryout option as the store further west on lancaster periodtoken if they dont change commatoken i dont expect to see 425 survive the next year commatoken which is a shame periodtoken","9934":"i went in for crawfish commatoken potatoes and corn periodtoken  i asked the cashier were they hot because they were sitting behind her as she was putting them in the bag commatoken she said there warm commatoken we cooked them today periodtoken everything was cold periodtoken the corn was dried out and potatoes were cold periodtoken nothing was seasoned periodtoken i understand its not crawfish season but that was awful if they werent go an steam them per request they shouldnt sell cold and old periodtoken","9935":"pour house is like a frat house complete with that silly bean bag game commatoken shuffle board and giant jenga

and square shaped and the tortillas get soggy real quick periodtoken   maybe ill try the burger next or possibly scope it out for cocktails at happy hour commatoken but this is one food truck that should have been left out of the rotation periodtoken","9984":"not impressed periodtoken i ordered 4 different tacos and they were average to below average periodtoken they have some unique combinations but thats about it periodtoken margarita was pretty good periodtoken","9985":"this place is confounding to me  so am going with hit or miss yet feeling slightly bad about that periodtoken   first commatoken it is uncomfortably loud because they put the music up high and then people talk louder to make up for it periodtoken i think that surprised me because its so cute inside i expected so much better given the look and feel that they would opt for this periodtoken   the drinks were okay  the old fashioned was nice commatoken but the january special had way too much crushed ice and looked like a beach drink periodtoken yes commatoken in january  the last thing i want in 20 degree weather is an icy drink periodtoken   service was nice periodtoken she was frustrated with us understandably because my friend could not decide what to order but attentive and helpful periodtoken   appetizer squid was fantastic  i would definitely order it again because the celery root and almonds were so tasty periodtoken my entree risotto was terrible though periodtoken the rice was not cooked long enough i dont want it mushy commatoken but it should not be crunchy and the oysters tasted wrong periodtoken the whole thing was cold periodtoken i kind of want my 22 back   overall commatoken it is definitely not worth the price periodtoken if i went back it would be for a drink and an appetizer at the bar periodtoken","9986":"ok bubble tea but only limited variety periodtoken i have had a few bad bubbles in the past periodtoken  what is most disappointing is the frozen yogurt periodtoken  all super sweet varieties periodtoken even ice cream isnt usually this sweet periodtoken  expect the common flavors of cake batter commatoken red velvet cake and cookies and cream periodtoken  this place is way better for kids than adults periodtoken  there are too few frozen yogurt places in town that have the nice clean flavors that should differentiate yogurt from ice cream periodtoken  they have an ok mix of toppings periodtoken","9987":"went for dinner on a saturday night and ordered their standard burger the american medium rare periodtoken i ended up being served a dry commatoken extremely overcooked meatball sized piece of meat periodtoken the fries were fine commatoken the milkshake was good periodtoken but if you want an actual hamburger commatoken i suggest going somewhere else periodtoken","9988":"got in there at 745 periodtoken wait for 15 minute to order 5 people ahead of me and 823 the order is ready periodtoken staff is loud to each other and yell back and forth for communication and i heard they call each other bixch periodtoken eyeroll to customer periodtoken  no table is clean periodtoken the star is for the food commatoken better than the mcdonald in kingshighway and jefferson  periodtoken","9989":"this use to be my favorite restaurant periodtoken the food was great periodtoken i have noticed it has hasnt been the same anymore periodtoken i went here for my birthday and had the worst experience periodtoken i think they had a new waitress and the restaurant was pretty empty so i still do not get why we had so many issues periodtoken first  they never brought us bread and we ordered 2 dinners periodtoken they brought our food out after 30 minutes and then brought the soup and salad out periodtoken when we said we didnt want it because we already had our food they could of cared less periodtoken we spoke with a young manager that i had never seen there before and all he offered was to pack the soup and salad so we can bring it home periodtoken no apologizes he was more interested in hanging out with staff periodtoken a real disappointment periodtoken we use to frequent cd 3 or more times a month when we had guest from out of town we always brought them here periodtoken too bad it has changed so much periodtoken","9990":"horrible clam chowder expansive for the quality and amount of food they serve periodtoken would not recommend periodtoken","9991":"had a poor first experience commatoken which is unfortunate because i think the burger had a lot of great flavor and quality ingredients periodtoken service was the main opportunity for improvement periodtoken i was the only one in the drive thru with over 8 employees and it took several minutes for someone to come to the window periodtoken no greeting and filled the wrong soda periodtoken   meat tasted great and veggies were fresh periodtoken the chillies are tasty hot periodtoken i personally would like to see more of them since they are big part of what makes this brand unique periodtoken","9992":"the sweet potato hash and kombucha were good periodtoken but commatoken i was disgusted when i used their restroom periodtoken it was dirty and there were flies all over periodtoken","9993":"took 15 minutes to get our order periodtoken then mine wasnt the right sand which periodtoken the food was just ok periodtoken nice atmosphere commatoken but we wont be back periodtoken","9994":"i went here to have a fun dinner over the holidays with my siblings periodtoken the place was full commatoken but didnt look too busy periodtoken it took the waitress about 10 minutes to come to our table and take a drink order commatoken and over the course of the evening commatoken she generally seemed either disinterested or just generally annoyed to be a server periodtoken i think her name was alissa commatoken or melissa commatoken was incredibly slow and walked past our table filled with empty app plates repeatedly without clearing them periodtoken when our main entrees finally arrived commatoken she pushed our app plates to the center of the table to make room for our entrees periodtoken i handed her my plate and asked her to take these away periodtoken my dinner was the special commatoken but it was pretty much just a burrito packed with rice and a few pieces of chicken commatoken it sucked periodtoken everyone else liked their food periodtoken my brother ordered a beer and she said commatoken ok and walked away periodtoken he had to call her back to ask commatoken what beers do you have on tap do you have xyz beer  when we asked for dessert menus and we were given 1 commatoken though there were 5 of us at the table periodtoken id say that was lazy commatoken but carrying 5 menus doesnt seem like anymore work than carrying 1 periodtoken in summary  service sucked commatoken food was okay periodtoken","9995":"la colombes coffee is quite tastey but their service is seriously lacking periodtoken the iced latte i ordered was very good  i didnt even need to put sugar in it periodtoken unfortunately commatoken the barista who made and served me my drink was anything but sweet periodtoken she was impatient and rather rude especially when i wanted to pay using my debit card periodtoken i did tip her in cash so i dont understand what the ice queen treatment was for to top if off commatoken she proceeded to be personable to the next guy in line who ended up not leaving her a tip periodtoken talk about biting the hand that feeds you periodtoken","9996":"really good service periodtoken very friendly clean environment periodtoken i ordered spring rolls and iced green tea periodtoken the spring rolls were good periodtoken i especially liked the mint in it periodtoken the iced green tea periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken thats a different story periodtoken horrible this drink is beyond a reasonable doubt commatoken spoiled periodtoken i cant get the taste out of my mouth periodtoken i didnt tell the owners anything because i hate making a scene and i always have the thought of what if they spit in my new drink thought periodtoken pretty disappointing to say the least periodtoken","9997":"gosh commatoken i really wanted to love this place periodtoken i support privately owned coffee shops over the starbuckstype conglomerates any day periodtoken   i was excited to try buddy brew commatoken but we were disappointed in the product periodtoken however commatoken the stores atmosphere is beautiful periodtoken   we just came in for cold brew iced coffees periodtoken i had vanilla added to mine periodtoken they tasted very burnt and i couldnt finish mine periodtoken also commatoken i could not taste any vanilla periodtoken the options for milk were only skim or half  half and the sugar bar had raw sugar commatoken splenda commatoken etc periodtoken i like the raw sugar commatoken but not the crystal form periodtoken who wants crunchy sugar in their coffee they should have the liquid form available and there should be more options for milk  almond commatoken coconut commatoken soy commatoken etc periodtoken maybe they have it if you ask commatoken but i didnt see it on the menu periodtoken   the shop is very clean and modern periodtoken it looks like a nice place to hang out commatoken but they need to up their game for a specialized coffee shop periodtoken id like to see different brews of coffee offered commatoken brewed flavors commatoken more options for sweetener commatoken etc periodtoken","9998":"prices are high for mediocre food periodtoken very disappointed in meal periodtoken","9999":"the clams were stringy commatoken not sure where their from periodtoken the lobster was did not have much flavor or texture commatoken again not sure where this food is from periodtoken dont think it was from new england for sure periodtoken the food is fair commatoken not great or
