very excited to see this one which is closer to my house periodtoken the vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area periodtoken you order at the counter and they deliver it periodtoken my daughter and i tried the sushi bowl periodtoken you pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins commatoken vegetables commatoken rice and toppings periodtoken i like the fact that it is on paper and you dont have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want periodtoken the sushi bowl was good but not wonderful periodtoken the choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and i felt i had more rice than other food items periodtoken the sauces were tasty periodtoken my husband ordered the maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard periodtoken it was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street periodtoken i would go back though and i think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls periodtoken i do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service periodtoken people  it is a sushi place  it isnt mcdonalds so it will be a bit slower periodtoken you are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express periodtoken as a healthy alternative to fast food in the area commatoken it is worth the wait periodtoken oh and try the bubble tea periodtoken i had the strawberry and it was quite yummy periodtoken next time i am going to try the vanilla chai periodtoken","8":"after my rotd  yesterday of a different sweet ceces location commatoken i realized

and it did not disappoint since this place just opened yesterday commatoken im not exactly sure if its replacing the other red kings down the street commatoken or if it is just a second helping of spicy commatoken szechuan food periodtoken  we ordered takeout and picked up the dan dan noodles and a shredded pork in garlic sauce dish periodtoken the spice level in both dishes was perfect periodtoken  extremely mouthburning commatoken but with delicious flavors that were sweet commatoken earthy commatoken and fresh periodtoken the portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us periodtoken i cant wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sitdown dinner periodtoken they also have karaoke rooms upstairs commatoken plus they are byob

was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess commatoken labeled cake scrapple i was intrigued periodtoken they were different kinds of cakes and icings commatoken most likely left over from a bake periodtoken there were about 5 different flavors to choose from and i went with my favorite red velvet with cream cheese frosting periodtoken i also ended up with an mm cookie commatoken my other fave it was a nice day so i sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness the cookie was great commatoken soft  chewy with those hard candies for texture periodtoken the cake was also delicious and moist","48":"underrated burger alert  randomly came into pags during a stroll around doylestown periodtoken the menu wasnt super appealing commatoken actually commatoken so i just went with a cheeseburger periodtoken legitimately commatoken one of the best cheeseburgers ive had in a while tasted like a quality big mac patty wasnt too thick commatoken bun didnt overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used  yum periodtoken  we were in the wine bar section  ambiance is really nice def not very kid friendly we had our son with us periodtoken but staff was friendly and accommodating periodtoken  we will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger","51":"this is a convenience store deli commatoken so dont expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service thats the only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 periodtoken ive had a cuban press one time commatoken and a breakfast sandwich at another time periodtoken sandwiches are prepared upon

thing periodtoken    the egg sandwich was fantastic periodtoken  i was nervous when they said they didnt have kaiser rolls so i went with a hamburger roll periodtoken  it was an excellent decision periodtoken  the roll was excellent  not just an average cheap hamburger roll periodtoken  they layered the cheese on the sandwich commatoken which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich periodtoken  it was served with home fries commatoken which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions periodtoken  im not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan commatoken but these were great and i appreciated that they didnt clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of precooked home fries periodtoken  the pancakes were great and fluffy periodtoken  my one gripe was their use of smuckers prepackaged syrup periodtoken  i realize that if they put syrup in a container commatoken it probably wouldnt be real maple syrup commatoken but i sort of wish i didnt know that they were giving me subpar syrup periodtoken  the server was friendly and very attentive periodtoken  the coffee refills were constant commatoken and the coffee was actually good so many diners fail at coffee periodtoken

commatoken chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately periodtoken now let me get to the best partthe made to order commatoken chunky guacamole periodtoken the

anything but commatoken though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons periodtoken while i had a great eating experience commatoken my boyfriend did not periodtoken he said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless periodtoken he did say he would give it another shot though","133":"i love the concept of this place periodtoken one half of it a caf\u00e9 that

one is how much everything costs commatoken it is worth it but i still feel like the only reason why i dont order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around 30 for one pizza periodtoken my

large amounts of seating inside including both tables and comfier options including leather chairs and sofas periodtoken the outside seating is nice commatoken but the ambiance is disrupted by large amount of traffic on hazel dell and 116th periodtoken  the staff is generally really friendly and the service is quick periodtoken this place is crazy on the weekends commatoken with 10 cars waiting for the drive through commatoken so i would definitely park and stand in the line inside its generally a shorter wait periodtoken  as starbucks go commatoken this is a good one periodtoken","1416":"i

pleasure of tasting periodtoken  it was so rich in flavor and color periodtoken i enjoyed it with the warm pita periodtoken  next was my chicken kabob sandwich which was nice hearty chunks of grilled

clean and i can not wait to try more menu items periodtoken","1421":"the fried chicken is really good here periodtoken i know that sounds weird that a donut place has fried chicken but not to people that live in philly and know about federal donuts periodtoken the location in nolibs is on a sketchy street with nothing else around it periodtoken the donuts are really good too but the fried chicken is the star here periodtoken","1424":"been here a few times since my gf and i live by and like the outdoor seating area periodtoken the regular menu has always been pretty consistent with their fish  chips and old charlestown shrimp periodtoken appetizers are a bit expensive for what you get but they are good periodtoken the staff has always been nice and offer to bring out water for our dog when bring him so thats huge for us periodtoken   we finally realized they had a happy hour and walked away with mixed results periodtoken the menu has a good selection between food and drinks at different prices periodtoken we had a few food items including the baja tacos commatoken nachos and calamari periodtoken the one baja taco for 5 commatoken reg 7 periodtoken50 was good but for 5 i personally hoped for more than one or for something special with the tortilla periodtoken the fish itself was pretty damn good but the tortilla tasted fresh from the supermarket periodtoken having been spoiled by fresh tortillas elsewhere this was disappointing periodtoken the nachos plate was packed but the plate was small so all the cheese and few beans were on top with nothing on the chips hidden below periodtoken but the calamari was very good and came with a good amount periodtoken   i would stick with the regular menu or if happy hour has to be tried stick with the drinks and calamari periodtoken","1428":"well commatoken i cant lie commatoken they were definitely goodi got the bacon  eggs 3 pancakes commatoken bacon commatoken and 3 eggs which were great periodtoken my bf got the

like grits while everything was good commatoken and i would surely go back and try other things commatoken i think a lot of it is hype commatoken its good commatoken but people make it sound glorious and orgasmic periodtoken ive had better pancakes that just melted in my mouth literally elsewhere periodtoken but for the overall experience commatoken id say its good commatoken but its not the hype people make it to be commatoken but id def go back  p periodtokens periodtoken we saw reese witherspoon there","1433":"this place is very crowded periodtoken  the prices are reasonable periodtoken  we

combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect periodtoken  i loved it periodtoken  it did not need anything else periodtoken  i did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries separate purchase and it was pretty good commatoken but not necessary periodtoken  burgers were a pretty good size  they were smaller than the bun commatoken but still a good size periodtoken  worth the price  sure commatoken this was a quality burger  my only gripe commatoken however is that the price did not include fries see below periodtoken  no one left a morsel on their plates periodtoken  my sons friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenno one should eat that fast periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  sides  we ordered two large french fries 4 each to share between four people and it was exactly enough periodtoken  you have a choice of sauces periodtoken   i was not impressed at all  they were just fries commatoken and honestly with burgers starting at about 8 these fries should come with the burgers periodtoken  i need to have french fries with my burger commatoken so i will pay every time commatoken but suggest that they rethink this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries periodtoken  these are not worth the extra 24 periodtoken  we also had the cheese curds  ok not what i was expecting but it was good periodtoken  not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples  the breadcrackers however were a nightmare almost funny  they crumbled because they were so thin  almost like lace periodtoken  they really should be a little thicker periodtoken  again commatoken it was good commatoken but cmon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the breadcracker periodtoken    the boys had ice cream commatoken but i wont comment because i did not taste it periodtoken  i was too full from the burger periodtoken  hope to on the next trip periodtoken    overall commatoken we had a great time periodtoken  service was stellar commatoken the place itself is very cute commatoken but i can

recommend with the warning that it is pricy compared to other sushi restaurants periodtoken","1463":"very convenient for some craving or emergency cooking needs periodtoken  their prices are higher but they try to carry more specialty items periodtoken i have never noticed this but ive heard from others in my building to always ask for a receipt just in case the charge comes over wrong periodtoken  i highly recommend checking this place out to find new and exotic choices you wouldnt usually see or think to buy periodtoken  the fact that it is in downtown is one of the most appealing aspects to this place","1466":"went there for their anniversary event periodtoken they have a pool table and some arcade games periodtoken all their beers are on tap and for sale periodtoken great

warned about the kinks and yes they have them periodtoken  they only had one fry cook and heshe was overwhelmed to say the least periodtoken  the place was not crowded but with the variety on the menu would be daunting for one person periodtoken  we managed to spend 91 periodtoken  dont know how things that cost 2 to 7 works out to that much but it did periodtoken  i had a california roll commatoken chicken on a stick one with sauce and one with salt and pepper also had a beef stick and pork belly with asparagus wow was that good periodtoken  with a chaser of calamari periodtoken  sounds like a lot of food but the meat on a stick is one bite per person periodtoken   my best dish of the night was the beef on a stick periodtoken  tender moist with a slight chewiness that was perfect periodtoken  it was fantastic periodtoken  wife had the shrimp tempura and it looked great and she said it was good periodtoken  so super slow food coming out of the kitchen knocked the review

reasonable for what you get periodtoken coffee was very good  and refills on the house periodtoken it was a little loud with all the tables and counter seats full  kind of made it hard to hold a

 the last time we were there commatoken my boyfriend got the kobe beef burger commatoken thick cut applewood smoked bacon commatoken a fried egg and vermont cheddar cheese periodtoken he was knocked to the floor commatoken and has been telling everyone about it ever since periodtoken i got a simple beef patty with cheese and bbq sauce periodtoken maybe i need to be a bit more adventurous next time nonetheless commatoken i still loved my burger periodtoken  another great thing about 500 degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil periodtoken its just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy french fries periodtoken   ive always had stellar service here periodtoken i loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what i wanted off of the menu periodtoken i blame it on the rain brain periodtoken  my only gripe about 500 degrees is that it can get a little pricey periodtoken for burgers commatoken fries and drinks for 2 commatoken we paid about 28 periodtoken that included one kobe beef patty commatoken but even without it commatoken youre going to pay a sitdown price for what is really a takeout burger periodtoken the quality justifies this in many ways commatoken so well definitely be back periodtoken save your pennies and splurge","1487":"nice that says it finest greek food and service periodtoken all around you is a family atmosphere commatoken greek style you can make a meal on the appetizers alone periodtoken  my suggestions are as follows  1 kria piklilla  cold sampler platter  15 periodtoken95 can feed a family of at least 6  2 grilled vegetable sampler 8 periodtoken95  each of these will fill you up periodtoken thats a family of 6 im talking about  my friend nicki suggested i try saghanaki greek cheese pan fried then flambeed with a shot of ouzo she was right awesome periodtoken  my son ordered the vegetarian gyro he loved it i topped it all off with a traditional greek pound cake soaked with orange liquor delicious  probably the best part of this restaurant commatoken is the fact my son strict vegetarian commatoken  and i meat  fish eater commatoken  can both enjoy dozens of choices from both menus periodtoken thats rare in a restaurant periodtoken its usually meatfish oriented commatoken with one or two non meat choices periodtoken   great time commatoken great service periodtoken i suggest reservations","1489":"great gelateria on

periodtoken the pistachio commatoken raspberry commatoken and lemon are also pretty darn good periodtoken  they set up with their gelato cart at tower grove farmers market saturday mornings periodtoken i am pretty sure that gelato is an acceptable breakfast food commatoken especially on a hot summer day periodtoken  also commatoken they have cheerwine and sun drop commatoken which ive never seen outside of the carolinas","1496":"was recommended by a friend to try out this place when visitng santa barbara periodtoken the wait was worth it periodtoken everything they had was live

but they only do those for groups of 6 or more periodtoken being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes periodtoken we chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait periodtoken i had the cocktail featuring egg whites commatoken and it was very very tasty compares well to some similar cocktails ive had at thunderbird periodtoken once we finally were seated the food was all delicious periodtoken the crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing commatoken and reminded me of the flavor of bugles periodtoken the skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that commatoken so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops periodtoken  the food and drinks were awesome commatoken and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by periodtoken  final note if you do sit at the upstairs bar next to a door commatoken be forewarned that the door will bump you repeatedly as management and staff access the closet during the night periodtoken it becomes more annoying the longer you sit there because its unavoidable and a terrible design flaw periodtoken","1518":"cool joint super friendly staff that is more than happy to let you sample everything before you buy periodtoken its like a free flight","1522":"baileys range has interesting burgers for any type of person periodtoken all the food is good and so are the drinks and milkshakes the service at

very hard to decide what to get commatoken cause everything looked great   the server was very friendly commatoken prompt commatoken and attentive periodtoken   the food tasted fantastic commatoken and was cooked just as we ordered it periodtoken the two reasons i didnt give five stars   first  the burgers were a little smallish for their price periodtoken  if im paying 10 for a burger commatoken i want something substantial commatoken and i found the amount of meat a little lacking periodtoken second  while i realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people cause the place was pretty crowded commatoken it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready and commatoken while i understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken bottom line is i think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal commatoken and burgers should be a little quicker than that periodtoken","1533":"really liked the interior set up and d\u00e9cor periodtoken tall private booths commatoken with a sports and breakfast food theme commatoken very clean periodtoken i got the

authentic mexican food commatoken this is by far the most upscale ive seen periodtoken  im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type commatoken so this was different than what im used to periodtoken   the atmosphere at besito is tough to beat periodtoken they have merengue  salsa on the background which doesnt really go with the mexican theme but whos paying attention periodtoken an ideal date night atmosphere for sure periodtoken   food was very good but i must say a bit on the pricey side commatoken you have to consider the fact that you are paying for more than a meal

francis commatoken a super sweet lady who takes pride in keeping a very clean restaurant periodtoken it has more the feel of an intimate little restaurant than a fast food chain periodtoken when i feel like opa i head to wem periodtoken their pita bread is so yummy and fresh and their tzatziki is to die for periodtoken","1550":"there is real quality  there periodtoken the caveat commatoken they use a lot of canola oil which no 1st  class bakery would periodtoken but on the other hand they will make with real butter and do if you call ahead and those products are very fine

venue commatoken i have seen many first dates here periodtoken the music can be rather intrusive commatoken however commatoken the second floor provides a decent sanctuary for studying periodtoken

by the weight periodtoken just ask commatoken and they are glad to pull out tiny shot cups for you to sample flavors periodtoken could use tiny wood or plastic spoons commatoken or you need a very long tongue commatoken to get the full taste of the samples periodtoken they provide larger commatoken plastic teaspoons with your purchase periodtoken   on our opening day visit the flavors included

throughout periodtoken   as i watched each person come through the line and make their own little bit of a mess  as folks do  i also saw the staff right behind them straightening and cleaning things up so each customer gets a fresh berry sweet experience periodtoken   main criticisms are few but essential they must add napkins if they were available commatoken they were completely hidden and not offered at checkout even commatoken add an easily accessible posting of nutritional information especially being near whole foods commatoken people are allergy and diet conscious commatoken and a water cooler with small cups would be a welcome addition periodtoken add a recycling bin next to the trash bin for plastic spoons commatoken or use wooden spoons periodtoken   best of luck to this lovely little yogurt oasis periodtoken for now commatoken open til 11pm periodtoken perfect periodtoken","1610":"this is the best pasta house location ive been to in st periodtoken louis periodtoken

dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them we tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming periodtoken you could not taste the yummy commatoken meaty commatoken grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos periodtoken my husband loved the shredded pork tacos and i thought they were ok periodtoken the shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh commatoken crisp and light periodtoken i suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually

reno 3 years ago periodtoken as far as im concerned its the only supermarket chain in town periodtoken  like one other reviewer said i do stop at trader joes  when i go do a major shopping trip because of their somewhat different produce selections and their wonderful whole wheat bread offerings periodtoken    i use a lot of nuts to try to stay healthy and i love the bulk department for those because i can buy them in large or small quantities at a low price periodtoken i also use many other products from this department whole wheat pasta commatoken dry beans and veggies commatoken chips and the wonderful no sugar chocolates periodtoken  it was interesting when the store recently opened a fresh sushi bar periodtoken i commatoken like many others commatoken was very happy to see it periodtoken   i dinged them one star because of the fact that if you are there at a busy evening you might find little kids running up and down the isles and playing nerf football in the open areas periodtoken  parents from this part of town who are doing their shopping should keep their children with them and under control periodtoken  i actually prefer shopping at winco south as that problem

periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken crowds vary by the time and day you go commatoken but quiet or crowded commatoken its an interesting bistro type place periodtoken you cant miss with this spot as a date night locale  always delicious commatoken and cozy periodtoken the menu has changed very little over time commatoken and its not overly extensive commatoken but they often have a new special dessert or special of the day periodtoken be warned as their favorites do run out commatoken so the later in the day you go commatoken items may not be available periodtoken their carrot cake is pretty good commatoken moist and not too sweet periodtoken located close to local schools and webster university commatoken this is often a place to go to escape those regular establishments periodtoken asianladylikes","1972":"this is authentic chinese periodtoken  at first i was taken aback when the hostess tried successfully to talk me out of american chinese dishes and try something

the waitress recommended the local lobster and it was delicious great atmosphere looking out over the water periodtoken","1982":"one of my favorite spots for coffee and donuts in nola parking space available if youre driving periodtoken  very friendly staff periodtoken quick service periodtoken  one caveat the backyard space is a great addition but they keep the trash close to that area and it

to commatoken this has been the most clean thus far periodtoken quiet commatoken well decorated  friendly staff that im not accustomed to from the pho places in san francisco this restaurant surely deserves the rate that it has periodtoken","1996":"fresh grouper is amazing here periodtoken prepared anyway you want it periodtoken  family tried 5 different meals and they were all great periodtoken

and knowledgeable about the menu periodtoken   i ordered a u pick 2 soup and sandwich periodtoken  dill pickle potato soup commatoken which was exactly like it sounds periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokendelicious  and the blackhawk sandwich came on a soft fluffy vienna roll with rare roast beef commatoken roasted red pepper commatoken lettuce commatoken tomato commatoken and a goat cheese spread periodtoken  i could have used a touch more of the goat cheese commatoken but commatoken for less than 8 commatoken it was a great lunch periodtoken  oh commatoken yeah periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthere was a side of billy goat chips too    the reason i didnt give the fountain a 5 star rating was my dessert periodtoken  i ordered the johnny rabbit monkey malt a chocolate malt blended with bananas periodtoken  i am a malted freak commatoken and was  a little disappointed when it came out periodtoken periodtoken periodtokennot very thick commatoken and not very malty periodtoken  i figured out why when i got to the bottom of the metal shaker cup and all the malt powder was stuck to the bottom of the cup periodtoken  next time ill stick with a sundae periodtoken  and there will be a next time periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtokensoon periodtoken","2000":"i ordered the humus and falafels and was good periodtoken the falafels were one

through the cold and snow commatoken all the way out to st charles commatoken with our friends the ds to try hendricks bbq periodtoken  we found a warm bustling place with a nice saturday night feel and some decent barbecue periodtoken  hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect both st louis style and back ribs commatoken pulled pork commatoken brisket commatoken turkey and sausage what no goat oh well periodtoken  hendricks has a seriously large menu commatoken obviously centered around barbecue commatoken but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat periodtoken  we had a great waiter commatoken aaron periodtoken  he was well informed  i was impressed that he actually knew the definition of st louis style spare ribs and when we each ordered a pick 2 platter commatoken he informed us that each couple could split the whole shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price commatoken so that is what we did periodtoken  apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce commatoken which meats with my approval periodtoken  there are four sauces on the table periodtoken  each of these trays of meat comes with four sides so ms t and i had two slaws commatoken greens and sweet potato fries periodtoken  the ds added cheddar grits commatoken sweet potato casserole commatoken green beans and baked beans periodtoken  so here we go from first to worst periodtoken  hendricks makes good ribs periodtoken  both the st louis style and the back ribs were smoky commatoken moist commatoken tender and nicely seasoned with rub periodtoken  the rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness periodtoken  if it were overapplied commatoken it would be too sweet commatoken but it was in the proper proportion periodtoken  i would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other periodtoken  next for me was the pulled pork periodtoken  i am not a fan of pulled pork in missouri periodtoken  often it is in large hunks and dry periodtoken  this was pulled to bite size and was moist commatoken but not wet periodtoken  i would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs periodtoken  the brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods periodtoken  it had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor periodtoken  it was nice and tender commatoken but was on the edge of dry periodtoken  this would also make a good sandwich commatoken but might require some mayo to lube it up periodtoken  i know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket periodtoken  this is also worth ordering but at least this one night commatoken was not quite as good as pm in chesterfield  valley periodtoken  still pretty good for missouri periodtoken  turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and i would not reorder them periodtoken  turkey is always a real gamble periodtoken  if it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced commatoken before any juices run out commatoken it can be magnificent commatoken as we experienced at blacks barbecue in texas periodtoken  this had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry periodtoken  it was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible periodtoken  i just would not order it again commatoken though on another night it might be fine periodtoken    the sausage was commatoken hmmmm periodtoken  i almost liked it periodtoken  it was not like hillshire farms a point in its favor periodtoken  it had some nice heat commatoken ms t and the ds found it too spicy but it is not really periodtoken  i like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in texas periodtoken  they can be sensational periodtoken  my issue with this was that it tasted like pine sol periodtoken  this is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor periodtoken  is it juniper berries  a1 steak sauce kind of has the pine sol thing going commatoken maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix periodtoken  whatever commatoken all i can think of is the power of pine sol commatoken baby when eating it periodtoken  ill pass on that next time periodtoken  sides  ms d declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can periodtoken  try some at alcenias in memphis they loved the sweet potato casserole commatoken likening it to dessert periodtoken  they liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans periodtoken  i did not sample them periodtoken  aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion periodtoken    the only think aaron was not accurate on was the slaw periodtoken  he thought it had no onion commatoken but that was all i could taste periodtoken  this is very finely ground not shredded slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in carolina periodtoken  it is unique commatoken but inedible periodtoken  this was one of those rare times when we left the slaw periodtoken  it is unspeakably bad periodtoken  the sweet potato fries were fine periodtoken  the collard greens with bacon were good periodtoken  they were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat periodtoken  i enjoyed them periodtoken  there are even more sides to try periodtoken  hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night periodtoken  i think we need to meet our st charles friends commatoken the ls there periodtoken  so go commatoken have some ribs commatoken maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich periodtoken  you will want to bring your own slaw periodtoken  im going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs periodtoken","2004":"i cant speak for anything other than breakfast but ive always enjoyed that from this place periodtoken i always end up getting an omelette since it comes with home fries commatoken coffee and a juice periodtoken this tops most places that dont even include any of that periodtoken   like others ensure they take your order correctly periodtoken i once ordered a spanish omelette and ended up with a spinach omelette with feta periodtoken it was still really good  so i didnt complain but it was definitely not what i ordered periodtoken   the delivery guy is always nice and courteous and i have no complaints there at all periodtoken i will keep coming here since i know the food and pricing includes a good amount of stuff periodtoken","2009":"we got the grilled 3 cheese sandwich and the beef barley soup periodtoken they were unreal the only issue was the price

a better quality product than frost periodtoken if you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at allegro commatoken it will lose periodtoken but frosts strength is the variety  many more flavors than allegro periodtoken and the gelato here is still quite good  a solid 4 stars periodtoken but i wouldnt take an italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato periodtoken   frost also benefits from its location  next door to two very popular restaurants  sauce pizza and wine commatoken and wildflower periodtoken its a great spot for some light dessert after a meal

commatoken ready to bake pizzas for 5 not frozen commatoken special items in the cheese case and some pretty good coffee for 4 periodtoken  the lines look long commatoken but they really move pretty

as i would have liked and it was a touch salty commatoken but overall i liked it periodtoken the broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients  still bright green and just a touch of crunch periodtoken the roast chicken was really popular  i dont know if it was legs only but i snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks  skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some

silverware commatoken i think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level    we got there shortly after the range opened commatoken so seating was not a problem periodtoken  our server took our drink orders periodtoken  she had a dark beer commatoken and i had the sweet sweet bacon  a milkshake with makers mark commatoken candied bacon commatoken and salted caramel ice cream

periodtokenis this my burger  i didnt really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms commatoken though it looked like it might have been on there periodtoken  the cheese enveloped my burger commatoken so it was hard to tell whether i had the right burger periodtoken  but i pressed on anyway commatoken because i was hungry periodtoken  we also ordered a large order of fries commatoken and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce periodtoken  the fries were great commatoken and the homemade sauces were divine periodtoken  overall commatoken this was a good experience periodtoken  in hindsight commatoken i should have said something to our server regarding my burger commatoken but i chose not to periodtoken  that was my bad periodtoken  thats the only reason why i give baileys 45

dream of a day they will open a venue in colorado i know the best thing about this chain is their tasty slushes commatoken and that we get long cold winters commatoken but they are addictive and if we

fixed the typo commatoken i guess no yummy french feies for me   when i got there they had a long line out the door periodtoken the thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be

was fantastic i also tried the cajun fries they were good also still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head periodtoken they sell hot dogs at five guys commatoken so i might keep that as an option periodtokenalso for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger periodtoken   one thing that i will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil periodtoken also they have free peanuts available for customers periodtoken if you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably not for you periodtoken i just thought i would throw in that disclaimer periodtoken another heads up is how busy this place gets periodtoken you may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied periodtoken the prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under 10 periodtoken   it still boggles my mind that this place is fast food commatoken because it is almost as good as most

truly say that the brown butter pistachio commatoken chocolate glazed and the cookies and cream donut are some of the best donuts had periodtoken the brown butter pistachio has a nice nutty flavor with slightly salty salty pistachios commatoken the chocolate glazed is chocolatey yet not overwhelmingly sweet commatoken in fact its actually quite sinfully dark commatoken and the cookies and cream is sweet and crunchy and delicious periodtoken other than the donuts commatoken ive tried their fries and the fries are delicious periodtoken the cheesy fries are good but the cheese has a slightly gritty feel to it periodtoken thats about the only thing keeping me from giving that a 5 star review periodtoken over all its a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner and a big ol donut for dessert

great despite us sitting close to the outside opening was superb periodtoken  service was fast and friendly except waiting for a waiter to initially be assigned to us  hi yes commatoken were still

periodtoken  all were excellent periodtoken  the waitress waited to see if i liked he matcha because she warned that its not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if i preferred but im a

never ending sampling of dim sum  pork buns  4 periodtoken99 good but smaller than most my daughter didnt care for them here  and neither did gramma not sure why periodtoken  sticky rice excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for 4 periodtoken99  this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf periodtoken  literally commatoken the banana leaves had less than 12 of the amount of rice you would have at jumbo periodtoken   beef skewers  not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for 4 periodtoken99 for 2 periodtoken  green onion cake  4 periodtoken99 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though i prefer mine to be a little crunchier periodtoken  pan fried meat dumplings  4 periodtoken99 standard but they dont bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most dim sum places serve with it periodtoken  curried squid  4 periodtoken99 excellent and tender but i would love the sauce to be a bit thicker

be returning here periodtoken    even if mom and dad want regular chinese food commatoken the kids in our house will jump for joy at sticky rice commatoken green onion cakes commatoken and bubble tea

bit much for pad thai periodtoken   the decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant periodtoken i saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special  but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option periodtoken  its all good though periodtoken   cons i think its a bit overpriced given its location periodtoken if we were in the city it would make sense commatoken but not at willow grove periodtoken   lack of parking  maybe like 6 or 7 spots we parked at the pho  beyond shopping complex  and walked over periodtoken i think they should add another door near the

periodtoken","2668":"we visited village bakehouse after reading the reviews and were very happy we did periodtoken the place has such a homey feel commatoken but small periodtoken we waited a few minutes for a table commatoken but were occupied looking at all the goodies periodtoken the breakfast prices are very reasonable commatoken under 5 for many items periodtoken pecan sticky bun was amazing","2670":"oh first off commatoken it smells delicious  secondly commatoken it tastes delicious  we didnt know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts commatoken too commatoken which we ended up not being disappointed about periodtoken   they probably didnt tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken who knows periodtoken   i ordered sweet garlic wings commatoken the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch commatoken and we shared in order to try different flavors periodtoken they were both scrumptious but i preferred my sweet garlic periodtoken and the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense periodtoken   we also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though commatoken and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy periodtoken   anyway commatoken gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good periodtoken itll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5 periodtoken","2672":"they only take cash  so we took our ice cream addict for a pre dinner treat and picked up a delightful tray of flavors and creams periodtoken  i had the raspberry sherbet  stars  it was bland an unsweet but i guess that is my fault for coming to a creamery and ordering sherbet periodtoken  our cream addict devoured five favors for 5 dollars with sprinkles periodtoken  she was in ice cream heaven as she drooled the flavors down her lips periodtoken  it was delightful watching how much she was enjoying the cold delight periodtoken  my other companion enjoyed the cone and unfortunately had to cover the tab because i wasnt carrying cash periodtoken  i guess its not that big of a problem being that its right next to a chase banking branch periodtoken   but its 2015 commatoken who doesnt take credit card these days  parking is also finicy as many of the the streets are under construction and i dont know how they feel about you parking in the strip mall across the street periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","2675":"these are the best donuts around a lot of variety at a great price periodtoken the only downfall is the location but i deal with it for these donuts periodtoken the

elsewhere periodtoken if you want good bagels with butter commatoken cream cheese or plain periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthis is your spot periodtoken cinnamon raisin and everything bagels are really good","2691":"i should never eat here commatoken seriously it is so bad to eat donuts the kicker is you can see them make them and what makes them so unhealthy and taste so darn good   krispy kreme is a chain obviously and known for its hot donuts made fresh in store periodtoken they certainly live up to the name commatoken they are krispy and kremey periodtoken    i adore the good ole traditional glazed commatoken although i have been told the red velvet out during holiday season is delicious   the staff is incredibly friendly and always welcoming periodtoken   if i indulge in enjoying a sinful donut i typically opt for shipleys or foxs to support local business and they taste amazing but if i were near krispy kreme and had the craving i wouldnt pass it up","2693":"i am now a every week shopper periodtoken we made a change in our diets and this is the easest way we can shop commatoken other than reading every single label in a store periodtoken it is pricey commatoken but we have learned to really look at the prices and have found that there is plenty of ways to cut commatoken bying the whole foods brand really helps periodtoken everything is good here commatoken the people are always friendly periodtoken","2696":"another stop in the desperately hip district of edgehill periodtoken  much like the other places of business in the area commatoken edgehill studios pushes its postmodern architecture and ultratrendy atmosphere on its customers periodtoken  however commatoken because the sandwiches are affordable and because its so conducive to laptopers commatoken i had to give the place a star more than my gut wanted me to periodtoken  they make a decent cup of coffee commatoken and prices and selection are similar to places like portland brew and bongo java periodtoken  apparently they dont serve soup through the summer a bit of a bummer since i am a year round soup junkie commatoken but their selection is fairly diverse for such a small cafe periodtoken  edgehill studios cafe has more room than i expected commatoken and it typically isnt too busy commatoken so its an alright spot to duck in and do some web surfing periodtoken  the staff is quick and friendly commatoken and its usually pretty quiet periodtoken  i havent visited the actual studio or been on an evening with live music commatoken but i imagine it is pretty par for a coffee shopvenue periodtoken  i deem edgehill cafe worthy of your business commatoken but i just cant quite make it a regular stop periodtoken  ill stick to portland brew periodtoken","2703":"went with a friend for some free breakfast burritos periodtoken  i got the egg and chorizo version without potatoes periodtoken  added some medium salsa and ranchera sauce periodtoken  on the whole it was a delicious breakfast periodtoken  the eggs were nice and fluffy while the chorizo had a kick to it and the medium salsa lent a green aspect to each bite periodtoken  i must say the chorizo was just a bit oily periodtoken  i was sad they didnt strain it a tad better periodtoken  the tortilla was also just a touch on the too chewy side periodtoken  still though commatoken i enjoyed the whole thing periodtoken  service was also really nice and i enjoyed the lady behind the counter periodtoken  she was very chipper for 730 in the morning which i appreciated periodtoken","2714":"yum yum yum ive only been twice commatoken but its enough to stick in my memory and cause me to argue for a visit every time im in town periodtoken culpeppers for dinner commatoken then ted drewes for dessert  im a happy man periodtoken ive never seen them without lines 6 deep commatoken and thats with 6 or 8 windows operating still commatoken they move quickly and prices are amazingly good commatoken so its definitely worth it periodtoken ted drewes has been a local fixture for so long that youll see 3 generations of people hanging around eating and chatting  theres no seating commatoken so its either standing or sitting on the hoodtrunk of your car periodtoken with that many people milling around parking can be challenging periodtoken  the frozen custard itself is amazing periodtoken delicious and as smooth and rich as the highestquality ice cream youve ever had periodtoken a large range of excellent toppings and mixins are available periodtoken i thought my tart cherry and hot fudge cardinal sin was good until i tried my dads raspberry if he hadnt turned his back on me and walked away  after my one bite commatoken he might not have gotten any more periodtoken we could share it commatoken we could i guess ol dads not so dumb after all periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","2715":"great neighborhood restaurant periodtoken  we tried the fried catfish stuffed with crab commatoken redfish on the half shell commatoken gumbo commatoken stuffed mushrooms commatoken pork chop commatoken bbq shrimp and tuna stack periodtoken  i would definitely recommend the bbq shrimp commatoken the sauce was excellent commatoken and tuna stack for something on the lighter side periodtoken","2716":"its been a while since ive come to this la colombe commatoken but it hit the spot on a chilly evening after a day of exploring periodtoken the space is warm commatoken with a decent scattering of tables and benches in a cozy space right on the edge of cramped but not quite there periodtoken i got a hot chocolate with almond milk commatoken which was on point  very chocolate forward without being too sweet periodtoken my friend got their classic drip coffee a dark roast with milk and was pleased with the quality periodtoken we couldnt resist a bit of something sweet commatoken so split a canele  a cylindershaped french pastry with a deeply caramelized exterior and a surprisingly light and lemony interior periodtoken it was my first and it was a worthy indulgence periodtoken  there is no posted menu commatoken so the ordering can be a little confusing periodtoken but the baristas are knowledgeable and even gave me tastes of their different drip options to help me decide periodtoken  ive also seen this place quite crowded with laptop squatters as well as people meeting with friends  probably because its right off of rittenhouse square  so we lucked out in finding a spot periodtoken","2718":"this is my friendly commatoken neighborhood coffee shop periodtoken so i may be a little biased periodtoken but there are definitely some pros and cons to share periodtoken pros the baristas are great i can only think of 23 out of 25 situations that werent great commatoken energy is great easy to feel comfortable whether youre getting some alone time or meeting with folks  indoor and outdoor community tables are fantastic commatoken the food and pastries are wellmade make sure you try the raspberryricotta scone  best ever commatoken great noncoffee beverage options which can be rare periodtoken cons not too many outlets for laptop use not a huge deal commatoken but there have been a few times ive come with business to do and had to leave commatoken the method they use to brew coffee can leave some hefty silt that makes coffee thick and sometimes bitter were splitting hairs now  just get the americano instead commatoken its great commatoken there have been a few times my food has taken a while commatoken so its good to set yourself and others up for success by not being in a rush periodtoken honestly commatoken a few minor things notwithstanding commatoken i really love this place periodtoken i love what they do for my neighborhood periodtoken i couldnt be more grateful that i live a block away periodtoken","2721":"this expansive shopping center located right off charlotte pike will satisfy even the most picky asian shopper periodtoken apart from the typical frozen dumplings and mountains of sriracha commatoken the store offers everything from mexican spices to indian frozen roti and chinese desserts periodtoken the aisles are pretty well organized commatoken though the frozen food section is a bit lacking periodtoken i noticed some patrons also had difficulty navigating through the large amount of items periodtoken the store organizes based on ethnicity commatoken but not in any particular alphanumeric order periodtoken of the many i saw commatoken there were specific aisles for chinese commatoken korean commatoken thai and vietnamese food periodtoken i was pretty impressed by their fresh produce section covering about a third of the store and the extensive live fish selection along the entire back of the restaurant periodtoken  this will probably be my staple shopping area for specific ingredients periodtoken keep in mind they only accept card for purchases above 3 periodtoken00 periodtoken they also were unpacking large shipments of frozen goods when i went in the early afternoon commatoken so be careful to navigate around the cardboard maze if you catch them at that time periodtoken","2727":"what a charming vineyard

place to go with friends if your looking for a fun modern upscale atmosphere periodtoken","2743":"the customer service was great periodtoken only rating this place 45 stars because the pita was a bit hard commatoken which made it difficult to chew commatoken and the setting was a bit crowded which they obviously cant help but a nice thing is they deliver or you can get pick up periodtoken the smoothie was soo good periodtoken also commatoken you can tell falafel sandwich had fresh ingredients and the portion definitely met the cost periodtoken i would order from here again","2751":"a really good ice creamery with a million unique flavors commatoken and the ability to order 4 or 6 small scoops so you can try a bunch periodtoken i was pretty full walking in commatoken but still managed to eat 4 scoops and liked them all periodtoken the ice cream itself is maybe not quite the super gourmet vibe of jenis or salt and straw commatoken but it was all very good and there are lots of cool flavors to try periodtoken","2752":"really solid beer selection  us commatoken canadian commatoken belgian commatoken european periodtoken  canned beer seems to be a point of pride in their

premium periodtoken","2761":"did you know canned goods here are often cheaper than in chain grocery stores in edmonton i like to buy amys products because their can linings do not contain bpe and all

local commatoken but its usually affordable periodtoken  organic mandarins i got a case for a great price  they were ripe and ready to eat periodtoken  not like the ones from the chain store that are a real hit or miss periodtoken  it is a smaller location than the main store on whyte ave commatoken but i generally find pretty much everything i shop for here  dishwasher detergent pucks commatoken gluten free flour commatoken heck i even got a straw cleaning brush  if you cant find something or in a hurry like me staff can point you to where you should find it periodtoken sometimes i come

came on a slow sunday they juuuust opened what commatoken 2 weeks ago to a strip mall and walked inside to see a pretty small eating establishment periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken which made us

commatoken grilled fish neck commatoken and sushi periodtoken  they were all delicious periodtoken  in particular commatoken i liked the pork belly wrapped asparagus skewer periodtoken  it wasnt seasoned commatoken making me think of sam gap sal periodtoken  it was gosh darned tasty periodtoken    the chop chae salad was potato glass noodles with greens and a spicy chili oil vinaigrette thing that was pretty good periodtoken    the sushi periodtoken  this is what we really came for periodtoken  the fish was about room temperature and was just meltinyour mouth quality periodtoken  you know how hard it is to find a place that has a decent yellowtail roll with green onion  its absurd periodtoken  i really hope they hold their standards to this high a bar periodtoken  finally commatoken the hamachi kama was fresh commatoken moist commatoken and delicious periodtoken  it wasnt precured or anything commatoken though periodtoken  it was just plain simple fresh fish neck that sat on the grill undisturbed periodtoken    the only gripe i had was that the skewers were pretty expensive for their size commatoken which averaged a bit over 2 bucks apiece periodtoken  i dont know if they have a happy hour commatoken but i will likely steer clear of that part of the menu otherwise periodtoken  we found ourselves easily dropping more than 20 bucks a person for this place commatoken but that was simply because we felt the need to try all our staples periodtoken  all in all commatoken we will definitely be coming back again periodtoken  if you like plain old fashioned japanese food

commatoken digital transmission commatoken or they turn around and tell the barista what to prepare and ive missed it every time commatoken because im trying to figure out how much youre supposed to tip on a 2 periodtoken48 coffee periodtoken   their prices lean on the side of pretentious for a coffee shop commatoken but i do like going there and its very conveniently located between where i live and work periodtoken   the staff is nice periodtoken i can usually find a table periodtoken they have a really cool round table in the corner that people must camp out to get in the morning commatoken because seriously theres always someone sitting there periodtoken its always a girl like stressing out about a final she should have been more prepared for commatoken too periodtoken   i had breakfast there once periodtoken i found it to be worthy of them having a menu commatoken whereas some coffee shops make the food more of an add on and less of a specialty periodtoken i enjoy their small plates commatoken like the cucumber commatoken goat cheese commatoken and honey plate commatoken because who can even get through the day without a healthy little treat like that periodtoken   and thats what it boils down to periodtoken we all need a little treat sometime periodtoken when its 3 pm and you know you cant lift another finger until you get a little treat in your system periodtoken you deserve it","2845":"this is becoming a great option for sushi at lunch time periodtoken ive been a couple of times with a few coworkers periodtoken the service has always been quick and efficient periodtoken its a modern and clean environment periodtoken i like to sit in the booths facing towards the escalators periodtoken its just interesting to watch the reaction of people on the second level as theyre

all quite filling periodtoken theyve recently added more items to the menu periodtoken they have many nonsushi items to pick from as well periodtoken  it all looks tempting periodtoken  i can see the

excited to eat a gyros sandwich and check out this local cafe that somehow had slipped my eye all these years periodtoken when i first went in commatoken i was fully geared up to order the gyros sandwich commatoken but then i saw the menu and spent a good 5 minutes debating whether or not i should change my mind periodtoken the manager i think was really patient and offered up some recommendations commatoken and i ended up getting a pita melt with turkey instead periodtoken this would just give me an excuse to come back another time to try the gyros periodtoken  the pita was great and immediately made me a repeat customer commatoken as i came back a few days later periodtoken i love how the restaurant is run by a family and how friendly and talkative they are every time im here periodtoken the place is never really crowded commatoken as i think most people come here to grab food to go commatoken but its nice to have the option to eat in periodtoken  on days that i wanted to trick myself into thinking i was eating healthier commatoken i would order a gyros salad which provided the satisfaction of eating a gyro but with significantly more veggies periodtoken  i love blackberry cafe especially since it falls in line with my goal of supporting local dining locales periodtoken the service and friendliness also really helps periodtoken just expect a brief wait for your food as they prep it when you order so everything comes out fresh periodtoken also commatoken the parking can be a problem since blackberry cafe shares a small metered lot with three other places periodtoken but this should not deter you from stopping in and grabbing a delicious meal periodtoken","2892":"hadnt been here for several years periodtoken   we were pleasantly surprised

unfortunately are two areas are in need of serious attention periodtoken  i understand from the reviews the noise level is an issue periodtoken  first thing i said to my husband when i sat down  it is so noisy in here periodtoken  this is a serious problem when you cannot hear the person next to you periodtoken  cozy is one thing  incredibly loud that it took away from the experience is something else periodtoken  i think the later you make a reservation commatoken the better it is periodtoken but commatoken that did not help the service periodtoken  the other area for me that was a negative was the amount of time it took for us to eat periodtoken  it was a thursday night and yes it was packed periodtoken  however commatoken three hours for a dinner for two and waiting 30 minutes for bread and another 30 minutes once our dessert was finished and wine had been gone was way too much periodtoken  when servers take notice and see that you have no wine commatoken your dessert has been finished a while ago commatoken there is nothing for you to do because your backs are hurting from sitting so long commatoken they could lose the uberchill vibe and ask if you are ready for your check periodtoken  only three tables remained and still took a long time to get to the table periodtoken  in the beginning commatoken once the wine was poured commatoken it took 30 minutes to get a menu and another large amount of time for bread periodtoken  the wait staff were nice however commatoken inattentive periodtoken  laid back is the vibe i got commatoken but they were so laid back we thought they simply forgot about us periodtoken  i get that the experience is not rushed and you are supposed to feel as if you are in someones home commatoken but the wait and the noise took away from the

simultaneously periodtoken  rating breakdown  22 stars for taste  i got the cowboy burger served rare periodtoken the patty was meaty commatoken thick commatoken and grilled perfectly with just the

were good commatoken the pistachio and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream were delicious periodtoken i wasnt terribly impressed with the apple brown betty because it was a bit more apple than i would like periodtoken but if you are a fan of such things commatoken it was warm commatoken sweet commatoken and moist  very satisfying in my belly on a rainy day periodtoken  11stars for value  most burgers and entrees were around 10 and came with a side of fries periodtoken however commatoken large plates can also cost upward of 15 commatoken trespassing into a nono zone for me personally periodtoken desserts were 4 each but come in decentsized portions that make them worth trying periodtoken you wont leave this place hungry commatoken for sure periodtoken generous portions ensure you leave here stuffed periodtoken  11 stars for customer service  the wait staff here was definitely very hipster commatoken  wearing colored jeans or cutoff jean shorts commatoken which i found endearing periodtoken our waitress was very friendly periodtoken we had been in the car for over 5 hours so we were guzzling water with no abandon periodtoken she made sure our glasses were always full commatoken even if it meant coming back every 5 minutes or so periodtoken also commatoken one of my pet peeves is waiting forever for the check  receipt periodtoken the waitress sensed we were in a hurry and came back promptly after i gave her my card periodtoken  no bonus star because even though the food was good commatoken it wasnt anything terribly special for the price periodtoken there are definitely other places id be more willing to drop 10 at in philly periodtoken however commatoken if youre in the area and in the mood for both burgers and ice cream commatoken this is good place to stop by","2910":"came here for dinner but the wait was 2hrs long so we sat at the bar periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken soooo glad we did periodtoken firstly commatoken jason is the

periodtoken","2950":"fantastic breakfast spot periodtoken  i went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times commatoken but both times commatoken the food was excellent periodtoken  the first time commatoken the line was 10 deep commatoken and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order periodtoken  it might have been because she kept screwing it up  my rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on sunday

sundried tomatos periodtoken  the burger was cooked to my liking and was well seasoned  there an number of what would be considered upscale burger places in the nashville area that dont seem to know how to season ground beef and charge plenty more than granite city periodtoken  my only complaint is that commatokenas it turns out commatoken the balsamic dressing in combination with the sundried

the service was also greatfriendly and quickespecially the stylish water server periodtoken   cyranos is definitely on my shortlist of places to visit next time im in town  trivia the character of cyrano de bergerac was only loosely based on the real man commatoken a dramatist whos work included early spacefaring science fiction periodtoken the real man was known somewhat for his love life look it up commatoken and a genus of damselfly is named after him periodtoken","3240":"another saturday afternoon in the books commatoken and i can honestly say it ended up satisfactory commatoken

add noncrunchified spicy rolls to their menu commatoken but i always request without tempura crumbs and theyre happy to accommodate periodtoken","3246":"im not sure i liked it as much as some of the other reviewers commatoken but was better than i expected periodtoken this location has been a number of different things crown fried chicken commatoken but the service was friendly commatoken it was fast commatoken and the steak and roll was pretty good periodtoken not as good as genos or steves imho commatoken but better than others like pats for instance periodtoken the meat isnt ground up like you see in some places periodtoken  not much inside in terms of furniture or places to sit commatoken so more of a take out spot periodtoken they have some of the normal side items soda and chips commatoken but at least the day i went they were out of some things i periodtokene periodtoken only had diet coke and not regular coke periodtoken  bottom line commatoken i would give them another try

convenient and like that you can make your own 6packs periodtoken they carry a large variety of beers periodtoken yes commatoken you can easily spend a lot on beer here but i think its worth it given

this is a solid commatoken fresh tasting burger periodtoken  not amazing commatoken not the best burger ive ever had commatoken but solid periodtoken  someone complained about all of the references to innout commatoken but i think the comparison is completely appropriate periodtoken  the style of burger is similar and it gives a person an idea of what kind of burger to expect periodtoken  it is similar commatoken but in my opinion commatoken a little better periodtoken  maybe because we of the weather commatoken or because there was a teriyaki burger option periodtoken  had a bit of a regular char burger too commatoken and that was solid as well periodtoken  but my onion rings were what was really good periodtoken  crisp and you could actually eat it with the onion periodtoken  the onion didnt come flying out the first bite like most onion rings periodtoken  the berating on them was really good periodtoken  i would also like to say how awesome it is that the habits burgers come with caramelized onions automatically periodtoken  all burgers should periodtoken  so yes commatoken i can make a much better burger at home commatoken but the habit makes a soli fresh tasting burger periodtoken","3274":"great spot for all casual affairs  this location is perfect if you just want to grab a cup of great coffee to go commatoken or if you prefer to enjoy it inside  there is ample seating space to sip at your leisure periodtoken  it is located within rittenhouse area commatoken so the parking will be tough periodtoken i typically park a few blocks south and work my way up

of tables and even small booths to get a group together for coffee and work periodtoken many people seem to find this location ideal to open up their laptop and enjoy a good coffee periodtoken   the coffee is what sells this place  great roasts commatoken with bold commatoken rich flavors periodtoken as you walk in you can smell the amazing scents  and it tastes just as great as it smells  the

periodtoken although the lunch crowd can make a line out the door each weekday commatoken i still love it and always see about 5 others from my office commatoken so its an easy sell to get a walking partner periodtoken  i have tried many things on the menu commatoken but my go to favorite is the unforgettable baggins sandwich periodtoken i get the wholesome half which includes 1 side and a fountain drink with your half sandwich periodtoken the whole sandwich is huge commatoken so this 7 deal is awesome for a quick grab and go lunch periodtoken i enjoy the sesame pasta salad with it periodtoken  you can also switch things up like adding cranberries or green chiles for another 45 cents periodtoken many of their normal toppings can be added for free as well periodtoken  i suggest that if you go there between 121 pm on a weekday commatoken you should call or order online ahead of time periodtoken i like ordering online because you dont feel so rushed as when you call on the phone periodtoken you can also see all of the extra toppings you can get commatoken which is nice if youre in the mood for experimenting periodtoken  i just went there about an hour ago commatoken i ordered online and doublechecked my noavocado unforgettable im allergic commatoken tear and it did have it on there periodtoken i brought it to the manager and she personally made me a new sandwich

periodtoken","3283":"5 mimosas to follow a new years eve hangover you had me at hello periodtoken pub and kitchen is a very relaxed and easygoing hangout spot with good food to match periodtoken the bf and i were both craving some red meat so we decided to try pk periodtoken we were seated in the back little private dining room which is cozy with lots of small tables commatoken exposed brick commatoken and natural light periodtoken the burger was cooked to my liking and they were very accommodating to some topping substitutions periodtoken i loved the fries and the food commatoken the waiter was extremely cool periodtoken   the only downside  and it had nothing to do with pk  was the fact that because of the mummers parade there seemed to be tons of loud families in what would usually not be a typical family establishment periodtoken i love kids as much as the next gal but sometimes usually after a night of heavy drinking you just want to eat your burger and drink your alchy sans rugrats periodtoken","3288":"good beer nice bartender would have given it a 5 if it had ac to hot in the mid of summer had to leave to soon but we will be back","3290":"just a quick review on the dessert spot we discovered this past weekend periodtoken  i had heard good things about frost before commatoken and didnt know there was a location on oracle near where my wife and i do a lot of our tucson shopping periodtoken  so when we had the opportunity to stop in commatoken we took advantage periodtoken  the staff was helpful commatoken greeting us as we walked in commatoken and allowing us to sample freely until we made our decision periodtoken  my wife went with a lemon gelato commatoken and i had a combination of black cherry and raspberry periodtoken  all three flavors were excellent commatoken and we felt like it was a good value for the price periodtoken  yes it is a bit more expensive than your typical scoop of ice cream commatoken but the quality reflects that price commatoken so we still feel like we got a good deal periodtoken  the only knock i have is on their drinks periodtoken  they have tea and cocoa listed on the menu commatoken but the person who rang us up admitted they dont serve them anymore and should take them off periodtoken  i appreciated the honesty periodtoken","3291":"i was told by a lady at work that this truck was the same as mexicali commatoken which ive heard great things about and have been meaning to try periodtoken  in reality commatoken mexiphilly is not mexicali commatoken despite how similar they sound commatoken but its not bad  i was apprehensive because of the low rating on yelp periodtoken  i decided to try it anyways since it featured vegetarian burritos similar to mexicali and i had been prepping myself for the sweet potato burrito ever since the morning when i realized all i had for lunch was a cupcake periodtoken  i ordered the sweet potato burrito with the medium chipotle and hot habanero sauces as well as jalapenos periodtoken  a lot of people around me in line ordered the sweet potato burrito as well commatoken so it seemed like the way to go periodtoken  there were only a few orders before mine commatoken and i received my food in a little over 5 minutes periodtoken  i didnt experience any confusion in the orders commatoken but probably because there werent that many people to keep track of periodtoken  the woman who worked there was very nice and recommended that i put both sauces on my burrito good idea  my burrito was very enjoyable periodtoken  to me commatoken burritos filled with things like sweet potato commatoken plantains commatoken eggplant commatoken and spinach were very novel and unexpected periodtoken  i liked that it was toasted on the grill periodtoken  the burrito came with both black and pinto beans commatoken and the sauces i had ordered periodtoken  i thought the flavors of the fillings were great together commatoken but the burrito was not evenly distributed commatoken so half of it was delicious while the other half with only sweet potato and no sauce was not as flavorful and pretty mushy periodtoken  my friend got the eggplant commatoken which was pretty good and contained a couple more veggie including celery periodtoken  the burritos were a good size commatoken pleasantly filling but nowhere near food comainducing periodtoken  good bang for your buck at 3 periodtoken50 a burrito  this is probably more of a 3 periodtoken5 commatoken but i think this food truck deserves more stars than it has gotten commatoken so im rounding up periodtoken  maybe ill try mexicali in a bit and then will have to downgrade this one periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken","3297":"yum periodtoken tater tots on pizza periodtoken late

to the american palate periodtoken thats one thing i love about it periodtoken ive eaten greek food in greece commatoken and commatoken with a few exceptions commatoken its pretty much the same everywhere periodtoken what sets one greek restaurant apart from another are two things selection of food and qualitypreparation of ingredients periodtoken  hellas is a very large restaurant periodtoken they offer free parking behind the building a ticket your server gives you at the end of your meal periodtoken im eating there anyway commatoken i get free parking while im at it periodtoken in season commatoken the wait for a table can take a minute commatoken so be prepared periodtoken the bakery is always mobbed commatoken so be ready for that at any time of year periodtoken my only real issue with hellas is how close the tables are together periodtoken its tight commatoken guys periodtoken dont consider this place for heart to heart conversations periodtoken  i love the menu here periodtoken very traditional greek commatoken with a lot of items you dont see and many items you do normally see periodtoken on my most recent visit commatoken we got the trio of spreads and i ordered a chicken souvlaki sandwich periodtoken the trio of spreads is a lovely hummus commatoken perfect tzatziki and a feta spread my favorite with perfectly toasted pita triangles periodtoken the chicken was really commatoken really good periodtoken the ingredients were fresh and the sandwich was assembled so that many perfect bites were achievable periodtoken   i took a slice of baklava cheesecake home and had it for dinner periodtoken that was a good call periodtoken","3308":"yes commatoken this certainly can be considered a tourist trap periodtoken however i am still a fan just barely this is a large farm and country store that features various pick your own options depending on the season periodtoken for the fall that means pumpkins and apples periodtoken   my biggest qualm with this place is that there is no difference in price between pick your own or those items picked up in the store periodtoken and you have to pay for a tractor ride out to the fields4 periodtoken00 would it kill them to deduct the fee from your purchase anyway commatoken we did it for the experience and it was fun commatoken and from the children we encountered commatoken they were enjoying it too periodtoken but at  periodtoken79 a lb for pumpkins commatoken you would save mucho dinero by purchasing them from your local supermarket who most likely also buys them from this farm at much cheaper costs  while on the hayride you also have an option to pick apples periodtoken again commatoken same cost inside the store commatoken and the apples on the tree are huge periodtoken think of the  chocolate covered monsters you see at the holidays and you are getting close periodtoken   the store boasts many varieties of baked goods periodtoken from these we sampled a pumpkin blondie that was incredible periodtoken there are also sandwiches commatoken salads commatoken snack foods and take home dinners to name just a few periodtoken some of these food options are also available outside on busy weekend days periodtoken you can tell that much thought has gone into maximizing commercial viability periodtoken there are other activities for children here including a petting zoo commatoken corn maze and other farm like displays periodtoken most of these activities carry fees also periodtoken  overall i am thrilled that this farm is thriving periodtoken places like this can connect us to the land commatoken and provide children with their first glimpses of where our food really comes from periodtoken but i cant help but imagine that a generation ago this operation would not be so commercialized periodtoken and i really hope that this trend does not continue to worsen periodtoken because if it does it could exclude those who may appreciate and need it the most periodtoken 4 pumpkin spiced yelps","3309":"omg  food coma  excellent prices and large helpings periodtoken  im not going to rave about the food but we did leave quite satisfied for what it was periodtoken  the price point is on point   ya dont need to spend much chedda to eat the chadda its an inexpensive decent meal i guess is the main bullet point im trying to make here periodtoken   i had the monte cristo which was good and the chips and queso which i gobbled right up  the staff was very friendly and helpful periodtoken","3313":"i am a very happy customer periodtoken the food was

san luis obispo with our 8 month old son and decided to stop in santa barbara for lunch periodtoken  living in the midwest and missing the ocean commatoken we were craving seafood periodtoken  i used my yelp app on my phone to find this spot periodtoken  the location is great  at the end of a pier overlooking the pacific periodtoken  the atmosphere is very casual and familyfriendly and parking is easy and can be validated periodtoken  my main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh commatoken the majority of it was flown in from other locales mostly atlantic ocean periodtoken  it just seemed so silly to eat seafood flown in while sitting next to the ocean periodtoken  i had the crab sandwich not local crab and it was really delicious periodtoken  my husband had the lobster from maine tacos and was disappointed periodtoken  i tasted it as well and found that they werent terrible but all the seasoning and additions really took away from the great taste of lobster periodtoken  service was good commatoken beers were good commatoken and the location is great commatoken so while i think this place is a solid 3 periodtoken5 stars commatoken i will bump it up to 4 periodtoken  cant beat oceanfront dining","3315":"i believe they have new management now periodtoken the produce section has vastly improved periodtoken   no

settled for their burger which was definitely good periodtoken meat was cooked to perfection and the addition of the bacon was just what made the burger pretty memorable periodtoken i would say im a burger snob and i prefer burgers that arent bleeding and mooing rare but i dont want my burger tough enough to chuck it at someone well periodtoken i like them medium rare and they were quite successful in that regard periodtoken i would love to come back to try their bread since ive heard its one of the best around but it definitely is a must come back place","3332":"after two days of packing cold cut sandwiches for volunteer work lunches commatoken we found that zimmers was within 5 blocks of our gentilly work site so we decided to get po boys to go for ourselves periodtoken the

commatoken oyster commatoken veal commatoken and well as 12and12 sandwiches periodtoken i had an excellent large fried catfish sandwich the first day that had 45 big catfish pieces on each half of the sandwich that i got 23 through  the rest made for a tasty nighttime snack later when i was working on my computer periodtoken whenever i order fried seafood po boys commatoken i doctor up mine with ketchup and hot sauce which adds a little extra kick periodtoken  the next day commatoken i ordered a small fried shrimp sandwich that was generously stuffed with shrimp and was delicious periodtoken all too many places that fry food do not change their frying oil often enough but this is not the case at zimmers periodtoken zimmers is a great find and worth seeking out periodtoken","3333":"ive come here almost on a weekly basis for the past few years to watch soccer periodtoken an excellent place to watch a match there is not place that can compare outside of the downtown location

while","3348":"just stated trying this place a few weeks ago and i enjoy the food and prompt service periodtoken the sauces here is the star commatoken and there are plenty of combination available in term of food choice periodtoken i end up getting the same thing commatoken but sooner or later ill start to try other things periodtoken for side dishes commatoken the new balsamic tomatoes are

brand commatoken even there big bag of cat food is just 2 bucks periodtoken","3357":"this was my third visit to the this place commatoken yet it was the first time my burger was even slightly interesting periodtoken it was more than that commatoken it was great i always wanted this place to be awesome commatoken but every burger i ordered was under seasoned and bland periodtoken not to mention the high price you pay upwards of 10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you dont get a side with it periodtoken now im willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch which i believe theirs is and when the flavor is amazing which it hadnt been until yesterday periodtoken so commatoken maybe its time for me to give this place another try periodtoken  i have actually always been a fan of their fries commatoken their house made sauces and their onion rings periodtoken   their ice cream was never really my favorite periodtoken i really prefer a creamier ice cream and i feel theirs is on the ice side periodtoken however commatoken i think ive come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that its just different periodtoken my favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream periodtoken i got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well  annoyances worth mentioning  the service ive always had servers with decent attitudes commatoken but theyve never been terribly attentive periodtoken i always feel like im looking around for them and waiting for them to come back periodtoken i dont know if theyre understaffed  the noise this place is super echoey and super loud it made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation periodtoken   parking periodtoken its not easy or cheap

pretty good periodtoken but the great food was our entrees periodtoken i got the goat masala commatoken which was incredible if youve never tried goat commatoken i recommend it it tastes very similar to beefsteak and this restaurant prepares it deliciously periodtoken the other people i was with both got chicken madras commatoken which was also good commatoken but i liked mine better all of our entrees came with a big pot of basmati an indian rice and freshly baked naan a type of flat bread which was a good bonus the service was a tad bit slow and it took a little longer than usual to get our food commatoken but that makes for more time to visit with and enjoy the company of friends and family periodtoken overall commatoken you can expect well seasoned commatoken tasty commatoken

when another friend inquired about what barbacoa was commatoken the waitress gave her best answer and then double checked with someone else in order to ensure that my fellow diner could make an informed decision periodtoken  a two star bjs does not bring out a garlic roll for the toddler who might be just a little less patient about waiting for her food periodtoken the lutz location served my daughter a drink and a complimentary roll right away periodtoken i thought this was a fabulous idea because my daughter is still at the age where she tells me she wants mac and cheese and she thinks it should be there moments later periodtoken the roll helped to stem the constant where is my mac and cheese questions because she had something to snack on periodtoken  does this location have some kinks to work out probably periodtoken they mixed up checks once when i was there periodtoken had her drinks on his and vice versa periodtoken but considering that they are restaurant that has

their fresh hopped ale harvest ale this 2010 was amazing but the other styles are commatoken by microbrewery standards commatoken perfectly acceptable periodtoken  the reason i felt the need to add to the 90 reviews is that i think it is worth noting that this is a beercentric place that is also welcoming to kids or at least highly tolerant of them periodtoken  i have taken my 2 year old there several times and have never been made to feel that he is not welcome there are always other kids periodtoken  however i dont think the presence of kids detracts from the atmosphere for adults because

story two of us in our party had our minds made up even though we were originally deciding between two different burgers periodtoken  it took the waiter about 3 seconds to get us to change our minds due to the burger being his personal favorite periodtoken  everyone we encountered was friendly and accommodating  2 facility  this place is huge commatoken with an upstairs and downstairs seating area commatoken and it is definitely great for large groups periodtoken  the environment was very casual yet not rowdy  3 burgers  i decided to go with the abc burger commatoken which contained roasted apples commatoken bacon and i gotta say it was definitely interesting and thoroughly enjoyable periodtoken  my other coworkers decided to get the morocco burger spiced lamb commatoken caramelized onion chutney commatoken feta commatoken arugula and seemed to be extremely satisfied periodtoken  everything on the food menu is homemade and locallyraised  4 fries  yep commatoken the fries deserved their own little section periodtoken  4 gets you a large helping big enough for 23 to share comfortably along with one of their 10 different dipping sauces periodtoken  we went with the

an interesting experience  overall commatoken i really like this place and would recommend it to any group or casual diner periodtoken  prices are in the 912 range for burgers but can quickly add up if you get a ton of the other stuff","3500":"my local supermarket of choice periodtoken i have shopped here consistently since 2000 periodtoken it is a very busy store with a lot of walk in customers

it wasnt the serene study oasis id expected periodtoken especially since i got stuck studying at the bar commatoken and had to sit on a backless barstool which is less than optimal for hunching over a contracts textbook for hours periodtoken  all that aside commatoken they have scores of varieties of tea and you can get an entire pot for just a few bucks and the pots come with cookies periodtoken they also have helpful descriptions of each particular tea for novices like myself that explain the flavors and effects periodtoken it is also a nice commatoken open commatoken and welllit space

salad under it all but the dressing makes up for that periodtoken  main course commatoken i know the whole fish is great periodtoken  i also like the gyro platter and the grape leaves periodtoken  dessert is probably the best periodtoken  great baklava and the greek cannolis are similar to lobster tails in boston periodtoken","3526":"i got the darkness chocolate croissant and the tiramisu brownie periodtoken the darkness was a little underwhelming commatoken not much flavor despite the boasting of chocolatey goodness periodtoken it was also a little too salty for my tastes periodtoken

philly periodtoken besides commatoken bobbys burger palace was disappointing lately so we were craving for something new periodtoken  500 degrees is surprisingly lowly ranked on yelp commatoken but similar to bobbys burger palace i have the impression that its actually due to its popularity periodtoken bbp has weaknesses  inconsistent burgers commatoken occasionally horrible service and unpleasant atmosphere when its packed periodtoken 500 degrees also has its fair share of weaknesses periodtoken i thought their sauces was rather bad especially the ketchup and while i appreciate their open kitchen commatoken i didnt really want to see how their fries are taken out of the freezer instead of being freshly cut periodtoken on the other hand commatoken their burger totally makes up for it periodtoken we got a 500 and a classic with guacamole commatoken both medium rare commatoken along with truffle fries and sweet potato fries periodtoken the burgers were cooked exactly the

slight sweetness of the buns periodtoken despite being taken out of the freezer commatoken the truffle fries are actually wellmade because they spray truffle oil at the end commatoken keeping the fries nicely crispy periodtoken finally commatoken the sweet potato fries were delicious but not overwhelming periodtoken  with 12 periodtoken50 for a burger commatoken truffle fries and a fountain drink commatoken i thought the prices were pretty good periodtoken cheaper than bobbys burger palace at least periodtoken all in all commatoken this is a place i would enjoy to come back to commatoken

this may be my new favorite lunch spot when needing a break from the crazies that come through my office periodtoken the shop reminds me a bit of central perk on friends with its eclectic mix of furniture and the locals that are often enjoying their morning cups of coffee it has a generally cofortable and welcoming feel to it and the staff is really friendly periodtoken as far as i know theres no credit card minimum commatoken but ill have to report back later on that periodtoken free wifi commatoken open mic nights commatoken a kidlet section complete with toys commatoken and a lengthy food and drink menu all add extra appeal to this cute shop nestled amongst chelten plaza periodtoken where other storefronts in the plaza stay barren commatoken this is the blocks shining star

impressed by it and as much as i thought it would be a lame waste of time i really enjoyed it    i learned a few things commatoken like the fact that beachwood adds no flavor to the beer at all periodtoken   it is the same wood that popsicle sticks are made from periodtoken  they add it to the brewing process so the yeast works better periodtoken   i learned that at the only difference between bud and bud light is that bud light spends one additional hour in one part of the process which lightens the beer periodtoken  budweiser owns other brands commatoken like stella and goose island periodtoken  i loved the old buildings and enjoyed the history     the horses were cool periodtoken  i didnt turn down the cup of budweiser that they gave me at one point in the tour or the free one you get in the beer garden periodtoken   i ordered goose island commatoken more to my liking periodtoken   i enjoyed meeting a bud employee periodtoken  great guy periodtoken  the official

commatoken and chocolate chip cookies periodtoken  on the savory side commatoken their breakfast pockets are excellent periodtoken  they also serve above average pizza but its overpriced and tends to be too salty in my opinion periodtoken  the only wholly negative experiences ive had with the place are the occasional rude employees periodtoken  for example commatoken the place takes delivery orders commatoken and once an employee actually had the gall to tell me to hurry up and that he didnt have all day while i was placing an order over the phone how rude periodtoken  and sometimes theyre a bit reluctant to elaborate and describe items when deliberating between the vast array of treats they offer periodtoken  i feel they should help because the item names are generally not indicative of what they are so the employees should help you understand what youre buying periodtoken  ps  if the place offered free tap water like starbucks i think it would make a huge positive difference because its a long and unconventional walk for many people to get here periodtoken","3646":"while on vacation in clearwater my family and i traveled to tarpon springs for greek food

periodtoken my only drawbacks were the service as dirty plates were left on our table throughout our meal and drinks were never refilled promptly periodtoken the decor is also very tacky in a meditaranean greek disco club sort of way commatoken but gave the place some charm periodtoken all in all i would recommend hellas to any out of towners looking to experience the local tarpon springs greek culture periodtoken","3648":"cramped feeling commatoken but very friendly staff   we know that wf is always a great place to grab a healthy snack or drink today it was just a giant bottle of 365

we love periodtoken  the front room looks like an old time train station waiting area commatoken with its dramatic hanging lights commatoken banquettes commatoken and tiny tables and the bridgette bardot poster periodtoken    the wine menu is heavily french and not cheap commatoken so savor those glasses commatoken but they will give you a taste before you invest periodtoken  for example commatoken they had a veuve cliquot yellow label open to try by the glass 13 commatoken and a full bottle was 84 periodtoken   most wine places dont have such an expensive bottle available for glasses

with chicken instead of shrimp periodtoken everything was fresh and great quality commatoken but overall kind of bland periodtoken the avocado dressing just tasted like a pureed avocado commatoken which isnt necessarily a bad thing commatoken but if youre looking for a flavor punch that dressing will not suffice periodtoken if you get chicken commatoken its ground meat instead of choppedjust fyi in case you dont realize it when you order periodtoken i think the ground chicken definitely makes the bowl look more like that classic clean meal prep lunch periodtoken im sure there are other bowls with dressings that are far more tasty periodtoken i mean commatoken they even have a healthy mac and cheese periodtoken but when i come here its either the intention to go all the way and eat as many greens as possible periodtoken   as others have said commatoken grabbagreen is a great option if youre really trying to stick to a healthy eating habit periodtoken or if youre like me

am not accustomed to this style periodtoken  i like mine cooked through and sliced in rings commatoken rather than large commatoken soft commatoken tenderized whole pieces there were 4 periodtoken  this may be a traditional greek style of grilled squid commatoken but i wasnt open minded enough for its mushy texture periodtoken    personally commatoken i thought the horiatiki salad could have

the mexican sodas coke commatoken sprite commatoken and fanta orange at a very reasonable price for center city standards periodtoken  the availability of sodas out of glass bottles and made with real

had the vegan alfredo bowl today commatoken made with zoodles zucchini noodles which i have to say wasnt as amazing as i had hoped periodtoken it was more on the watery and bland end but definitely something different than your typical mushroom alfredo periodtoken im not sure how they make their sauce commatoken but my mom makes alfredo sauce out of cashews and if you do it right commatoken you can still get a creamy texture periodtoken anyway my boyfriend ordered the bison burger which came with a side of your choice periodtoken he said it was pretty goodthe bun is not bread commatoken but

trays because he could see it in my eyes how much i liked them periodtoken  the other item was some sort of sushi roll commatoken which always blows my mind that a place thats not a sushi restaurant can execute a sushi roll so well when a lot of real sushi restaurants are not good at all periodtoken thank you earls for having legit red seal chefs periodtoken the only reason this isnt 5 stars is that they crammed 60 people into an area designed for no more than 30 periodtoken at least i got to know people a little better commatoken which was the whole point of the mixer","4634":"we ate here on our last night in new orleans periodtoken the dining room was very clean and our waitress was greatreally friendly and attentive we ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer commatoken and i had the fried shrimp platter periodtoken the portions were very generous and the food was good good goodmuch better than we expected from a small dinertype establishment periodtoken its also open quite a bit later than most of the other dinein restaurants in the area periodtoken very glad that we checked it out","4636":"great selection ordered the happy herd which was more than enough for 5 people periodtoken food was a bit cold but overall great taste will definitely be coming back periodtoken","4641":"stoneyhead brewing is one of the most inconspicuous and even overlooked breweries in our region periodtoken  which is a real shame commatoken since there are fantastic and enjoyable brews on tap here that any beerhunter in reno should definitely check out periodtoken  if you have never visited stoneyhead before commatoken make sure to ask about a tasting flight periodtoken  on your first visit commatoken for no charge commatoken you will get small splashes of just about everything they have on tap periodtoken  i really appreciate this sort of customer service commatoken as it is a fine way to let newcomers get an idea of what suites their own tastes commatoken especially since they dont focus just on one type or style of beer here commatoken but instead brew a little bit of everything from pales to porters periodtoken  i tried a few things tonight commatoken since it had been a good while since last i passed through their doors periodtoken  if you are looking for something not so heavy commatoken i would recommend both the dlight commatoken and especially the honey pale periodtoken  the latter of which i found utterly delicious commatoken and perhaps one of the better light pales ive had from around our region periodtoken  the irish red is also quite delightful and to which i can eagerly give thumbs up to periodtoken  on the stronger side of things commatoken the sneak attack is very enjoyable british ipa which has a nice lightness and sweetness to it commatoken much different from the ultrabitter ipas i am accustomed to periodtoken  just watch out commatoken as this aptlynamed beverage will hit you hard if youre not careful periodtoken  some drinks to consider are the mixed beers commatoken which are like cocktails made from two of their brews combined together periodtoken  the sneaky redhead sneak attack and the irish red is fun to try commatoken but for my money i would go for the honey porter honey pale and their porter which really made a balanced rich and sweet tasting combo periodtoken  there are a couple barrelaged beers i was commatoken regrettably commatoken not able to get to this evening periodtoken  however commatoken there are two very intriguing spiced ipas which i highly encourage any customers to try out periodtoken  the beers are like a paired set commatoken one themed for spring and summer commatoken the other for fall and winter periodtoken  the summer is a combo witbelgianipa commatoken which tastes surprisingly light and sweet commatoken flavored with things like orange peel periodtoken  the autumn commatoken in contrast commatoken is a brownipa which is more robust and flavored with spices we normally associate with the colder months periodtoken  and if after enjoying a pint or two you want some beer togo commatoken then you can fill up some growlers commatoken or buy much of their beers in bottles commatoken which are also available in stores around town periodtoken  located in a converted warehouse in an industrial park off south longley commatoken know that if you plan on visiting parking can be a little tight commatoken as a lot of the spaces are reserved for some of the other businesses in the complex periodtoken  however commatoken i think if you are visiting after regular business hours commatoken you shouldnt have a problem periodtoken  once you walk in commatoken you can snag a place at the bar commatoken or at one of any number of tables commatoken benches commatoken or armchairs strewn about the room periodtoken  service is exceptionally friendly and attentive commatoken with a cool upbeat attitude periodtoken  if you need something to munch on while you drink commatoken the proprietors generously keep bowls of popcorn and peanuts constantly full on the bar commatoken as well as offering a few snacks for sale commatoken and having menus for the restaurant just a few buildings away commatoken should you want to walk over for dinner periodtoken  there are some bar games present commatoken and even a bbq if you want to bring your own stuff to grill up outside periodtoken  i am sorry it has taken me a while to circle back to stoneyhead periodtoken  it most certainly wont be another couple of years until next i stop by for a drink periodtoken  cheers commatoken guys","4642":"so good commatoken authentic commatoken and reasonably priced periodtoken  i have tried everything from tacos commatoken gorditas commatoken

so it was pretty crowded but we were able to get two seats at the bar right away periodtoken the service was super quick and friendly periodtoken i was very pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that upland offered periodtoken i had a difficult time choosing between their options which rarely happens at nonvegetarian places periodtoken they had a good mix of their classic beers along with their more experimental beers periodtoken","4651":"well commatoken its time i finally put my 2 cents in on this place periodtoken ive been wanting to yelp about this place for awhile but when i

pricey but big portions periodtoken enchiladas were awesome periodtoken salsa a lil bland but they added some habanero to of and was great periodtoken","4680":"i absolutely love the food here their speciality fries are all amazing but commatoken you should expect to be waiting at least 3540 minutes if their busy periodtoken having only two cooks commatoken one grill commatoken and tons of orders is a recipe for irritable customers and not a great place to stop on your lunch break in the city due to that periodtoken","4682":"my coworkers and i placed an order for capriottis periodtoken ive been to different capriottis locations before commatoken and have always had stellar sandwiches periodtoken my experience here did not disappoint my stomach periodtoken   in total we ordered 13

sandwiches are massive commatoken so luckily we had enough to share  the bobbie is a fanfavorite commatoken and my personal goto periodtoken it features homemade turkey commatoken cranberry sauce commatoken stuffing commatoken and mayo periodtoken it is basically thanksgiving in a sandwich periodtoken the bbq chicken salad is another one of my favorite things to order periodtoken it comes with a chipotle ranch dressing that literally makes you want to lick your bowl periodtoken  food 5 stars periodtoken missing food 1 star","4683":"i had not heard that nashville had a hot chicken truck until just a few days ago periodtoken  my boyfriend is a huge hot chicken fan periodtoken  so naturally commatoken this weekend when we saw that the hot spot was going to be at the wanderland nash food truck frenzy at elmington park commatoken we headed on over periodtoken  for nashville food trucks commatoken the prices are average with most meals around the 7 range periodtoken  where as most of the other food trucks had their bottled water and drinks for 1 commatoken the hot spot had theirs at 1 periodtoken50 periodtoken  all their drinks were 1 periodtoken50 whether it was a 16 periodtoken9 ounce bottled water or a 12 ounce can of pop periodtoken  probably best to check other food trucks for drinks periodtoken  on to the food commatoken i have a very weak palate for spicy periodtoken  so my boyfriend ordered the 2 piece twisted chicken with one with sriracha on it and one without periodtoken  and we also ordered some hand cut fries periodtoken  it took a little bit for the ladies in the truck who were taking the orderspayments to get everything completed with our transaction commatoken but by the time we got that taken care of commatoken our food was done periodtoken  the seasoning on the chicken is totally bomb  it is spicy by itself without their sriracha periodtoken  the inside of my lip tingled periodtoken  it was perfectly spicy for me periodtoken  and my boyfriend liked it as well periodtoken  he actually said he liked it better without the sriracha on it periodtoken  the chicken was fried perfectly periodtoken  the skin was crispy without being over breaded and was incredibly juicy commatoken tender commatoken and temperature hot periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenas well as spicy hot  i kinda wished that my boyfriend and i had not split the 2 piece order  the hand cut fries were pretty tasty delishus as well  we didnt get a dessert or try any of their breakfast items commatoken but they do serve the breakfast all day which i love places that serve breakfast all day  im a definite fan periodtoken  and if i come across a line of food trucks and the hot spot is there commatoken i will probably head straight to the hot spot periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenat least for the food","4685":"id imagine that if most people were asked in what part of town they enjoy the cuisine the most commatoken it would be downtown periodtoken but for me commatoken my favorite area for food is on orchard between emerald and franklin periodtoken time to score another one for the area periodtoken like orient market commatoken deli baguette is just barely off of orchard on franklin commatoken but close enough to merit inclusion for what i consider my favorite area for food periodtoken  the food in itself is not eyebrowraising spectacular commatoken but the basis for the recommendation comes in creating baguette sandwiches that are both solid and unique to the area periodtoken these are not your normal submarine sandwiches commatoken offering options like daikon commatoken pate commatoken and cilantro on freshlymade baguettes via the orient market that create a somewhat different and frenchinspired taste to the palate periodtoken i had the house special for my first sandwich when it was being served over at the orient market commatoken and i was hooked on my first try periodtoken as has been noted already commatoken these sandwiches are butt cheap periodtoken 3 periodtoken25 for the house special periodtoken  dont bother with the combo to get a soda and chips periodtoken youre not at subway commatoken and you can get that option everywhere else periodtoken i liked the pork and shrimp spring rolls which for some reason are not on the big menu behind the counter and the porkfilled pastries commatoken but be prepared to wait longer if none are premade periodtoken and hallelujah another place here sells boba tea now the selection is nowhere near as varied as yokozuna teriyaki commatoken but you do get better value for what is offered periodtoken  when ive visited commatoken the place has been at best moderately busy periodtoken as a result commatoken things have gone quite slow periodtoken as its still relatively new commatoken its hard to say if its because of them still figuring things out or being understaffed and overwhelmed periodtoken also somewhat odd is that you arent asked if the food is to be eaten there or not periodtoken seems like a bit of a waste if im sitting at a table and am handed my food in a plastic bag when i dont need one periodtoken tell them youre eating there if you arent asked periodtoken and they should invest in some trays itll keep the tables cleaner too periodtoken  they started offering pho commatoken but i didnt like it periodtoken  congrats to the owners for bringing something different to the area and not just opening up some other standard vietnamese joint periodtoken","4686":"went to pub and kitchen to eat some food and witness doc halladay

tend to get hot saki commatoken tempora commatoken sashimi commatokenthe spicy edamame which is amazing and roll number 15 periodtoken    the only complaint is that they lost our reservation for

location is close to us and i am a sucker for coupons we get in the mail every so often periodtoken periodtoken  not that im giving lame remarks to cover my snobby food attitude but you cant beat

knowledgeable commatoken whether im getting something  or  commatoken or just asking questions about something i can only afford to add to my wishlist for now periodtoken   ive only had them gift wrap my purchases a few times and commatoken unlike another reviewer here perspective dude first world problems commatoken im a little more forgiving when it comes to a free service periodtoken when its busy weekends commatoken holiday time commatoken weekends at holiday time theres going to be a big line commatoken and the people who stay in it are the ones who are going to get their things wrapped before the people who leave it behind for later pickup periodtoken at least commatoken thats what id expect if i continue to wait periodtoken if you ask commatoken theyll probably just give you paper to wrap it yourself though commatoken lord knows it will look like crap if i do it commatoken or you can go down the street to papyrus beautiful wrapping job commatoken but they charge

periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken  everything from here was tasty periodtoken   the baguette is good but not as good as others available around the city periodtoken  it is pleasantly chewy but very

close to work commatoken so i dropped in the other day for a sammy periodtoken my first thought was  its small it gets super crowded at lunch and is also small periodtoken i wouldnt want to eat in

a side street that is easy to park on and walk since its on the corner periodtoken   that being said commatoken companion has awesome bread and sandwiches periodtoken i love the cocktail party  brie commatoken apples and apricot marmalade on some sort of walnut bread periodtoken toasted periodtoken yum it doesnt come with anything but you can make it a bag lunch easily periodtoken the soups and

the foil they wrapped my sandwich in kept it really warm when i got to work and was ready to eat it periodtoken i also got a frosted sugar cookie commatoken which i didnt like much periodtoken the frosting was kind of gummy tasting and the consistency of the cookie wasnt great periodtoken that being said commatoken there are a lot of cool designs on them periodtoken   this is definitely a primo

downside the strip mall its located in periodtoken soooooo busy commatoken can never get a spot and even just dropping her off to run in to pick up the to go order was a hassle periodtokenactually a complete cluster periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken   i love the salads and will check to see if they are on uber eats to avoid the hassle getting in and out of the parking lot","4926":"loved the breakfast here periodtoken i dont think this place needs anymore good reviews because we were there on a cold morning in january and it was packed periodtoken in fact thats the only thing i didnt love about it  its a bit cramped and noisy and the tables are sort of crammed together in an effort to squeeze in as many eager diners as possible periodtoken i get it commatoken its the french quarter and most places are on the small side periodtoken but anyway periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenthe food was delicious periodtoken about as good a breakfast as youre going to find anywhere periodtoken a

","4928":"ive eaten here twice and was impressed by the food both times periodtoken  the first time i had the california blt sandwich and really liked it periodtoken  the portion size was big so i took the second half togo commatoken and when i ate it several hours later the bread was still pretty firm and not totally gone to mush periodtoken  you can add fries for 2 which i did commatoken and they were okay but i wish there were other healthier options periodtoken  maybe there were but i didnt see them on the menu periodtoken  ive also eaten their beet salad commatoken which i picked purely because of the ingredients listed on the menu truffled goat cheese commatoken toasted walnuts commatoken pesto drizzle commatoken and sherry vinaigrette  amazing am i right and didnt fully realize just how many beets were in this darn thing until it showed up periodtoken  it was still really good and i gobbled it down commatoken even though im not exactly a fan of beets commatoken but theyre supposedly wicked healthy for you and eating them drenched in cheese commatoken nuts and pesto is the best its gonna get  i have not tried any of their famous desserts commatoken so reserving the potential fifth star for them periodtoken  bottom line i work nearby so ill come back for lunch commatoken but i doubt id go too far out of my way to come here on a weekend periodtoken","4929":"ive had a lot of delicious mole in my life and the liverys mole on chicken was pretty flavorless periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken it tasted mostly just like cookedcharred

restaurant in town hoping the food is better next time periodtoken","4931":"hey kids commatoken did you know that vietnam was colonized by the french and when the vietnamese wanted independence the us supported the french who were still clinging to colonialism even after wwii periodtoken so the people seeking independence commatoken the viet minh commatoken got the backing of the commie people in china and anyone who was catholic or liked to eat french bread went south or eventually moved to the us periodtoken just kidding commatoken the commie people like french bread too periodtoken   and who wouldnt love baguettes crusty commatoken chewy commatoken great for sandwiches periodtoken just slap some pate on there along with some chili peppers commatoken cilantro commatoken pork products you have a masterpiece periodtoken what kind of creole fusion cuisine is this its the taste of two great culinary cultures in a mashup periodtoken  ive never been to the vietnamese markets in california so it was a treat to have this place open up in boise periodtoken the bread is baked at the orient market and it is excellent periodtoken im hooked on the house special with the pate and the jalapenos periodtoken kids might want to skip the hot peppers periodtoken  my daughter wanted to know why the menu said the sandwiches come with egg mayo periodtoken cuz dats what mayo is commatoken kido  an egg and lemon juice colloid periodtoken  the bbq pork is tasty periodtoken the chicken is so so periodtoken i have got to try the cajun shrimp periodtoken   speaking of cajun  the last time i had a beignet like they serve here i was in new orleans at cafe du monde periodtoken  actually these are kind of leathery and oily periodtoken kind of reminds me of the fusion asian grill  krispy kreme combo out in meridian periodtoken   so raise a glass of boba tea the thai tea is my fav and celebrate mixing things up periodtoken","4932":"not too sure why im reviewing a subway commatoken theyre all the same periodtoken it basically comes down to service periodtoken  this location is larger than most and has adequate seating periodtoken  the parking is cramped and really

of got 5 stars if i didnt have to tell you the master build for my sandwich periodtoken","4934":"sandwiches were okay commatoken mac and cheese was oily and had a funny taste to it periodtoken   im giving it 4 stars because nashville needs more deli options in general so 3 stars for the food and 4th star is for the fact that it exists as an option and it is better than panera and is open late so if you want a sandwich for dinner commatoken the hours are convenient periodtoken","4937":"unique donut flavors and delicious breakfast sandwiches periodtoken   district donuts is a quirky restaurant with yummy breakfast options periodtoken the donut flavors change regularly commatoken so dont get too attached to a specific flavor periodtoken   i have yet to try their sliders commatoken but have

clean commatoken friendly commatoken and rarely crowded periodtoken","4943":"i personally had only ordered the homicide boneless and regular and i absolutely love it periodtoken it is a bit pricey for the portion though but that doesnt stop me from getting my usual periodtoken but please be cautious if your tolerance level for spicy food is low because the homicide wings are extremely spicy but periodtoken periodtoken periodtokentasty lol","4944":"this is a pretty good place to get some breakfast food periodtoken  city limits is located a bit out of the way in bellevue commatoken as you have to drive into a neighborhood area commatoken and over the train tracks to get here periodtoken  however commatoken the somewhat isolated location its a random strip mall surrounded by suburban houses provides good parking spots periodtoken  its located very close to the train tracks commatoken so if you are sitting outside when the train comes by commatoken it might get a bit loud commatoken however there are only a few seats outside periodtoken   it can get a bit busy in the morning commatoken but the line moves pretty quickly periodtoken  the people seem friendly periodtoken  i wasnt blown away by friendliness in my few visits commatoken but i wasnt turned off by them either periodtoken  its a standard friendly affair i guess periodtoken   ive been here a few times so these reviews are based on a variety of visits periodtoken    onto the food vegetarian for the most part commatoken hence only vegetarian options discussed  tomato basil soup  probably one of the better soups ive had in a while periodtoken  i love the taste commatoken the consistency commatoken and the pieces arent too chunky periodtoken  i got takeout commatoken and they had it in a styrofoam cup that has an inside lid i dont know what its called commatoken but the lid if fitted inside of the cup instead of over it commatoken helping to keep more warmth in commatoken which meant my soup was hot even after a 15 minute journey home periodtoken  the soup comes with a bread that is allright periodtoken    california banini  essentially an egg and cheese bagel commatoken the sandwich tastes pretty good periodtoken  its better than the fast food options available in the area for sure periodtoken  i also believe the eggs were just egg whites commatoken i dont remember tasting egg yolk in the sandwich periodtoken   you do get a choice of bagels if you ask them periodtoken    egg and cheese croissant  pretty much a straight forward commatoken egg and cheese on a croissant periodtoken  you get a choice of eggs commatoken and i believe more topping if you choose commatoken but i didnt want it to be complicated periodtoken    vegetarian delight  a sandwich commatoken that i found to be disappointing periodtoken  its bread commatoken hummus commatoken cucumbers commatoken and onions periodtoken  it just doesnt stand out commatoken and the cucumbers tend to be the main focus of the sandwich periodtoken  tasted pretty bland to me commatoken since the hummus wasnt really standing out commatoken and the onions were few and far in between periodtoken    i think this is a good place to try out for breakfast commatoken but i didnt love their regular day options periodtoken  it seemed a bit flat to me periodtoken  the breakfast baninis end at 10 am periodtoken   i love the tomato soup here commatoken so thats probably going to be the one thing that brings me back periodtoken  the breakfast food is good enough that ill order it when im there periodtoken   ill recommend it to most people if they want to try a new place for breakfast periodtoken","4946":"first time at snola commatoken and i must say that the snowballs are incredible the cheesecake stuffed snowballs are

periodtoken  looks very new and crisp periodtoken  the counter has 25 cent candy to choose from as you would see in a traditional commatoken family owned commatoken mexican restaurant periodtoken  its a big place commatoken so bring your friends     while we waited for our food commatoken we feasted on the chips and salsa periodtoken yummy stuff  the menu is extensive with a nice lunch menu on the back periodtoken  i ordered 2 tacos one beef commatoken one chicken and they were both quite tasty periodtoken  the rice and beans were what i would expect periodtoken  nothing out of this world commatoken but definitely not bad either periodtoken  i should note the lunch menu is not available for the reduced price on sunday commatoken only mondaysaturday periodtoken    the wait staff is very friendly commatoken but it takes a while to get service periodtoken  we had to track someone down to take our order and drink refills periodtoken    we wanted to try the tres leche cake commatoken but they were out of it periodtoken  just gives me a reason to go back again periodtoken  i have a feeling i will be visiting often","4952":"this place is really good periodtoken lots of variety commatoken they had 3 different types of veggie burgers and a lot of topping options periodtoken i had guadalupe i think and it was amazing as is commatoken but even better with pickled jalape\u00f1o periodtoken everything had lots of flavor be careful with the build your own burgers though commatoken all the toppings and options can add up and get pricey periodtoken your better off ordering one of the ones already on the menu periodtoken overall really really good meal periodtoken","4953":"great place for a quick breakfast periodtoken if youre staying on canal do yourself a favor and walk down to this place periodtoken the staff is friendly and the serving sizes are hangover friendly periodtoken","4960":"i came here for lunch with a few friends periodtoken the place was packed

it toasted periodtoken there was a total of 10 in my group and we all received our food quickly periodtoken if i went back commatoken i would probably do the soup  sandwich combo periodtoken   for dessert commatoken i got the gooey butter cake periodtoken it was really good and a good sized portion periodtoken it was so large that i ended up sharing it with everyone in my group periodtoken  overall commatoken i would recommend this to others and go back there myself periodtoken","4962":"egg  cheese on onion bagel and hot tea periodtoken this is one of the better einsteins locations and the bagels are better than bread co periodtoken","4963":"moved over here not too long ago and was worried about the lack of decent pizza places commatoken and wasnt expecting much from foxs den after reading the reviews periodtoken ordered a deluxe though and was really surprised at how good it was its not going to blow your mind or anything commatoken but this is definitely a better pizza than you can get from the likes of dominos or pizza hut periodtoken had them a couple of times now and the pizzas were both well made and tasty periodtoken definitely recommend this place for anyone in the area periodtoken","4964":"maple street is not on my usual weekend path commatoken but ive stopped by this bakery the last few times ive been over that way periodtoken  delicious apple turnover commatoken almond croissants commatoken and cheese danishturnoverthingy periodtoken  i even bought my mom a thanksgiving cupcake with plastic turkey on top  old school periodtoken    my only criticism is i wish they had a true vegetarian sandwich on their lunch menu periodtoken","4966":"went with friends from out of state that had not been at a greek restaurant periodtoken food and service was good periodtoken food came out fast periodtoken bakery right there too was awesome and we purchased some things to take home periodtoken gyros were huge and other dishes had large portions periodtoken no

dessert commatoken we split scoops of pistachio and salted caramel ice cream periodtoken we made it a sundae chocolate commatoken whipped cream commatoken and nuts for 2 more  the premium mixed nuts on top made the up charge more than worth it periodtoken  service was topnotch periodtoken very helpful commatoken answered every question knowledgeably commatoken was around enough but not too much periodtoken  the only complaint and the only thing from keeping this a 5star review is the fact that they serve the burgers on cold buns periodtoken it got to the point where i started eating my burger with a fork to work around the bun periodtoken it looks like they bake them on site commatoken so im not sure why they wouldnt take the extra step to toast them before they serve you

lately trader joes and prices are a little better periodtoken they also always have more cashier lanes open than the other stores in the area commatoken so it takes less time to checkout commatoken if thats important to you periodtoken  the selection is good and its pretty wellstocked periodtoken i dont have to get rain checks here as often as i do at superfresh im primarily a sales shopper

friends and i originally went to the other location because it was closer to where we were periodtoken but to our disappointment commatoken the other location was closed and it told us to go to this location commatoken which was about a 1015 minute drive commatoken depending on traffic periodtoken we got there and saw that ted drewes is a historic tourist spot to visit on route 66 so we knew we were in for a real treat  the menu can be overwhelming especially since i wanted to try everything periodtoken with the help of the lady taking my order commatoken i narrowed down my choices and ordered the fox treat periodtoken and it was amazing periodtoken i really enjoyed the fresh fruits in my sundae but i think i wouldnt get the fudge next time because it became a bit too sweet towards the end periodtoken  my friends and i ran into a local as we were leaving and she said that this place is amazing and she has been going here once a month for as long as she can remember this place is

reveal what i could only hope was another awesome restaurant experience in downtown periodtoken    i could hardly wait for lunch on friday as i and several other coworkers embarked down olive to have lunch at this new establishment periodtoken we were promptly greeted and seated since we were veterans of the downtown lunch scene go early or dont go is the motto and looked over our choices periodtoken we were seated at the long table which is a new dining experience in itself since other parties can be and were seated directly next to hours periodtoken  this didnt bother me one bit but some of my coworkers were a little take aback by it and wanted to have some more space periodtoken  i ended up going with just the basic burger although the daves smoked burger and the black and blue sounded amazing commatoken i thought it best to just go with the basic for now periodtoken  i added the house cheddar sauce and a small order of fries with the house mayo periodtoken    looking over the menu there are a wide variety of toppingsadditions and sauces that you can pair with any of the burgers which means you never have to try the same combination twice periodtoken  also commatoken there is an expansive soda fountainesque menu for different types of soda or pop as it is called in some areas along with numerous different shakemalt concoctions that can be served with or without booze in them periodtoken  these drink menus made me think if crown candy and the chocolate bar ever got together for a one night stand commatoken this restaurant would be the result of that encounter periodtoken   the service was a bit on the slow side and i will chalk that up to the system used commatoken the sheer number of people who walked in after us commatoken and seating arrangement used in the place periodtoken while the decorative old windows that are suspended around the cooking and prep areas are very cool to look at commatoken i dont think it will be long before they are replaced with something less transparent periodtoken    back to the food commatoken my burger had arrived and it was cooked to temperature medium expertly periodtoken  the only thing i could fault with it was that the house cheese sauce is actually a sauce and not very thick so it had rolled off the burger and onto the plate periodtoken  i could barely taste it but the burger itself was flavorful periodtoken  the fries were great as well and i did enjoy the mayo that accompanied it on the side periodtoken  the chipolte mayo got the most rave reviews from the table though so it is something ill have to try next time periodtoken  we all agreed at the end of our meal that we werent overly stuffed or full but satisfied commatoken which was a nice feeling to have rather than feel bloated or miserable periodtoken  i think that is the feeling that will bring me back to this place in the future periodtoken","5048":"we went here to eat periodtoken well i was a little disappointed periodtoken

away quite impressed by not only the quality of the food but also of the service a small family run operation where everyone was more than happy to tell you about the recipes and heritage of each dish periodtoken  not well versed in greek food and actually not at all a fan of grape leaves or tzanziki the beauty of this menu for me was the more esoteric options such as the savory puff pastry and the sweets  the crepe and the galatopoureko particularly excellent id definitely revisit for breakfast or dinner commatoken particularly given the wonderful family atmosphere and bargain prices for food i generally do not go out of my way for  an experience both delicious and educational periodtoken","5062":"spoon me is my favorite froyo spot out of all the local chains  berry creamy in deptford and

trip to st periodtoken louis periodtoken it was tucked away in an industrial area close to downtown st louis which was interesting but most of these micro breweries these days are in some sort of industrial area of town periodtoken  it had more of an intimate vibe and the beers were great periodtoken i went on a friday afternoon so it wasnt too busy periodtoken  they had 8 of their own beers on tap and they allowed you to grab a flight of 4 beers for 8 dollars which was pretty reasonable judging by the 5 oz pours periodtoken unlike some places they actually allow you to choose your flight of beers which is nice periodtoken no one likes to be forced into beers they have no interest in trying periodtoken luckily i wanted to try them all so i got 2 flights of all their beers periodtoken my favorites were the milk chocolate stout and their single speed session ale  i didnt eat anything off the menu because our trip to 4 hands was preceded with a trip to pappys smokehouse but their menu looked packed with bar food from nachos to wings to pizza periodtoken it was way fuller than a lot of the micro breweries i went to on my trip periodtoken   i definitely recommend anyone to stop here if they are interested in the craft beer scene periodtoken","5107":"good food commatoken over the top atmosphere our waiter was great commatoken but on the two trips that i took two of my sons to

restaurant staff moves over commatoken after all you are their guest periodtoken the food is good but the prices are high and the surrounding restaurant are cheaper and presumably of equal quality

very good start periodtoken its surprisingly spacious inside and is very open commatoken bright and cheery periodtoken there also is a large outdoor bar and seating area commatoken and looks perfect for lunch or dinner commatoken or hanging out for hours with your friends periodtoken   we only had time for two beers and an appetizer commatoken but it was enough to view the menu loaded with

crab bisque periodtoken the bisque wasnt anything overly special commatoken but it was pretty good and i enjoyed it periodtoken i also got the des allemands catfish commatoken which was one of the lunch specials of the day periodtoken this was great a generous serving of tender catfish that was lightly battered and very tasty was presented with diced potatoes and green beans periodtoken the fish wasnt over cooked at all and the potatoes and green beans were a good addition to the meal periodtoken  service was good and the food came out quickly commatoken probably because there werent a

seated in the dining room or the courtyard periodtoken my friend and i were dressed business casual commatoken so we chose the courtyard commatoken making us feel less out of place and much more comfortable periodtoken the menu on the website still has my absolute favorite appetizer listed commatoken the smoked trout with garlic lemon aioli periodtoken periodtoken periodtokenand it is not on the menu there periodtoken again commatoken i was disappointed periodtoken hint to restaurant please update your website but commatoken fear not fans of the kirkwood location the food and service is

pita periodtoken i ended up dipping most of my fries in the feta cheese spreadsthat was yummy periodtoken  after this we were too stuffed for dessert but if youre a savage glutton you can get a ton of

and cookies stopped in earlier and picked up two vegan chai cupcakes to go and they were delicious the frosting is the best part of these cupcakes as it is not overly sweet and perfectly compliments

too salty periodtoken everything was way too salty in my plate including the corn periodtoken salt was allowed sadly to take over everything periodtoken the amount of salt attacked my palettes rather

americano commatoken which i hate periodtoken so i got a hot chocolate instead periodtoken i also got a ham and cheese croissant and a chocolatepeanutmarshmallow dessert bar periodtoken i liked everything periodtoken the hot chocolate was chocolaty and they put a generous mound of whipped cream on top periodtoken the dessert bar  ive already forgotten the specific name  was decadently good periodtoken periodtoken loaded with calories and flavor periodtoken its worth a trip there for that periodtoken i liked the croissant and i would get it again periodtoken it seemed a little old

the only difficult part to getting out here would be convincing my other friends that it would be worth the short trek from penns campus periodtoken always looking to explore affordable options outside of penns standard offerings commatoken i finally got a small group to come out to try the place on a slow weekend periodtoken  the vientiane has a small storefront located along a row of other

waiters and kitchen hummed along and the diners happily focused on their food and conversation periodtoken stepping in from the chilly walk and the proximity of the other tables certainly helped set the mood too periodtoken  luckily for us commatoken we came just in time to snag the last available table periodtoken promptly after we arrived commatoken a small line began to form outside

including the bill commatoken which came to roughly 15 per person allinclusive periodtoken for my first foray into laotian cuisine commatoken i was happy with the experience periodtoken compared to other asian cuisines commatoken there was greater use of mint commatoken cilantro and spices to bring out the flavor in the meat dishes periodtoken my favorite was the laab dish commatoken a warm

i could notice commatoken but im sure if i asked they would have showed me and it was a little loud in there periodtoken  but commatoken none of that would deter me from returning because the staff

normally great food chicken falafel periodtoken down sides when he started out around 10 years ago commatoken the sandwiches were actually reasonably priced at around 4 periodtoken now commatoken its 9 with a tip jar periodtoken  still commatoken the food is good and the experience is worth it at once periodtoken another down side is having to overhear the people blabbing away in line periodtoken","5176":"visiting tampa for a few days periodtoken this place was recommended by my sister periodtoken cool vibe commatoken great coffee and the gluten free brownie with coffee buttercream

sorts of tacos you would expect to see on a menu at a taco joint that are all pretty well done periodtoken for my money commatoken i still think las americas makes a better taco commatoken but this place is much more convenient to get to from where i live periodtoken i would not go here expecting a fancy dinner or the best ambience commatoken but if you are on the west side and in the mood for

are several excellent seafood markets in pinellas county commatoken harrs quality and selection make it a convenient stop commatoken especially if meat is the primary reason for the trip periodtoken they will happily clean shrimp for 2pound extra periodtoken overall commatoken their prices are extremely reasonable and comparable to the chain supermarkets periodtoken  they also have a full selection of wines and specialty items as well as deli and both fresh and frozen prepared foods made on site periodtoken this is definitely not a place to go when hungry periodtoken open the door and the aromas will beckon you to step in a little further periodtoken on initial glance commatoken it might appear to be any small market periodtoken once past the check stand commatoken a whole foodie

periodtoken but of course try a donut at least a bite periodtoken i ordered the monte cristo croquenut to go commatoken so lets see how it holds up in the middle of the night when i try it","5307":"had a wonderful dinner tonight periodtoken this was our first time here periodtoken our server was excellent and went out of her way to make sure we were satisfied periodtoken she had the kitchen prepared meals that were not on the menu periodtoken all the ingredients were fresh and delicious periodtoken it was the saturday before christmas but we were re not rushed periodtoken the only reason i didnt not give it five stars is because its my first time here periodtoken well see what happens in the future commatoken im sure ill make an adjustment periodtoken","5309":"i went to this mcdonalds for a family birthday party periodtoken my grandson wanted his 5th birthday party to be here and he loved it we brought a cake and many family and friends and it was just great periodtoken i even brought some of my hip hop students and we preformed a routine periodtoken the only thing that made me rate my experience 4 stars was while i was doing my hip hop routine some of the employees proceeded to laugh at me and my dancers periodtoken some even video taped me like cant you youngsters just let a 56 year old pop and lock with her crew","5310":"my husband and i came here to celebrate my birthday periodtoken we had been here during its prior incarnations commatoken but this was our first time at la tavola periodtoken  i was pleasantly surprised we came on a wednesday commatoken when they have their couples night out special 2 dine for 35 appetizer commatoken 2 entrees commatoken dessert commatoken and drinks periodtoken  we ordered frittura mista commatoken salmon livornese me commatoken veal sorrentino hubs commatoken and tiramisu periodtoken it was all so delicious  the ambience was pleasant periodtoken the service was great periodtoken my only complaint was that our server kept checking in on us every couple minutes it was a bit annoying periodtoken  massimo chef and owner stopped by our table before we left periodtoken i love being able to tell the chef how wonderful his food was commatoken and how much we enjoyed his restaurant  im so glad that smyrna has a nice dining establishment on its square","5311":"ive stopped by here a couple of times since their fairly recent opening commatoken both for dinner and just to get a couple drinks commatoken and i am impressed with this new place periodtoken it is a nice addition to the area commatoken and provides a dining experience that feels a little different than anything else around here right now periodtoken  first of all commatoken they did a great job with the space periodtoken there wasnt much of the historic building left to start with commatoken so it doesnt necessarily have a feel of an old historic place commatoken even though the history is interesting commatoken but it is an attractive space and has an upscale feel without being stuffy periodtoken its much larger than i expected it to be based on the original building periodtoken the hostess stand is downstairs with room around it to stand while waiting for a table its recommended to make a reservation at this point commatoken as there was an hour wait when we went on friday evening periodtoken they have a large downstairs bar commatoken along with a couple different seating areas periodtoken the separation of the space into smaller sections makes it feel a little more intimate and probably helps keep the noise down periodtoken upstairs is a slightly smaller bar with more tables and a couple booths to sit at periodtoken i am really looking forward to the summer when they open up the large rooftop section that you can only look at through the large glass windows now periodtoken   the main thing that stood out to me on both visits is the professionalism of the staff periodtoken i assume it helps that the owners of the restaurant have so many other businesses already commatoken but they were ready to go from day 1 and everyone we interacted with commatoken from the hostess to the bartenders to the servers commatoken have been top notch periodtoken  it is certainly a more upscale dining experience from the standpoint of the space and the service periodtoken  the bar touts the largest selection of tequila i have seen in quite some time periodtoken tequila is the liquor i am the least familiar with so i cant really comment about the bottles they have commatoken but you certainly have a lot of options to choose from periodtoken they also have a nice whiskey selection that is reasonably priced for the setting periodtoken their list of 8 or so house cocktails sounded amazing when their bartender expertly described each one to us commatoken and they had numerous ingredients in them that were my first encounters with periodtoken the beer list is only okay periodtoken they have a dozen things on tap that include some local standards and some national domestic craft things periodtoken there are more options in bottles and cans commatoken but it nothing too impressive periodtoken   the food commatoken while good commatoken didnt blow me away like other people seem to indicate periodtoken i felt like it was all good commatoken but relative to the price point commatoken it wasnt fantastic periodtoken the menu is fairly small commatoken but it does have a decent amount of variety periodtoken what it does offer is a unique selection of items that arent things you are going to find at many other restaurants periodtoken their menu is broken down into sections primero commatoken segundo commatoken empanadas commatoken ensaladas commatoken and dulce periodtoken as you can probably grasp from that commatoken it is a latin themed place periodtoken the dishes are tapas style so they are fairly small periodtoken our server recommended us to get a couple of items off of the primero and a couple off of the segundo section for a full meal for 2 people periodtoken we ended up with brussels sprouts commatoken patatas bravas commatoken chorizo empanadas commatoken and the pork pastor periodtoken everything was tasty commatoken but it wasnt anything that really felt exceptional periodtoken we finished everything commatoken and while it was a filling meal commatoken we werent close to needed a togo box periodtoken i think our bill for the food commatoken after tax commatoken was a little over 35 for the relatively lower priced options that we ended up with periodtoken thats a decently priced meal for things that i thought werent significantly impressive commatoken but it also wasnt too much to feel the visit was at all regrettable periodtoken there were certainly plenty of things on the menu that we wanted to get and had to pass on during this visit commatoken so i am sure i will be back again to try more periodtoken i foresee this being a great place to stop in and get one of their delicious sounding deserts late on a winter evening periodtoken  this is conveniently within walking distance of me commatoken so i didnt have to worry about parking periodtoken it is located on the cultural trail commatoken so it isnt hard to get to if you parked somewhere on mass ave periodtoken they do have valet parking that is available in front of the building on college ave periodtoken there are also some parking options along college ave if you can find an open spot periodtoken i dont recall if they actually have a small lot or not periodtoken  i will definitely be back to try more of their menu and to start making my way through their list of house cocktails periodtoken i definitely recommend this as a place to visit that provides a nicer atmosphere for dinner than a lot of the other options in the mass ave area periodtoken it would make a great date spot commatoken as it has a great ambiance commatoken fantastic service commatoken and is quiet enough to easily hold a conversation with the person across from you periodtoken im looking forward to my next visit periodtoken","5313":"this place is so popular on the weekends periodtoken the line moves pretty fast but get here early for seating periodtoken the donuts are large commatoken delicious commatoken and made inhouse from scratch periodtoken i will always be drawn to bourbon infused anything periodtoken  the sliders are good and the coffee is great for the area periodtoken it can get kind of smokey due to the open kitchen in the middle of the room and lack of ventilation periodtoken   flavors and items rotate so when you come in here commatoken theres likely something new to try periodtoken they keep the menu simple commatoken use quality ingredients commatoken and provide tasty options periodtoken","5319":"came here while attending the essence festival food was so good we came 2 mornings in a row i  would suggest getting the shrimp

perfection  with just the right amount of seasoning periodtoken the wait staff was also accommodating periodtoken the place is a bit small so get there early or there might be a wait periodtoken","5320":"my sister asked me if i was hungry at 10 pm and we were sitting in grand isle around 1030 periodtoken  i think they close at 11 pm periodtoken you can imagine how annoying this might be to the staff commatoken but we didnt detect a hint of annoyance periodtoken    im pretty sure our servers name was michelle periodtoken  she was phenomenal periodtoken  very kind and helpful periodtoken  my sister tends to ask 15 questions about one dish and then ends up ordering something completely different periodtoken  michelle if that was her name wasnt even phased periodtoken    i started off with the crab cake commatoken which was really great periodtoken  someone remind me to take pictures next time periodtoken  then i had the brisket periodtoken  it had a nice flavor and the presentation was cool periodtoken  they served it atop the lyonnaise potatoes with green beans periodtoken  it was moist and really tender periodtoken  overall commatoken it was well worth the money periodtoken  the entree was 18 commatoken i think periodtoken    for desert i had the no flour chocolate cake periodtoken  it was really dense almost a fudge consistency periodtoken  im a big fan of a flourless cake periodtoken  i also had some french press coffee periodtoken  the coffee wasnt the best i had ever had commatoken but it was very caffeinated and i do love that periodtoken  appetizer commatoken entree commatoken desert commatoken coffee and tip all came to 52 dollars for me periodtoken my sister and her husband were 86 for 2 alcoholic drinks commatoken new york strip commatoken a burger and desert periodtoken thats quite a bit of bang for your buck periodtoken  i will definitely be back periodtoken","5322":"it was my first time going to this place periodtoken the atmosphere is really laid back and relaxed commatoken the building used to be an old school laundromat and you can still see some remnants of it commatoken which i liked periodtoken the staff are super friendly and accommodating periodtoken the food is healthy and organic and they also have lots of vegan and vegetarian options periodtoken they are great with meeting your dietary needs periodtoken i had the cabbage hand salad which was a delicious salad wrap in rice paper periodtoken my only issue with the experience was finding a chicken bone in the wrap periodtoken","5327":"this place was exactly what i hoped it would be super cute commatoken with good food and great desserts periodtoken we got there on saturday around 1115am and had no wait at all commatoken but there was a line out the door by the time we left an hour later periodtoken i had seen the pickle soup on the menu and was dying to try it commatoken so of course i ordered that as my side to the roast beef sandwich periodtoken the soup was very pickley commatoken not lightly pickley commatoken but i loved it periodtoken roast beef sandwich was good  simple and served on tons of crusty bread periodtoken for dessert commatoken i had to try the pineapple cake in a cup with the chocolate almond joy ice cream periodtoken it was a dream in a cup a really really big cup periodtoken i would have eaten every bite if i didnt feel physically ill midway through from so much food periodtoken i would love to come back here and it was perfect for right before a matinee at the fox periodtoken","5330":"this store is so much larger than the speedway marsh periodtoken the vegetables and fruit are always fresh and i love the fresh flower selection periodtoken the meat department is extremely helpful so dont hesitate to ask a question periodtoken they will grind meat for you and butterfly pork chops if you ask periodtoken customer service commatoken cashiers and stock folks have always been courteous periodtoken the store isnt laid out as you would image so be prepared to ask for assistant or go insane wandering the store periodtoken not sure if the layout was experimental but much wasted space with isle layout forcing you to waste time crossing the store periodtokenworth the effort once your familiar with layout and isle since they carry more items than most marsh stores on the westside periodtoken they are great about opening extra cashier lines when the lines get long and they do during the normal crazy hours periodtoken","5331":"at first glance you see a small commatoken logcabinesque structure as you drive down main street in imperial periodtoken then it hits you what it is with the large sign in front of it and the cars in the lot periodtoken i cannot say enough about this place commatoken it usually has super fresh veggies at a reasonable cost along with other items that you can use with the veggies and fruits fresh breads too commatoken along with milk and dairy items the owners are helpful as well as those who work there as well periodtoken","5332":"i enjoy a good tea commatoken especially when i am about to get on the train or a plane and know i will be dehydrated for awhile periodtoken  the 30th street train station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks commatoken but i think this cosi rates periodtoken the service is always good commatoken the staff really is friendly and quick to serve they realize commatoken i think commatoken that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence commatoken and they accommodate your desires periodtoken  i was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side periodtoken now that is not something i can do at just any tea or coffee shop periodtoken    i will continue to use cosi when i am travelling through the train station","5333":"great place for bagels periodtoken  one of the absolute best  no puffy commatoken air bagels commatoken but good commatoken chewy ones periodtoken","5335":"wow compared to the runofthemill markets out in southern maine commatoken this place rocks so much more selection than shaws so many more brands than hannafords much much better

particularly upscale  what a hoot commatoken they have a  smoker outside selling barbecue commatoken awesome in the three times i visited this place commatoken i was never able to sample the que commatoken but the idea warmed my heart periodtoken the coolest thing of all they sell wine and beer commatoken open commatoken in the store commatoken so that you can get drunk while you shop how cool is that  they say one should not shop on an empty stomach commatoken imagine what you come home with on a drunken empty stomach even better commatoken it just gets better commatoken plenty of parking commatoken and both trader joes and whole foods are in the next parking lot periodtoken metro link is just around the corner too periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken makes me want

with wifi and plenty of outlets and a lot of room periodtoken it hasnt happened yet but someone opened one up in washington west which is totally not fair since good karma is an easy walk from the awesomeness of chapterhouse periodtoken  ill forestall my bitterness for now and just be glad that i can stop walking a whole two blocks than before if i really must be at a coffeehouse that much sooner periodtoken good karma is big and bright and has a lot of outlets and wifi periodtoken theres a large selection of baked good and drinks other than coffee and tea periodtoken thats cool periodtoken they have two nice bathrooms commatoken too commatoken and no one bothers you and theyre open late periodtoken could this be coffeehouse love  the downsides are the foods not great periodtoken theres a sign telling you not to bring food from elsewhere which i must respect but i must admit to being a little sad inside when i have to bite into one of their moist commatoken overly eggy scones knowing there are great ones out there made by our own metropolitan bakery periodtoken the coffees fine commatoken as far as a brew is concerned but as a fellow yelper said commatoken the lattes leave much to be desired periodtoken theyre confused as to what makes a latte and what makes a cappuccino periodtoken i ordered one once and none since periodtoken   but what can i say periodtoken ill take the bad scones and indifferent coffee drinks for the genuine friendliness of the place and my face is as green as their mugs when i think about how spoiled that neighborhood is while my part of town is totally bereft of coffeehouse awesomeness periodtoken  oh commatoken cash only though theres an expensive atm on the premises periodtoken","5338":"the atmosphere and decor are

at other stores will get you twice as much here i always find new items or brands that my family actually prefers over national brands their special buys section is awesome because i almost always find something that i need or had on my wish list for some time periodtoken   this store is my usual store even though another one is probably closer to me periodtoken i love the staff at this store periodtoken they are always friendly and helpful periodtoken if youre a regular like i am commatoken they will definitely recognize a familiar and friendly face the store is always clean and well organized periodtoken sometimes the special buys area can get a little out of hand commatoken but thats what happens when you have so much good stuff commatoken you run out of places to put it   aldi is actually a germanowned company so every year they feature german week with goodies actually brought in from germany i dont know that much about germany commatoken but i know they make some good stuff their produce section has a really good selection commatoken but just be aware that you wont find everything that other stores carry such as kale or other exotic items commatoken but very good

periodtoken like always i practiced my tongue skills on the stems until tied periodtoken","5367":"i was more than a little hesitant to try teavana after reading reviews of pushy salespeople periodtoken but praise be to yelp they mustve learned their lesson because i was here two days in a row with two completely different staff and while there was a lot of explainingdemoing there was no pressure periodtoken in fact today a wonderful salesperson dissuaded me from buying the overly expensive starter kit and rather get me a tea i liked commatoken  a tin commatoken  tumbler on sale please note this starter setup was half the cost of the actual kit  i was thoroughly impressed with the staff who were able to guess exactly which tea i wanted after i blankly starred at them and said i dunno i think its green tea based with fruit periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken even more impressive was the reassurance that you will know if you will like the tea simply by smell commatoken i didnt believe it but totally true periodtoken  cool note teavana was purchased by starbucks last year so those starbucks gift cards work here and if you have a registered card you can accrue stars here as well","5368":"mmmm periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken hashbrowns periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken what else can i say the food here was really good commatoken its a tasty

bacon commatoken egg cheese biscuit periodtoken 2 slices of nice crisp bacon and for once the chese is always melted  dont order just 1 commatoken make sure you get 2 or you will be too far away when

to the drink last year by a friend in denver commatoken where they are apparently all the rage periodtoken  village pub is the first place ive been to in nashville that seems to have caught the spirit of the spirit periodtoken  they use pewter mugs rather than the traditional copper mugs commatoken but the metal still gets frigid right down to the handle commatoken which makes it feel close enough to a proper mule for my liking periodtoken at 6 commatoken it is a wellpriced cocktail commatoken and they have several different variations if vodka is not for you periodtoken  for the mules alone commatoken i will be sure to come back to village pub periodtoken  other things they have going for them  1 a nice assortment of local beers periodtoken its hip to be local these days commatoken i know commatoken but these folks seem really committed to local periodtoken  for example commatoken on tap they have czanns brewery commatoken which is a oneman operation here in nashville from a

periodtoken as much as i like to think me and my guy make an unforgettable couple commatoken its more likely he is uncannily unforgetful periodtoken  i wasnt in the mood for an 8dollar bowl of pho it costs around 67 in our hood so we went with bun bi thit nuong 90 periodtoken it had the succulent vietnamese grilled pork we love in fact some of the best though i could do without the shredded pork periodtoken for spring rolls commatoken you cant go wrong with the same grilled pork and the clear dipping sauce they serve much better than the thick peanut sauce served in some vietnamese places imo periodtoken fried fish cakes were not bad commatoken especially drown in the sweet chili sauce periodtoken   to my disappointment commatoken they dont serve salted plum drink so i got a bubble tea in thai tea flavor periodtoken i wish i had ordered one made from fresh fruits since it wasnt the brewed thai tea in liquid form i expected but a mountain of blended ice and thai tea flavored powders

adventure to find them last sunday periodtoken  first of all commatoken if youre unsure of where the truck is commatoken be sure to check their facebook page just search food drunk food truck on google and its the first hit and they update daily with where you can find them periodtoken   alright commatoken so back to the burger periodtoken despite there being a parade going on commatoken there was no line at the truck commatoken so it was easy in and out periodtoken 10 for a king cake burger commatoken which ill admit looked fantastic gooey cheese commatoken piping hot commatoken etc periodtoken  so commatoken heres my criticism man commatoken a king cake burger tastes a lot like a king cake burger periodtoken i dont know what i was expecting commatoken but yup commatoken thats king cake and a burger periodtoken   dont get me wrong commatoken the meat was fantastic commatoken there was tons of delicious cheese commatoken and completely separate from the burger commatoken i guess the king cake wasnt bad periodtoken together though man commatoken i dont need sprinkles on my burger commatoken ok  i dont really know what could make this better for me periodtoken maybe if they did some sort of sauce on the burger that married the two flavors commatoken but as is commatoken the whole thing is kind of jarring periodtoken or maybe im just a boring eater periodtoken who knows periodtoken","5714":"recently stopped here to check the new brewery out periodtoken as we arrived commatoken we found they only had 4 parking spaces and then signs that said to not park on the

promptly and ordered a flight of everything they had periodtoken it was a mix of sours commatoken ipas commatoken and stouts for the most part periodtoken all were at or above average commatoken

very friendly and influenced my selection of the variety of beverages periodtoken  although the food may not be fine dining experience commatoken the samosas provide adequate sustenance to tide one over until dinner periodtoken","5718":"range is one of the newer additions to downtown commatoken and once again commatoken the folks behind places like baileys chocolate bar commatoken bridge commatoken and rooster hit it out of the park periodtoken they are my favorite restaurateurs in the downtown stl area  even though each place is very different in niche commatoken cuisine commatoken hours commatoken decor commatoken each has the impression of being well thoughtthrough for what it is periodtoken  so commatoken what range is  a modern update of the soda bar  rollerskatewearing carhop burger joints of yore periodtoken no commatoken you dont pull up in your car and get served by comely ladies in skates commatoken but the food is pure americana burgers commatoken fries commatoken shakes commatoken and floats periodtoken except did we mention boozy shakes and boozy floats yes periodtoken i would put on my bobby socks for these periodtoken  the  interior is dominated by a large barheight table that runs the length of the restaurant commatoken with stools for seating we should add there is also a barheight bar that runs the length of the restaurant commatoken parallel to the table  periodtoken perhaps a bit offputting to the standard middleamerican diner commatoken who seems to prefer maintaining a certain distance from gasp other people commatoken but we found it charming periodtoken came in on a superbusy friday night but nonetheless had maybe a 10 minute wait for a spot for 2 which was just right for ordering drinks at the bar periodtoken  the burger menu includes many inventive takes on the classic commatoken and it seems you can substitute different kinds of patties pork commatoken chicken commatoken bison commatoken lamb commatoken veggie for the freerange cow patties if you so desire some burgers appear to be crafted around the type of meat involved commatoken so sub at your own risk periodtoken we went exotic with the pbj bison with arugula pesto commatoken goat cheese commatoken and tomato jam and the smoking duck burgers  the former was just periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken do it periodtoken you will not be sad periodtoken the duck was ok  nothing wrong with it commatoken but in comparison to the pbj it was a little boring periodtoken you should just order two sides of fries rather than one large  costs less commatoken plus you get to try more sauces periodtoken the rooster is the same spicycreamy sauce served on top of the crepes at the rooster commatoken and the homemade catsup was just fine periodtoken havent tried the others yet periodtoken  the big winner commatoken though commatoken is the boozy horchata milkshake an invention that should have come to be long before now periodtoken you will somehow make room for it commatoken we promise periodtoken  they have a fun survivorstyle competition where each week commatoken two burgers face off in a battle  the one that gets ordered more gets to stay on the menu periodtoken should keep things interesting over time  great idea for nom longevity periodtoken","5721":"as others have said commatoken great place to set up with your laptop or

sprite tasted like alkaseltzer  it was so nasty i dumped it out and thought what a waste periodtoken this time the one topping looked better than the pie of the week spring pie  was supposed to have cilantro and salsa commatoken definitely was no cilantro and very little salsa periodtoken  why do ya skimp on the toppings when you charge nearly 2 per extra if i get skimped on one more time im going back to papa johns they always load it down with toppings periodtoken  i like pepperoncinis and hate tootsie rolls anyway lol go ahead make my day","5765":"good resturant that i frequent

craft and pretentious goods commatoken but they also have velveeta shells periodtoken  the prices seem high but then im not sure what free range bison steaks should cost in a downtown grocery

this particular location can get real gritty real fast periodtoken the minimal seating area may have trash left on it from inconsiderate customers periodtoken andor trash may be found on the floor

mini pastry periodtoken mmmmm  for drinks we had a water and a coffee periodtoken the coffee was promptly refilled commatoken the waitresses had good attitudes periodtoken   one thing that cracked me up was their descriptions on their menu periodtoken it frequently said this is great or best blah blah in town commatoken the best or so yummy it just sounded like an afterthought commatoken like oh we should put canned positive words and phrases so people order this periodtoken a more authentic way to boast would be having the servers pick a favorite dish and putting so and sos favorite breakfast or like what squeeze in does commatoken have a legend where a symbol represents most popular dishes periodtoken i frequently ask servers for their recommendations so im not opposed to what they wrote per say commatoken but it made me chuckle periodtoken  will continue going here periodtoken we enjoyed our visit  anyway commatoken enjoyed our meal here periodtoken","5983":"really enjoyed

well periodtoken the grits arrived first and since i wasnt in the deep south i assumed the grits would be okay periodtoken i was surprised by them commatoken the consistency of it was creamy but not too creamy where the grittiness of the hominy could still be felt periodtoken   the omelette was more like a cheese foldover with the toppings sprinkled over it periodtoken i was expecting it to be mixed into the eggs but it was still tasty periodtoken i think i preferred it like this here because i could really taste the freshness and spiciness of the jalapeno and the sausage looked liked finely minced patties and not links commatoken again a nice surprise with how it was presented and they were seasoned quite nicely as well periodtoken  the omelette was served with a short stack of pancakes so i did get to sample their pancakes periodtoken i reiterate that i am not a sweet foods breakfast person but i was impressed with their pancakes periodtoken light and fluffy commatoken and

and ive never had to wait more than 5 minutes to check out periodtoken  they dont charge for bags  yay and they dont make you use a stupid discount card to get a club price which makes me bonkers

burger periodtoken glad i did so commatoken as there were plenty of fries for two of us the burger tasted delicious commatoken and i can guess that those burgers are the reason people return here periodtoken   tip the burgers are skinny commatoken so go for the double burger so you get a healthy mouthful with each bite  we noticed the soda dispenser was well used commatoken and that there was a strange pile of ice in the drainage area like a mountain of ice periodtoken we mustve come at a high usage time periodtoken  i wouldve loved to have tried the custard dessert commatoken but given our luxurious commatoken audacious quantity of fries commatoken we opted out of any dessert for our own well being next timeand we will go again periodtoken it was fun and friendly commatoken even

drinks are lower than more corporate coffee shops hubbard and cravens commatoken starbucks commatoken ect periodtoken  coffee is selfserve commatoken just drop your cash into a slot and pour yourself a cup periodtoken personally commatoken this is a huge bonus for me periodtoken it builds a lot of rapport between me and a business if the owners dont assume ill rob them of 2 worth of coffee if theyre only stupid enough to give me the chance periodtoken  overall commatoken monon is one of many fantastic coffee shops in indy periodtoken the lower prices for lattes around 3 periodtoken50 for a 16 ounce make it better than most for frilly drinks and the selfserve coffees are excellent periodtoken its probably worth noting that monon doesnt really do flavored coffees commatoken or at least commatoken not at the self serve periodtoken if youre into that commatoken youll probably want to head somewhere else periodtoken","6160":"best tex mex in the metro periodtoken periodtoken periodtoken

addressed the problem commatoken head on commatoken they fixed most but i am not sure they fixed them all periodtoken   first commatoken they built an indoor and outdoor parking lot periodtoken however commatoken these are always packed and it is always a struggle to find a parking spot periodtoken when it is very crowded workers have to direct traffic periodtoken one time commatoken a small
