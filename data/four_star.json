interior and owner  gave us tour of upcoming patiorooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today cheese curds were very good and very filling really like that sandwiches come w salad esp after eating too many curds had the onion gruyere tomato sandwich wasnt too much cheese which i liked needed something elsepepper jelly maybe would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails next time i will try one of the draft wines","5":"i was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one i love the 96th street naked tchopstix so i was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house the vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area you order at the counter and they deliver it my daughter and i tried the sushi bowl you pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins vegetables rice and toppings i like the fact that it is on paper and you dont have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want the sushi bowl was good but not wonderful the choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and i felt i had more rice than other food items the sauces were tasty my husband ordered the maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard it was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street i would go back though and i think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls i do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service people  it is a sushi place  it isnt mcdonalds so it will be a bit slower you are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express as a healthy alternative to fast food in the area it is worth the wait oh and try the bubble tea i had the strawberry and it was quite yummy next time i am going to try the vanilla chai","8":"after my rotd  yesterday of a different sweet ceces location i realized that i had never reviewed my local source  anyway i love the product  love love love  and i usually like their selection of toppings  good mix between healthy and notsohealthy  sometimes the girls working there arent really paying attention or are nowhere to be found  sometimes you have to remind them of their deals like 5 friday  but i cant give it less than 4 stars because i just love it so much","10":"food was good atmospheredecor is like a fishing lodge menu is someplace between outback  bonefish went on a groupon  all 3 of our meals  calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly we will def be back","11":"i love the brewpub for their variety of dishes  nachos pizza and sandwiches  variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight    every time we go the service is slow  i think its just the pace of the restaurant  its never a quick beer and a bite of food  instead enjoy the patio and friends savor that time    kid and dog friendly environment  also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends    my go to is a half order of the nachos or fish  chips    tried their pumpkin seasonal beer and its on par with some of my favorite pumpkins","21":"id you havent been to the smoothie king center since it was know as the new orleans arena you are in for a nice surprise the arena has had a face lift and while the seats are the same  everything else has been refreshed     most importantly  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes  the quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back the drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars spiked lemonade  bottled and draft beer and of course smoothies  there is even a spot for sweets you can get funnel cake cotton candy and all kinds of delicious things i was too full to take in    the venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch  we are moving on up","22":"dont know what it is but if my tummys feeling icky i can count on chipotles stake to fix me up i just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time i usually go between 2  4 when its peaceful and calm busy or not the service is always friendly and fast","24":"looks like there is a second red kings restaurant in chinatown and it did not disappoint since this place just opened yesterday im not exactly sure if its replacing the other red kings down the street or if it is just a second helping of spicy szechuan food  we ordered takeout and picked up the dan dan noodles and a shredded pork in garlic sauce dish the spice level in both dishes was perfect  extremely mouthburning but with delicious flavors that were sweet earthy and fresh the portions were very generous and will make for great leftovers for us i cant wait to try some of the other dishes and come back here for a sitdown dinner they also have karaoke rooms upstairs plus they are byob","30":"came in after attending the zurich classic golf tournament it was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone i lucked out and found a parking space on the street the interior is quite cute and comfy  the selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors i went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone the ice cream hit the spot and i enjoyed it bc it wasnt overly sweet  creole creamery was definitely worth checking out","38":"the espresso here is excellent my favorite place to come for an americano the staff is polite and friendly and vibes are mellow it is important to know that there is no access to power outlets but unlimited wifi access the bathrooms and the rest of the establishment are always clean","44":"cute lil spot on germantown ave i came in craving something sweet and they did not disappoint there was an array of cookies and bars to choose from if my memory serves me right behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess labeled cake scrapple i was intrigued they were different kinds of cakes and icings most likely left over from a bake there were about 5 different flavors to choose from and i went with my favorite red velvet with cream cheese frosting i also ended up with an mm cookie my other fave it was a nice day so i sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness the cookie was great soft  chewy with those hard candies for texture the cake was also delicious and moist","48":"underrated burger alert  randomly came into pags during a stroll around doylestown the menu wasnt super appealing actually so i just went with a cheeseburger legitimately one of the best cheeseburgers ive had in a while tasted like a quality big mac patty wasnt too thick bun didnt overshadow the burger and whatever sauce they used  yum  we were in the wine bar section  ambiance is really nice def not very kid friendly we had our son with us but staff was friendly and accommodating  we will totally be back next time we are in the mood for a good burger","51":"this is a convenience store deli so dont expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service thats the only reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 ive had a cuban press one time and a breakfast sandwich at another time sandwiches are prepared upon your order and i was very happy with the food delicious there are some tables inside and some outside on the dock overlooking ocean there is a more popular breakfast place maggie maes in the same strip mall but tastewise i must say i like this deli much better","54":"i went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there the beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind","59":"thank you for a lovely morning  i was in nj early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast  i got a taylor ham egg and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes i simply couldnt decide between sweet or savory plus leftovers are never a bad thing    the egg sandwich was fantastic  i was nervous when they said they didnt have kaiser rolls so i went with a hamburger roll  it was an excellent decision  the roll was excellent  not just an average cheap hamburger roll  they layered the cheese on the sandwich which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich  it was served with home fries which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions  im not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan but these were great and i appreciated that they didnt clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of precooked home fries  the pancakes were great and fluffy  my one gripe was their use of smuckers prepackaged syrup  i realize that if they put syrup in a container it probably wouldnt be real maple syrup but i sort of wish i didnt know that they were giving me subpar syrup  the server was friendly and very attentive  the coffee refills were constant and the coffee was actually good so many diners fail at coffee  bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts  all around i loved this place and hope to go back soon  long live the jersey diners","68":"this place is amazing the pizza cookies are a must it came hot soft and crazy delicious   we tried the peanut butter pizza cookie and the oreo cookies and both were perfection im very eager to try other flavors also being open until 3am is the smartest decision of any bakery in america   the only reason im not giving a 5 is because of the prices but to be honest those late nights when all i want is a fresh baked cookie pizza id be willing to pay 50","76":"we randomly decided to look for middle eastern food came up with petra restaurant near our home tried it with my family and liked it quite a bit try their friday and saturday special rice it actually test like indian fried rice with lamb really tasty other things are very good too dont be discouraged with the location of the place but food is good and inside of the restaurant is quite nice service is good too","77":"i stopped in because i was hungry for some snacks  browsed the store since i had some spare time and found it to be clean and well stocked  wide isles good selection of bakery stuff flowers and all your usual groceries i like that they had some locally made snacks too like california kettle corn and taco works out of slo  found the semiunusual chips i wanted that other stores dont always carry grabbed a diet coke by the checkout and i was happy  convenient parking lot and the staff was friendly and helpful  thanks albertsons","79":"this was such a unique spot from the graffiti style art on the walls to the delicious food options and special hummus flavors good prices great portion size i had the greek steak pita with guac hummus will definitely be back","80":"i really like prep  pastry  we have been twice in the last two months on a sunday  the best trick i learned is to put your name on the waitlist before you arrive  as long as you are within 5 miles of the restaurant you can be added  it is a great service  i have tried a number of things for brunch and all have been excellent  even their sweets i think my favorite is the breakfast sandwich  i am not a big drinker so i usually order the ice team and it really is better than almost anything else i have tried   staff is really really nice  i highly recommend a visit if you are in town","82":"a great spot to take outoftown guests i take all my chicago friends here and they fall in love the burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other the first time i had horchata shake i honestly had dreams about it for like a week its also super centrally located a quick walk from wash ave and other downtown attractions great vibe although i always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor  the burger selection is really really great you can pretty much get whatever your heart desires ive had mac n cheese patties on my burger you can get a bison burger turkey burger literally anything i have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations the waiters are always super honest in a good way if you ask them whats better x or y theyre not going to jerk you around and say theyre equally good theyll give you their honest opinion love that   another unique aspect about baileys range is that they have a burger showdown cant remember their technical term for it where last weeks featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe its a cool callout that you dont see at a lot of other restaurants   the only reason i gave it a 45 star instead of 55 is because ive had a couple of instances out of many visits so its really not alarming or anything where i requested my burger medium or mediumrare and it turned out a little well done i still ate it but it wasnt really what i expected","85":"the flavors continue to surprise me i had bananas foster pear champagne sorbet blueberry fig sorbet and cassis sorbet all flavors were good but the cassis started off quite subtly and then the flavor gradually made itself known the more i ate of it the better it tasted it was well worth coming back with another group of friends to sample some frozen happiness","88":"weve been shopping here since this location was a wild oats perhaps im just imagining things but id swear it has gotten better since the merger of these two chains  i love the produce seafood and cheese here but its the personal care section with tons o natural cosmetics handmade soaps and the like that brings us in most often well that and the salad bar in the cooler months nothing beats hitting whole foods for a postyoga lunch of soup and salad or the deli salad sampler plate the carrot ginger split pea and corn chowder soups are the best other sure bets the curried tofu salad or pretty much any of the delimade tofu items sushi togo boxes and the everything cookies my most recent find lavender soda  kinda dry and really does relax you ","100":"hendricks is a must try in stlouis the meatssaucesand sides are better than most barbecue placesonion rings are huge and the coleslaw is tasty and finely shredded service is good and very friendly takes awhile to get the mealbut it gives you time to check out the unique decor","106":"the burgers were very good very flavorful i had the el mariachi as with what other reviewers have said the portion is not big but i believe it makes up in flavor i also have salted caramel ice cream it was very good homemade style i do recommend the rooster sauce","107":"just had a late dinner there on a sunday night and was really surprised at how good the sushi was and how low my ticket was i had a plate full of sushi and it cost me 1300 the staff seems to be having a good time too very friendly place i really enjoyed it and will be back soon","118":"drumroll please review 100 coming right up   i chose to review starbucks as my 100th review because it is a guilty pleasure something that i only allow myself once a week but something that i crave everyday   this particular starbucks is great the baristas are always friendly and welcoming the drinks are made correctly and quickly i usually go with a salted caramel hot chocolate or mocha i also occasionally order the white mocha if you cant tell i enjoy coffee that doesnt taste like coffee in the summer their iced teas are the perfect thirst quencher their breakfast pastry items are always delicious try the cranberryorange scone and you will not be disappointed their breakfast sandwiches are unique and pretty tasty as well  i always choose to go in and place my order over sitting in the drive thru the line for their drive thru is always ridiculously long its usually quicker to go in","124":"my partner and i split the vegetarian platter and left stuffed delicious food very kind and attentive staff  will help you make decisions on ordering and certainly wont take advantage of you will definitely be back","125":"pancake pantry is an institution in nashville a place to see country stars and have a great breakfast pancakes are good its a thing to do in nashville plan to stand in line and enjoy the conversation","129":"after driving pass all the seafood restaurants around clearwater beach i knew wanted seafood right there and then i wasnt familiar with the area and did not do any yelping before hand so was pretty hesitant to just blindly pick a restaurant  finally after a long day at the beach we made a quick walk across the street to all the restaurants and thats when we stumbled into crabby bills we ordered the 25 bucket of steamed seafood it was decent not necessarily the best fresh seafood this was just a quick snack that i shared with one other person to keep us going before our big dinner at berns steak house that we had reservation for a couple hours later","130":"my boyfriend and i decided to stop by for lunch yesterday and i am so glad we did i ordered a side of beans chips and salsa and guacamole he ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice the beans are hands down my favorite ive had from a mexican restaurant  my only complaint is that unfortunately you do not get a very big portion the salsa is so fresh tasting and deliciousvery cilantro forward and the chips were nice thick and crunchy without being oily at all take note though chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately now let me get to the best partthe made to order chunky guacamole the hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac but i opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa the hot sauces were anything but though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons while i had a great eating experience my boyfriend did not he said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless he did say he would give it another shot though","133":"i love the concept of this place one half of it a caf\u00e9 that serves different types of coffees and teas and breakfast type items and the other world where it serves bar type apps salads and sandwiches  cant forget that they also serve a wide variety of beers that they serve on tap bottled or in can    this place is pretty darn casual and one can hang out here for hours with their friends  reminds me of the good ol college days when no time could pass especially on a chill out sunday fun day  bring your four legged friend too  they are totally welcome","134":"after moving to the area jungle prada tavern was one of the first places a friend took me  the bartender made a great recommendation based on a beer i told her i liked and i loved it  now for the food i love seafood so i am leary of ordering from places that dont do it justice but alas they impressed me thoroughly with all the seafood options i chose  the scallops prosciutto app del mar pizza with crab and scallops and crab stuffed portabella app comes with a crab and lobster bisque yum are all delicious  i also love the roasted portabella app for a vegetarian option it is delicious and was recomended by someone who isnt ive actually gone back several times since then just to eat obviously i also drank  and took my sister when she was in town visiting and is a seafood fanatic  so all in all give this place a chance  you will not be disappointed with the options","136":"if you like onion rings order them here some of the best i have ever have i also had a reuben which was very good also","146":"walked by this place and decided to check it out great beer and burger place made even better knowing many things were organic you can order from the menu or create your own burger they also have rotating beers and specials nice atmosphere and staff burgers dont come with anything so order from the sides if you want some fries theres also sandwiches and salads if you dont want a burger vegetarian friendly","150":"we stopped here for my chai and hubbys coffee and caffeine mania the line went quite fast theyre quick with the service especially not a lot of people at the time my chai came out good awesome one thing i forgot to do is to purchase more coffee for the house they have lots for sale but not too worry because we still have plenty of starbucks coffee at home what would life be without starbucks","158":"ive only been to their casino and i love that its only an hour away from orlando yet it feels so far the atmosphere is typical of most casinos with the exception of over priced burgers and fries at the hard rock cafe   i had some luck on the breakfast at tiffanys slot machine and as a lover of the movie it was a fun one to play","167":"great bagels  i wish they stayed open later in the day though  staff not very friendly but the bagels are worth it","170":"on my first day in new orleans i walked to fair grinds for a caffeine boost it was a beautiful afternoon and a handful of people were scattered around the shop and the outdoor seating area working on laptops and visiting with friends   i ordered a small cold brew with vanilla easy on the ice i added a hunk of gluten free zucchini bread the bread butt the best part to my order and paid with a credit card they have a fancy touchscreen register that lets you add tip to your card purchase   i topped off my drink with whole milk  which in itself was a real treat its so rare to see whole milk at the mixing station   before leaving i asked what else they had in the way of a gf offering and the young man behind the counter said just the zucchini bread thats a real bummer the zucchini bread is great but id love to have more than one option   my drink was smooth and had a perfect flavor i was happy with my choices   if i lived in the neighborhood id be here all the time i like the hipstery feeling of this place and everything ive ordered has been delightful","173":"i loved this place  we drove down from tahoe just to eat here  the 90 miles round trip was worth it  the food was that good  the chicken basil was the best  and they have good boba tea  dont believe the naysayer about this place  the food was pretty authentic taiwanese  try it and see for yourself","177":"smokey to be expected  minus a star as a non smoker with allergies several dining options prices varies beverages all sorts for a nominal fee of course hotel pricey parking free entertainment various atm scared for some people who may not have self control and yes gambling tip dont gamble if youre bit willing to lose it have fun even if you are an observer like me","181":"tasty selection and very preppy   one cannot go wrong with the whats up doc omelet one complaint with the omelets is the actual size they seem to fluctuate clearly a difference in 45 extra bits worth of omelet   if you have a sweet tooth any of french toasts are great fancy breakfast sandwich is great i substituted the prosciutto with bacon and got great results great mimosas","185":"food was fresh and tasted great nothing amazing but price was fair and staff was very helpful and nice","190":"i used to go here all the time for the lunch special and it was a great deal weve been only a few times in the last year because my husband isnt a fan but i enjoy it the prices do seem to have gone up a fair bit in recent times but its still never a disappointing meal","193":"i ordered delivery online through yelp and the food took about 45 minutes to get to my door the delivery driver was friendly i ordered a bbq chicken pizza and it was really good they spread the good stuff out over top of most of the crust which was awesome i also ordered mozzarella sticks and they were not really what i was expectingthey werent breaded they were deep fried they were good just not what i was expecting they also gave me two free cookies with my order and i have to say they were so good they were a little undercooked so they were perfectly chewy and they were almost the best part of my meal and a nice little surprise the price was fair and i would order here again for sure although the wait was a little long","196":"the honey apple grilled cheese sandwich is totally to die for i never been more happy to eat a grilled cheese sandwich in my life the staff is friendly the decor is cool and hip and the food is great the meltdown in montgomeryville does not compare the service is rude and the decor is too futuristicweird i had my server throw my sandwich at me and splash another customer with soup at montgomeryville regardless of then other shops i love meltdown it really helps a cheese lover out","203":"had a great dinner at spasso my parents always request oana and she is an awesome server answers questions gives suggestions and really knows the menu we were quoted an hour wait but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait they are full service  spasso is italian but has its own little spin its not just the classic dishes of a typical italian restaurant  they start you off with bread and this delicious eggplantpepper topping that is so refreshing i typically love oil for bread but love this alternative  i started with a caesar salad which was perfect just enough dressing super fresh and i love the shaved parmesan on top for dinner i had pappardelle porcini which i think is the best item on the menu it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes mushrooms and chicken with light sauce it is totally delicious and i had leftovers to have for lunch the next day  spasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in media","213":"i definitely preferred the pizza from nabruzzi but enzos is still a good take out option in the area i recommend their meatball sub and garlic knots the meatballs taste homemade and of good quality well continue to get food from here but i do wish they would still offer the pizzas they had when it was nabruzzi","220":"beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to nola with the girls we stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at cochon review to follow sweet confections is on magazine st around corner from the art gallery strip on julia st   we had a sampling of cupcake chocolate with mocha filling and truffles raspberry creme brulee and orange  cupcake was good mocha filling best part rasberry truffle was my fav love the dark chocolate so its not cloyingly sweet the coffee was a wonderful chaser not overly burnt smoky or acidic i usually have coffee with milk n sugar forgot this time but i didnt even need it  seating was nice with a few cafe tables inside enough for our 6girl troop and service was great helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling  gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person","224":"standard jimmy johns fare nothing especially good or bad about this one restaurant was very clean","226":"my friends and i all got one of each that were available to try out i love the many fun donut flavors they have there the thing that stood out to me was their fried chicken i got the chicken sandwich and it was so good i highly recommend it","227":"pricey  a ham and cheese croissant was 550  as with anywhere in santa barbra but very delicious cute space  a bit hard to find  the green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for  10 i think the santa barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent cold brew coffee was good lots of good choices in the grab and go section and our salami and pesto sammy was also great id go back","238":"dont let the outside fool youthis place is much cuter and nicer inside than you would expect   food is good and reasonably  priced we ordered papaya salad triple flavor duck and king tofu soup papaya salad is always refreshing but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice i would say their king soup with choice of protein is a winner   and also byo","239":"really great place for wine  came here with my dining group there was about 20 of us on a friday for their happy hour excellent wine happy hour where all glasses are 5 or you can take 5 off any bottle of wine which is a great deal if youre sharing with a few peoplegreat way to try a few bottles  the food was also great cheese plates are the way to go here excellent selections several of my foodie friends ordered sandwiches which looked  smelled amazing they all raved about them  the ambiance is very warm and inviting they do a great job decorating especially around the holidays my favorite space is the enclosed patio area adjacent to the main dining area super warm and romantic on those cold winter evenings   the service is great as well","248":"i think this is better than the philadelphia location nevertheless szechuan house in hamilton nj is still the best","250":"this was mine and my fianc\u00e9s first time eating here because it not only just opened up but i got a coupon for a free pizza so why not right  we werent blown away with the experience or the pizza but liked that it was fast and efficient the staff that made that pizza was very friendly but the cashier wasnt sharing that same enthusiasm   wouldnt drive out of my way to go here but if we are in the neighborhood and feel like some pizza we may go back","256":"i have visited the brewpub several times now and im finally ready to write up a review  i really like the decor here  its oldschool brewpub with lots of games for children  the beer is pretty good  i wish they would do some more adventurous offerings but i can still get a good beer here   the food can be a mixed bag  i had a small pizza that was a gooey mess mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability  i love all the scotch egg offerings you can get it on a pizza or burger here but they are so salty  the burgers are good the desserts are great please get the frangipane  its also great to get the ploughmans plate and a beer and just relax for a bit","258":"i stopped in to order take out and get a drink while i waited since it was happy hour i am usually a beer drinker but i decided to step out of my comfort zone and ordered the dragonberry iced tea which was refreshing but not obnoxiously cocktailly very pleasant i had lemongrass chicken and crab rangoon the lemon grass chicken and rice was fantastic i do wish the crab rangoon had a little more filling but the dipping sauce was great ive been here a few times and i have never been disappointed in the food or the service","260":"there never seems to be a crowd at this marsh storegetting in and out is always easy  i agree with the other reviewer on the state of red basketsick  fix please  i like that they opened up aisles so you dont have to walk all the way to one end to go to the next prob happened a long time ago but i just noticed today  and always seems like they are one cashier short here  very good selection of products as always from marsh","262":"i love mr wizards because they offer frozen yogurt which is a  lot healthier than frozen custard i like that they offer some preselect combinations or you can create your own the only part that sucks is that there is only outside seating so if its cold outside plan to eat in your car","267":"delicious crab cocktail and my husband loved his steamers   only down fall is it is really humid in the restaurant itself a fan would be nice","270":"two very good experiences  excellent burger and very good pulled pork  wife loved her egg white and goat cheese omlette  solid beer list and a good spicy bloody mary  also had great service and an ecclectic play list","272":"buddy brew is a very trendy coffee shop based in tampa their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice i really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top the store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in new york   this particular location is in hyde park village the benefit is that parking is free the down side is that seating is limited the store is also extremely cold so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long you may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around hyde park village instead","274":"we were early for church and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat the atmosphere was really inviting and everyone on staff spoke to us at least once   the food was good but not great i had quiche and my guest had a croque madame the crust of the quiche wasnt done and the bread on the croque wasnt that great otherwise these two dishes would have been perfect the fruit was fresh and the coffee was great  i will definitely return","275":"in my book you can never go wrong having a good oldfashioned meal a johnny rockets i had their recent promo which was a barbecued pulled pork burger it was a lot of food and a lot of flavor top that with endless fries and im a happy camper have never had a bad experience at this location they were recently moved from the casino floor level to the shopping level and since they did that they dont do the singing or dancing anymore which is a shame","276":"i still love this place just as much as i ever did and heres why  1 super friendly and knowledgeable staff  2 roomy with lots of outlets and enough space to accommodate midsized groups like the recent yelp office hours 3 delicious tea of course  ive always loved their awake fizz tea but ive also broadened my horizons to include pearl tea aka bubble tea the taro flavor rocked my socks off it did take a little getting used to though as i had a mini anxiety attack every time i took a sip because i got it warm it was in a paper cup and i never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth as a result i spent half my drink wondering is there one in my straw its totally worth the suspense though  the only thing that still troubles me is the music its justnot right in fact sometimes its pretty distracting its easily avoided however just bring headphones and your own musical selection and all is well","280":"i was impressed with this pizza places selection  i stopped in for a quick bite and ordered a roast beef sandwich that was very delicious  the sandwich did take about 15 to 20 minutes to get out of the kitchen  seating is nonexistent in the restaurant but there is a community patio next to castrillos  i am excited to try their pizza  ive only heard good things","307":"i had a mostdelicious bagel sandwich this morning  pork roll egg and cheese on an everything bagel the price was very fair  423  and the bagels are made on site each day they seem understaffed so hopefully they get some more staff to keep up with the crowds","310":"this wasnt my first visit to the italian centre but my last visit was many years ago and all i could remember was the huge selection of charcuterie and cheeses slightly overwhelming to say the least meats and cheeses at the time i had never even heard of with some guidance from the staff i was able to select some delights   fast forward a few years   my most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch so i didnt have time to browse the huge selection of italian delights   i decided to go with the mossimo pizza the toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly the crust was thin and baked to perfection i wasnt expecting such a huge pizza definitely big enough to share and priced at just 14 a steal if you ask me  for pastries we chose the cream horns while they were quite pricy they were certainly delicious likely made that day they were fresh creamy and flakey impossible not to over indulge   while visiting the italian centre i suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry the perfect treat before or after shopping","312":"i was very impressed i had a plain glazed and a glazed with a lemon filling i would go back again if i ever find myself in indy","313":"this are awesome and so good i love the bbq pork one the best the staff is so friendly this is my first dive into vietnamese cuisine and now i def want to try more the bubble tea is so good i am glad there is another place in town to get the bubble tea i never tried it before and i love it they have fresh rolls that taste just as good as sit down thai restaurants i love that they will add extra jalapenos and usually not charge extra they are fresh not pickled and sometimes has seeds which makes it even spicier which is good go now to baguette deli","325":"amazing tacos and tortas quick service dnd authentic mexican fare baked goods as well","328":"i am a huge fan of pf changs so when i found out that they made a fast foodtype restaurant i was excited  the atmosphere isnt like pf changs its loud and it does have a more fast food feel to it i did however love the way it was set up you order your food at the bar sit down and they bring it out to you in 5 minutes if that  the food itself was absolutely fantastic compared to about of time it took to make and the price i was very pleased and surprised with all of the flavors it had i would recommend going there","330":"i had the seafood combocatfish and im talkin like 5 pounds of it red beans and rice and coleslaw  the food was pretty damn good  well the real reason we walked in to this place was due to the big sign out front happy hour monsat 4pm7pm 2 for 1  now that is what im talkin about  i ordered a margaritaand being that im from california i have extremely high standards for margs  wasnt bad but really wasnt great but food made up for it","332":"5 star food  for sure one of if not the best place to get a sandwich on the beach anywhere between st pete beach  clearwater beach all orders cooked to order super size gourmet servings and great very friendly service from the owner artison sandwiches for the price of subway great cook with well seasoned sauces and dips usually i always go for the daily special today was 3 shrimp tacos for 600 the shrimp were cooked perfectly and served on fresh corn tortillas with a kiwi sauce with some fresh peppers just enough spice and fruit with the shrimp delicious i could have had 6 they were so good only drawback is this place is walk up with only bench seating outside not a problem given the food quality for me personally but some may prefer to sit at a table its on the bench or to go a great place if you are staying at one of the local hotel to walk to i hear they will start delivering soon this is a local favorite for me the only reason i did not give 5 stars overall as the seating may be an issue for some","334":"i love it  the reviews were great and i was desperate for good carry out so we decided to try pizzaville is anyone else picturing jt singing  bring it on down to pizzaville  the prices are a bit high but the quality of the food is great  the pizza crust is between a hand tossed and thin crust  perfectly crunchy ends and just chewy enough in the middle  good quality cheese and tangy tomato sauce i ordered it with just mushrooms and they put on a lot   i also asked for heavy sauce  they put extra sauce on the pizza and even gave me an extra container of sauce in case i needed more   i cant decide which was better the pizza or breadsticks  i say breadsticks because they were really more like garlic bread strips  so buttery and garlicy they were great even without sauce  im ashamed to say i ate nearly the entire order myself    the employees are very nice and helpful  the store is clean i need to go back and try their lunch buffet","335":"despite being a spinoff at the burgers from rouge i actually think that the burgers here are dare i say it better then flagship restaurants over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger  ive been here a few times trying the 500 lettuce bacon cheddar special sauce delicious and also making my own combos with their kobe beef burger i think its worth the extra few bucks i like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions the brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special  their fries are also extremely delicious as a huge fan of truffle oil i can never resist getting their truffle oil fries when they come warm out of the fryer coated in truffle oil there is just no better taste known to man  most important of all they are open late on weekends","339":"this was a very busy place was told i had to try this place while i was in st louis  i was not disappointed i got a peach shake that was amazing the rest of my group tried a number of different options that they all enjoyed  the wait was a little long especially on a very hot date the prices were very reasonable  the ordering at the window was confusing multiple windows with not a lot of direction of which line to get in and where to wait for the food its a great place to stop if you are in the area","341":"i visited joes on consecutive nights one with a living social coupon  the beef tacos on the appetizer menu were outstanding and a great price which will ensure i order them every time i come  meatloaf and mashed potatoes were just as i expected thankfully no attempt to fancy them up just tasty comfort food  i asked for french dressing and bleu cheese crumbles on my salad and they were generous with the cheese  the salad was cold and fresh and crisp  the reason i did not give five stars was the service the first night we werent told of specials ugh saw them on the way out and would have ordered them and my friends appetizer order was wrong drinks were not refilled often enough and the waitress seemed uninformed about some of the items  the next night different waitress we were one of only two tables and still waited too long for her to return she was unable to answer a question about a menu item as well  the place is beautiful and the bathroom was clean and bright  the menu offers many thoughtfully composed choices some of your servers are not up to par","343":"i would eat anything they served me i havent even had the pancakes yet and im sold the line out the front door and down the sidewalk should be an indication that this place is awesome i just had basic hashbrowns eggs and bacon but it was so fab and the service was great i will definitely go back and sit down to eat parking is a little difficult around there but thats to be expected","344":"great rich food  but a lil bit pricey  everything tastes wonderful but nothing stays the same the menu is always changing  the most unique donuts you will find","345":"after visiting with friends and indulging in lots of tastes consider this my next order at livery  01 carriage house margarita with its brandy twist 02 all of the empanadas because i have no shame 03 the red drum  its a lovely fish dish and its a way to get a taste of the yuca fries 04 churros take my advice and dont split em with anyone  feel free to copy my order on your visit","357":"most of the time i go through the drive thru here  while sometimes the line is a bit long i have to say these guys move in record time  the line moves fast and my coffee is waiting for me when i get to the window  how much more can you ask for   inside there is a decent amount of seating and there is quite a bit of outdoor seating too  overall this is a great starbucks","358":"great lunch recommended by someone at nashville airport  funky eclectic atmosphere great and healthy food choices sweet potato casserole with coconut and dried cranberry was fantastic","359":"i would give them 5 but i was disappointed by their reuben   for some reason i have to order reuben if it is a new place and the place has a reuben on their menu  but the reubens rye bread was disappointing considering that companion is all about the bread    however my fiancees sandwichforgot the name with chicken bacon avocado on french bread was amazing  had their spice chicken soup with their corn bread  it was great the soup had tons of vegetables and chicken just the right amount of heat and the corn bread is pretty big and delicious    their chi latte was not impressive do not get it lol   little pricey but its a great place to have a wonderful breakfastlunch and the workers are nice and friendly   check this place out let me know what you guys think","370":"very good local ice cream expresso chip moose tracks graham slam are all custom made flavors","385":"love the lamb gyros plate its a distance for me to drive so sometimes i get an extra order to take back home  the tiramisu is very good too the dolmas are good but more vinegary than i prefer  the greek salad that comes with the entree is good also","389":"i have been coming to cd romas for over 10 years i love this place the old locations was a bit more home style feeling and cozy and the new spot has a more modern vibe to it i applaud the change in style with the change in times too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again i am glad to see that the food is still delicious the chicken parm eggplant parm house salad and alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza the alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari i would love to see these replaced with better quality items overall i still love this place and would choose it over olive garden any day i do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but i also miss the good old days when people talked to each other fragglerock ruled and hip hop was wu tang clan oh well","395":"four stars for the beer atmosphere and usually service there is a reason this place is always packed half price beer during a generous happy hour a huge deck that welcomes dogs and delicious key lime pie   sadly said deck allows smoking and there is usually lots of it i wish they at least had a nonsmoking side   if giving a review just based on the food i would give it a two the pretzels are ok but the cheese dip is velveeta nastiest as a native wisconsinite i take offense at plastic cheese then theres the pretzel bun sandwiches ive sampled the chicken brat and italian sausage its pricey considering it comes with potato chips seriously guys get a fryer and just ok the buns were kind of soggy and the overall experience underwhelming especially knowing the epic sandwiches for sale next door i wish the village pub would focus on what its best that serving beer and let us bring mitchells sandwiches over","398":"yumo we spend the day in tarpon springs and headed here around 345 for lunch  dinner we waited for about 10 minutes for our table and were seated   this restaurant has a ton of staff and they are always running around our waiter was nice and quick  we ordred gyro  yum chicken slouvaki  yum spanokopita  yes this is what i ordered good but the top filo dough crust was a bit harder than i like hotdog this is what the 5 year old got  we also got an order of the cheese opa  yes this will be our go to spot when we visit tarpon springs","400":"this restaurant is attached to the drury plaza hotel so it was conveniently located for dinner when youre not really familiar with the area there were 20 in our party each night and the service was pretty good only a few forgotten drinks which was to be expected with such a large group  portions are huge and food was good i had the cuban sandwich one night and it was massive but delicious the shandy is good the margaritas are not and i dont recommend their patron one i forget the name but it wasnt that good their shrimp tacos have a kick but theyre good too","402":"ive been here twice now and sampled a bunch of what they have to offer  i feel like what you order will really dictate how much you like this place  ie they do some things great and other things just soso  the two things i will surely go back for more of is the sausage and pepper pizza capitalized  because i mean business and some sort of puff pastry that has a white cream in the middle  im sure it has a name but it escapes me  the pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausagepeppers had a nice kick to it  im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately fortunately for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator  the cream puff cream was just awesome  couldnt pinpoint the flavor vanilla but i would prefer it to top every dessert i get from this point forward  i also got a bunch of the other sweets salted brownie blondie red velvet crumbcake and a few bagels  all were good but not great  was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels  whole wheat bagels usually suck  what i didnt really like was the pepperoni pizza  it was pretty bland for my liking  in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza  and the pepperoni was pretty sparse i also didnt like being told 25 minutes showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza  the small shop  no chairs  awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour    since its close to me and has so many tasty looking treats yet to try  ill surely be back  hopefully ill get more great than soso","403":"it is an actual speakeasy very cool and chill place the ambience is classy but the vibe of the place is casual highly recommend if you just want to have good cocktailsdrinks with good music  warning they literally serve one dish of appetizer which is not that tasty dont go empty stomach and with expectation of good food or any food as i mentioned it is true to its speakeasy status","408":"bbq chicken sandwich only 575 nice chicken was nicely grilled your choice of topppings  sacues pretty neat   grilled sourdough wheat bun or white bun  quite a few options to choose from at a great price","414":"good food  cashier alessandra very polite and respectful  meal box was reasonable for the price  and it  tasted good as well i will come back if in the area","417":"kudos to this place for providing a much needed late night snack while i was visiting nashville didnt have to wait on delivery because they allowed pickup at 2 am pizza honestly looked like it wasnt going to be all that great but looks were deceiving the pizza was delicious and my only regret was that i didnt order a bigger one","419":"very cute place with a great selection of loose leaf teas and other tea paraphernalia the drinks and sweets are delicious and creative great relaxing ambience as a tea lover i loved reading the books about tea that the owner had the owner is very nice and is very knowledgeable and passionate about tea i would love to come back again","422":"great treat to beat the heat i stopped in during the manayunk arts festival yesterday to get a cold refreshing treat and i was very pleased with the service and the quality of the fresh frozen yogurt and toppings  it is a self service froyo establishment with countless options of flavors and toppings i enjoyed the toasted coconut yogurt and topped it with rainbow sprinkles fresh strawberries blueberries and raspberries the fruit was very refreshing but it was hard to select what to put on it because everything looked so yummy if you are a chocolate lover there are plenty of candy toppings to add to your froyo too   if you are not sure what flavor you will enjoy best you can sample them with small paper cups that so you dont have to find out if you like the flavor or not after you already purchase   another plus is that the establishment is kept very clean and it still looks as new as it did when it first opening on main street just a couple of years ago","424":"we had a groupon and so we went  great lobsters although they were out of a few sizes this evening but they were delicious and our waitress jessica was very attending and nice  made some good suggestions  not fancy but good lobster","427":"ambience ok too bad stuck in a mall in new hope  they were very understaffed which thankfully they kept apologizing for so there service was definitely slow however very very pleasant  we definitely felt it was worth the wait  vegetable samosas were delicious chicken were slightly dry  i ordered chicken tikka masala which was so flavorful and rich and my husband had the chicken tagineamazing  has the feeling of a place where you get what you get and you dont get upset but when you get it it is really out of this world  loved the mix of cuisines just enough choices on the menu  restaurant is byob so we were unprepared but we will be back","428":"this is the cutest mompop local highquality ice cream joint in all of tucson delicious but definitely a bit pricey 450 for a regular single scoop hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5","431":"came late friday night for a bite to eat much of the soup hot takeaway were cleaned up settled for an individual pizza to share crust was too thick but we could debate pies until the cows come home wandered the store while it was baking and found scharffenberger chocolate pie may not be up to our standard but the chocolate hit the spot at 8pm at night the staff was exhausted","432":"i normally wouldnt think greek food for brunch or lunch im way more of a traditional americanstyle brunch kind of guy  but when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend i trusted their better judgement  in the end im glad i did  this cozy center city spot not only serves an amazing and dare i say a contender for the best brunch in philly the staff really make you feel at home  they really know how to wow their patrons fresh food delightful presentation and so many delicious sounding choices its hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains  their specialty and theyre not shy to tell you is the cyprus breakfast  its a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs meat and starch  the plate comes out with two sunnyside up eggs fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely  its served alongside a grilled slice of lounza greek ham two pieces of salty crisp fried halloumi warm bread and tomato cucumber and onion salad  the menu also features a spread of other traditional greek mediterranean and middle eastern specialities avgolemono moussaka pastitsio shaksouka and malohwa to name a few  they even serve greek coffee and frappes  the service may be a little overattentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome but its much appreciated especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food  one other tip reservations are highly recommended if not required  because of kanellas small space getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if youre not on the list  but if you can score seats here for brunch then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning or recover from last nights activities  cant wait to come back and try out the dinner menu","434":"on the run is a convenience store chain and bp gas station it is in a very convenient location for those who are returning rental cars at lambertst louis international airport how many times have you been on the way back into an airport and not found a gas station nearby happens to me to any times  often you have to go out of your way to find one not so here  paid at the pump  i note that the pump had a hand scrawled note taped to the pumps  requesting you press the appropriate button credit or debit before swiping your credit card never seen this before  this is the exact opposite procedure of other gas station pumps when using a credit card  refueled and was on my way to hertz","436":"i heard this ice cream parlour opened last summer so upon my first trip home sometime during the fall i hustled over to try it since friendlys closed a few years ago warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place dq was our last one standing for quite some time   much to my dismay the big scoop had already closed for the season i marked it in my calendar go return in march when it reopened upon my next trip home in the spring i was disappointed to see that i was just a few days early for their reopening and would have to wait until my return in april  after much anticipation i made it to big scoop last weekend with my sister who has been before i was shocked to see what a range of products they serve  hot dogs funnel cake onion rings pizza you name it i was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream but i wasnt that hungry so i settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream the generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough i also tasted the birthday cake which i enjoyed very much   the service was quick and the shop crowded quickly the interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly the man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work   especially given the lack of competition around here the big scoop gets an easy four stars","440":"i was greated by a nice friendly staff there wasnt a long wait for my food i ordered a chicken bacon croissant with chipolte sauce they cut it in half as requested and was served in maybe only 20 seconds after the time it took to cook food taste great","442":"city

that is quick and affordable the fountain has you covered the menu isnt extensive but its got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches salads and soups    their cuban sandwich 10 w side was pretty excellent  the bread wasnt the traditional paninistyle but a french baguetteit was still great and had a little crispness to it  all the main ingredients meat mustard pickles cheese were in good balance  as a florida boy who loves his cuban sandwiches i would definitely recommend this  i also tried a bit of their royal grille a grilledchese sandwich with several cheeses as well as apple slices on whole grain wheat bread 850 w side extra to add hamturkey  it was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right  a side salad was also done well  for my side i chose their spicy carrots which sounded unique  it consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper served in a cup the carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic  the spice was just enough to be pleasant  i would definitely get these again  our food came out super quick and our service was great  im looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars","454":"awesome place great beer selection music and friendly service check it out","456":"great brewery friendly staff nice area outside to sit my favorite ipa around priced the same as other breweries in the area 67 for pint","461":"i absolutely love this market i live in southwest philly and i do not mind traveling to get what i love from this market the ground beef and babyback ribs are the freshest ever yes it maybe a little pricy but its worth it if i lived in center city i would shop there everyday literally i highly recommend this for your grocery shopping","470":"this is my local convenience store  the place is open 247 the atms are no surcharge yes they place really really cool music  ok so i just glanced over at simon es review of this same wawa and he says the vibe is upbeat and that is def true  friendly staff who seem happy to work there  and getting a wave in the always packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence  gripes  parking  i never even try to park in the front lot anymore  i either walk to wawa or if i am driving i park in the back lot  yes wawa has a second lot behind the store  almost always an open spot  often times there is 510 open spots back there    gripes continued  often there are panhandlers  not really wawas fault i mean we are talking germantown ave in philadelphia proper it is a reality  there have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014 so this is not a concern really any longer  major points for   seasonal specialties  i look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips  i also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts   prices  everything is reasonable  some stuff is cheap selection  good choice for candy chips snacks healthy snacksprotein bars drinks etc for the massive volume that the store does the lines usually move very fast and efficiently and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed the store is clean from my point of view  it is a busy busy store but i never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station  i do not eat any of the hot food  low quality i steer clear     for a convenience store that is open 24 hours wawa is awesome    does this one have a bathroom  i never used it i never checkedbut maybe there is no bathroom for customers there  maybe it is around back  hmmm  i would avoid using it anyway   also this wawa could never have gas pumps traffic is already congested between allens lane and mt airy avenue along germantown ave  between wawa and the bank of america on the corner overall  this place is awesome based on the music selection and friendly staff working 247  this store does a lot right","473":"sweet potato pancakes are a must very fluffy and delicious syrup staff was quick and friendly","478":"we ate here several times mainly because of the excellent shrimp juju appetizer  in fact our second night we had 2 orders of the shrimp  we are grateful to our server colin for recommending them our first night   as im writing this review i can still picture the shrimp and even better i can still taste it    there are a few dishes i dream about and this is one of them      we also tried the fried calamari it was good    im from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari   in the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which im still getting used to    our entrees were very good poboy and fish of the day     its a nice place ambiance wise in a very good location      i will give a shoutout to colin for recommending the shrimp juju","480":"great service  food was delish fried avocado  tres leches cake was yum  cuban sandwich was simple and tasty","483":"mexican comfort foodlove from a truck","488":"our first time trying on this rainy sunday we ordered a whole order of the house special fried rice w beef added a order of chicken wings a egg roll  a spring roll the rice was delish the only thing was the egg roll was not what i prefer the spring roll was the best out of the two definitely going back soon","494":"this is a quiet quaint place hidden from the traffic madre is a clean modern looking restaurant tacos are the main food sandwichs guaq and chips beer and other drinks are available also my wife had the ensinada fish taco  baja style grilled i had the idaho potato and chorizo and mushroom tacos  all were superb and unique with sauces and ingredients i will gladly go there again and enjoy the quiet atmosphere and great food service was fantastic also","497":"a friend suggested this cafe for a lunch date a while back and i cannot stay away my husband is obsessed with their peanut butter deluxe smoothie and while its an obsession i cannot afford to indulge  their bread is what dreams are made of i love to get their soup due jour over brown rice yum whether its breakfast or lunch  you cant go wrong at cafe deluxe","499":"first off i love a good traditional cuban sandwich and taste of havana delivers  strong cuban if maybe a wee bit dry  it might be just a bit too big  youll be satisfied with the mini and a bag of plantain chips  next time im going to try the chorizo  spanish chorizo is terrific and the extra fat in the meat may help with the moist quotient  still great shop very cool owners and well worth the trip to broad ripple","500":"im not a praline expert but these were solid  very friendly staff that will give you nice sized samples  tried the chocolate caramel tortue which was one of the best turtles that ive had    very fresh chewy and chocolatey","507":"quiet good service good fish standard boring and tasteless app and salad nice decor good menu would go back would avoid the salad happy hour mth 57 drinks and appetizers","509":"thankfully i had a much different and better experience than most other yelpers  while i agree that the prices are steep quality seafood isnt cheap so i dont feel that it was out of line  since i dont like working for my food i skipped the crabs and went for the scallops for 24 i got 7 nice sized scallops saut\u00e9ed in lemon butter and a side of pasta  the scallops were some of the best ive ever tasted i am of the opinion that 24 was a steal for the quality i received here  in addition to excellent food my martini was well executed and deliciously potent the service was exceedingly helpful and friendly id definitely recommend a stop in for all those that have passed by before and for those who may have been less impressed in the past","516":"salads are delish although a bit pricey at 775 a pop i felt the healthful salad eating justified a cookie though and damn was that money well spent they do baked goods and coffeehouse drinks as well as bready and salady treats very well  great lunch spot eat outside on a sunny day","518":"theres lots of contention about the eurosnooty attitude of la colombes baristas  they may have a point  however since i lived in philly and now in dc la colombes niza roast has been about the only roast that takes me back to my childhood  whenever i come back to philly to visit my bf which is quite often i end up buying a 5lb bag of niza roast in beans to use with my trusty gaggia i do my own grinding and the coffee is absolutely delicious  having said that the baristas should attend the dale carnegies how to win friends and influence people as well as read the old im ok youre ok trusty book  their attitude does need improvement fersure","519":"born and raised in south jersey i consider myself both a diner connoisseur and diner snob this one is great  a lot of locals eat here and the waitresses have worked here for quite some time  breakfast and lunch are really yummy  food comes out quickly and service is prompt  really good quality food for just a diner and they recently expanded for more space hooray  great value plan to spend about 1014 for a good size meal","534":"food is quite tasty i was skeptical because its a chaotic mess in there with some sort of assembly line to get your food however much of it gets pieced together at the register","536":"i have been wanting to go to a sushi conveyor belt place for the longest time so when i finally got the chance to go to yo sushi i was so excited its located at intl mall on the ground floor in the middle of the mall by the escalators and godiva   i went during lunch time with 3 people on a tuesday around 1 pm and was promptly seated  i ordered about 6 plates 4 from the conveyor and 2 from my waiter  the sushi was pretty good portions are small for the price but still okay  i got this eggplant dish from the belt and it was so good i love eggplant   the prices are determined by the color of the plates the price came out to about 25 for everything which wasnt bad considering getting 6 plates the salmon sushi plates were my favorite and the popcorn shrimp was so good   only problem we had was one of the dishes my friend ordered tuna tataki took like 30 minutes to get to us i dont know if they put it on the belt accidentally or what but our waiter didnt seem too concerned about my friend waiting so long for what he ordered   hopefully service is a bit better next time i go","537":"the food took forever servers were really friendly but they looked very unorganized example after breakfast we asked for a heated cinnamon roll and it sat so long it got cold again lol it was amazing though once we finally got it the pork belly was great eggs way undercooked overall we might go back for a cinnamon roll to go but not to eat just not worth the waiting","540":"this place was recommended to me by one of the hotel staff what he described the place to be was spot on  it is very eclectic with random decor and music  the bartender was on point and the rest of the staff seemed friendly enough  i ordered the big jerk sandwich and the caprese but asked to have that as a salad instead of a sandwich which they had no problem doing both were good with the caprese stealing the show  the food the big jerk was flavorful and the meat was very tender pork it was a little on the dry side even tho it came with a dipping sauce the caramelized onions were a little on the sweet side the pickle spear that came with it was not your standard dill spear it is homemade and very fresh just lacking a little zest but still good the caprese rocked the balsamic reduction cubes of moz diced tomatoes and sunflower seeds was a winning combination i will definitely get that again but next time i will ask them to scale back on the size way more than i needed  now for the good stuff the house beer phat beer im not big on ipas or local brews but this one has won my heart somewhere twixt a bud and bud light but with a lot more flavor and a little pinch on your tongue  the only reason phats didnt get five stars was because of the big jerk they need to freshen that up a little  footnote phats needs to upgradeseparate the restrooms the women should not have to deal with what the men leave behind they also need to upkeep it on a more regular basis they also definitely need to get an exhaust hood over the griddle","542":"i had a cup of roasted black coffee and one croissant they were nice i felt foods offered were a little bit expensive but drink was not so there was a nice environment to study so i could concentrate on my work not loud good location to access and friendly staffs it was pity i couldnt use rest room though","545":"long wait if you go on a weekend but worth the wait the potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes ive ever had bacon was delicious as well both the smores and classic french toast were very good pricey but worth it for special occasions","551":"yes i feel guilty after i finished eating but that is just for like 5 mins then i just remember how tasty and awesome the burger was if you are into burgers with a twist i would recommend visiting this place if you are going during lunch break make sure you pop by early the place is small and fills up quickly","556":"they lose a star for having two stores on essentially the same roadone on the far northeast side and one on the far northwest side really trader joe your stores are all over the place in other cities like chicago dc san franciscobut southside indy gets zerodowntown indy none thats not cool joe not cool at all   however the employees are pretty useful and cool and sometimes even funny the food is affordable i like that it doesnt take me 15 minutes to get through the store because its petite love the products once i got a spoiled piece of salmon and they cheerfully refunded me and i didnt have to bring back the gross fish i like the free samples last night i had a bite of pumpkin pie love that i can have a cheese party without going broke their lowbudget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends arent super snobby about booze   kefir nondairy milks organic products cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores their frozen foods are very good and the morningstar farms sausage links everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores   i am particularly fond of the somewhatstrange party snacks although they are much pricier than at saraga   trader joes is a great place to find food to cheat with if youre not much of a cook or are pressed for time for example you can buy an alreadyseasoned tritip to use for your steak fajitas you can find premarinated chicken to put on the grill they also sell many precooked foods that you just have to microwaveif you cant cook at all   in conclusion start writing letters people we need a downtown trader joes it isnt fair that so many of us including students who want nothing more than to eat healthy have to drive 30 minutes each way to get groceries","557":"good food great service hailey was the shit dont worry when we make this mac and cheese business pop off well give u the word","566":"i was walking on delaware ave looking for an atm and a cup of coffee and wandered into the ing cafe after tapping my account i walked around a curving wall and stepped into a very open lively and orange public space i had an excellent cup of peets free wifi but honestly the people watching was so good i got very little real work done great spot to crash and get a cup excellent vibe so nice you will wonder if you are really allowed to just walkin like that","569":"ive eaten here and gotten food via the drivethru many times and the food has always been fine its standard mcdonalds food so i wont other with a description i happen to love their fries and like their cheeseburgers and a couple of the breakfast sandwiches   service has varied from soso to goodbut usually toward the good end of the scaleand the speed has been from slow to superfast my one problem with this mcdonalds location is not getting straws or not getting napkins when the drivethru is busy and the workers are rushing so do check your bags after you leave the window i actually preemptively carry a spare straw in my glove compartment because of how many times this has happened  they have free wifi if thats useful to know","571":"amazing pizza also love ceci bean dip great outdoor patio  recommend going on tuesdays for half off select pizzas","572":"a lovely spot for a nice dinner we had delicious pacific northwest oysters that made me smile and the risotto was rich without being overly decadent the service was very friendly and sweet my only wish is for a more varied wine list","573":"i took my son here as a surprise yesterday because he is a big fan of lobster rolls i had a groupon coupon and it was well worth the money the lobster roll dint disappoint though id like to try other menu items as well my son thoroughly enjoyed his lobster roll too so again it was money well spent to see him pleased the restaurant itself is a little short on space and ambiance when we were there they were slammed all at once but the owner stepped in apologized got us seated and took our order he was humorous and kind which took the edge off i will visit again and this time ill try the steamed shrimp or crab legs give it a try itz worth it","576":"i must admit when we saw the place totally empty on sun at 6pm i was concerned we ordered the combos to get a taste of various items food was plated quickly and served with a complimentary beer i have to say that for the most part each item was really excellent i will elaborate  brisket was absolutely perfect tons of flavor super tender some fat but that is not only expected it is desired the best  ribs were also super moist and very flavorful i read that some reviewers had dry ribs these were seriously excellent there were so many bbq sauces to try too i have to say that there was little need to put sauce on it yes that good  pulled pork was great a tad too salty but by no means unpleasant like another reviewer stated very moist great flavor  the chicken was a pulled chicken i guess i should have been clearer and asked for bbq chicken the pulled chicken was good but also a little over salted it seemed to be white meat that was shredded  they do have collards not on menu and they were very good  the spinach was a bit better in my opinion as they had a generous amount of garlic and olive oil very italian   garlic mashed were very good cole slaw was also very good  now that we tasted most of the menu the standouts for me were the brisket ribs and spinach  another reviewer was disturbed by the italian language tv channel seriously  get over it the ownerchef is italian and speaks the language this also explains why they also have pizza i cant wait to try the pizza next time  we both loved this place and cant wait to return however weight is an issue so wait we will","577":"the food was good price was ok we were instructed to sit on a table next to the window which i really liked the waitress was not very smiley and kind but she managed well enough  overall its recommend for a good coffee and brunch ","582":"this is a great breakfast sandwich spot affordable prices and tasty bagels my favorite is garlic i wasnt blown away with the lunch options but i would recommend this place for breakfast to my friends and family their quality is way better than dunkin donuts sandwiches however the man and woman behind the counter are very rude and its a shame becuase the owner seems like such a nice man they have ignored customers standing in a long line to hold conversations and move extremely slow as if no one has anywhere to go dont bother calling an order ahead becuase chances are they wont answer the phone during breakfast hours","583":"great spot to get caffeinated minimalist interior and a paired down menu lets you know the focus here is on the coffee helpful staff and a great product makes this a great stop for a drink in st pete","586":"im in town for an obgyn conference and really wanted to explore the local gems  oh yelp you make travel so much better  i was on my way to grab lunch and passed by a cute window display and decided i would come their for dessert and coffee    im a coffee snob  peets in the bay area intelligencia in chicago dunn bros etc and the coffee here was pretty good  just a shade lighter roast than peets    i also picked up some amaretti cookies to share but once i tried them decided to keep them   light airy buttery almond flavored little circles of joy    i plan to go back before i leave and get some delicious treats to take home","589":"formally lexis now under new ownership sienna casino  beautiful river view restaurant  we arrived for a semi late sunday dinner after some gambling at the casino very dead only one other group there they left about 10 min later after we arrived so we had the entire restaurant to ourselves    we both ordered from the price fix menu ribeye steak 11oz with salad  dessert  accompanied by a bottle of markham merlot  service was perfect along with the food  well be back","590":"some of the best chocolate ice cream ive had fun atmosphere and impressive menu will definitely be back","595":"absolutely amazing food everything is extremely fresh homemade and majestic in the mouth its a bit pricey considering the portions and ambiance but other than that amazing","603":" i noticed that this location is often reviewed as serving the best gyros in town could be i cant say as its the only place in town where ive purchased a gyro  i have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together every time i had it as a young man it tasted gamey smelled somewhat like moist dog food  its been years of avoiding gyros until tonight i had some time to wait here in this area so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what theyre doing  yeah this sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat i was eating it didnt taste bad at all i dont think its something i will make a regular meal as i am sensitive to dairycheese","607":"yummy i had the lemon ginger donut as dessert and had two sliders for my meal i will say at lunch time on a monday getting those two sliders took over a half hour  only downside is these guys are waaaaay too busy","608":"cute little shop with fun decor but dont miss the great cupcakes had good and very friendly service and will be back though no often due to being a little pricy","611":"this quiznos always gets it done for me i come here often on my lunch break and i usually have a pleasant experience the line moves fast and the food is typically good   bottom line if youre craving a sub but not subway come to quiznos this location as good as any","613":"ive only visited the breadland organic whole grain bakery breathes to buy glutenfree bread i was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best glutenfree bread and buns she has ever tasted she said they were so good that she ate six buns in a row i was excited when i heard this because kinnikinnicks bread is not very good its like eating bricks and it took me years to get used to it not to mention it only really tastes good when its toasted   ive tried breadlands arrowroot glutenfree buns these are indeed very good they are very soft and the outside is chewy and they taste great with just about anything butter hummus melted cheese or peanut butter  jam the only problem is that i cant eat them because they give me really bad eczema on my face i suspect its all the yeast they put in it the focaccia glutenfree bread they sell is also really good this is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and i think some garlic too its so good and although it contains yeast i dont get eczema so it must not be that much   these breads are very expensive though so i only get them as a treat","620":"delicious i had the famous cream cheese ice cream topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream definitely worth a visit","622":"have gone to this location several times and am always impressed the staff is always super polite and welcoming even when it is a busy weekday lunch hour they even offer samples if youre having trouble deciding the bakery area is always well stocked some favorites of panera in general include black bean soup vegetable soup with pesto asian chicken salad thai chicken salad tuna salad sandwich cuban panini napa almond chicken salad sandwich i recently tried a soba noodle bowl with chicken and it was yummy perfect size with a side of baguette and i absolutely love the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad wish it was around all year losing one star because it is always freezing in here despite the time of year not a comfortable eating atmosphere","623":"service was good and fast they were short handed and the hostess made me aware of this fact when i sat down good was served quickly and hot tasty as always at cb","624":"great spot also has breakfast until 3 vs many places which end at 11 the eggs benedict and eggs florentine were delicious strawberry mimosa was a bit sweet but good bloody mary is bomb server was very nice","625":"this tim hortons location youre gonna love entering into very modern and cafe shiek combined to the fact theres a lot of open space so you wont feel cramped and the open ceiling ive noticed minimizes crowd sounds so youll be able to have amazing conversations with your friends","637":"very cool nostalgictype bakery you must try the pepperoni stromboli now","641":"i was hoteling nearby and was hankerin for sum friiiiied chicken   did the drive thru 050616 and found no reason to fault them for food or service  ordered the 10 box meal  add a breast  comes w drink  the visit hit the spot and was very typical of the experience ive had at several other kfcs  my service was fast  friendly  employees on point  ringin the bell as i leave like at long john silvers  good job crew","649":"best donair really does have good donairs  i wouldnt day best but pretty darn good  the first time i ate here the man behind the counter talked on his cell phone the entire i was in there  even while he made my food  despite this annoyance i returned to best donair because the donair i had was delicious  my second experience was much better  no cell phone  and both times i ate there the amount of meat in my donair was monumental  i have to admit as an avid donair eater i was completely shocked at the amount of meat they gave me but perhaps that is where the name best donair derives from  they also have ice cream for a sweet treat after your meal  if theres room","653":"cant believe i havent tried chipotle until today  me and my girlfriend decided to go for dinner this evening and from what she told me i was pretty excited  as you walk in and approach the counter you can see the different protein choices salsas rice etc  i decided to go with a burrito with white limecilantro rice black beans steak pico de gallo and cheese  the burrito was massive and was less than 7 dollars  ingredients all tasted fresh very refreshing  i honestly cant wait to go again  my only complaint is that the chips we shared were stale and horribly over salted  4 stars","655":"the food is great a true taco truck  i only wish they would set up recycling for the cans and bottles  otherwise a tucson classic almost better than guero canelo","656":"spot has been on my burger list to try for sometime spot burger consistently shows up on numerous best of philly burger lists when they opened up shop in brewery town i quickly bookmarked spot and waited for a burger craving to hit me to give it a try  spot is on west girard ave and i was able to find parking easily and close by on a sunday night the space is clean and bright with tables in the front and back there is also counter seating there was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave spot a cool urban vibe design  the people that work at spot were very friendly and helpful they explained the specials and helped us with suggestions i was surprised that spot has other items such as fish  chips and muscles in addition to burgers sloppy joes pulled pork and cheese steaks mental notes for my next visit  i went with the spot burger which had hickory smoked bacon cheddar pickles coleslaw and spot sauce this was a great burger the bun was excellent fresh and toasted just right  the burger was moist and juicy the bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger my daughter had the santa fe with avocado pepper jack cheese jalape\u00f1o red onion sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce this was also a really good tasting burger spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces   we ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy they were very good fries but sketch still has my favorite fries we had a couple of fanta sodas too which was pretty cool all of our food came out surprisingly fast  spot is very high up on my burger list and very close to sketch spot lived up to the hype and is really cool little place in an up and coming section of the city i will be back and probably soon 4 plus yelps","663":"great cozy cafe for studying or meeting up with friends super well decorated and clean friendly staff  the food and drinks are really yummy but i find it is overpriced for what you get","666":"yes it a great place and great coffee but none of these coffee places know how to serve a decent cup of black tea i should say start with the tea leaves but ill leave that alone 1 the cup of tea is scalding hot 2 the tea has a burnt taste  so you need to lower the temperature  then get to back to other things like tea leaves","672":"i do like this place the employees are relaxed and friendly the pizza and salads are good and the price is fair  also good location for me","677":"all those cereal commercials are lying to you a balanced breakfast doesnt consist of milk oj cereal and a banana if you want a balanced breakfast you should hop in line for fried chicken a glazed donut and coffee from fednuts    im not much of a sweet breakfast person but the donuts are great here the chicken is wonderful no matter how you have it dressed  wet or dry theyre all good and when youre eating chicken and donuts for breakfast youre probably going to need something to get you moving afterwards the coffee  oh and dont try to convince someone to come with you that needs an explanation on why those two foods are served together those people dont deserve it","681":"i love getting delivery from here i agree with the other posts that if you dine inside the service is hit ir miss but theyre pizza is great and delivery has always been punctual","683":"they have pretty decent hours particularly on sunday  there beer isnt overpriced but their craft beer options are good but not great in my opinion  they have been having a lot of sales reps coming into the store for samplings at least lately so its a nice opportunity to try something new if you happen to be lucky enough to be there on one of those days","691":"quiet plenty of comfy seating solid tea selection chill music  perfect place for working on the laptop  not the cheapest place in the world to get a cup of tea but the incredibly calm vibe is worth every penny","693":"mmmmmm scotch eggs and a super hopped ipa or a dark toasty porter  this is a must stop kind of place if you like good beer  if youre looking for 2 domestic bottles go somewhere else  they have the typical brewpub grub and outside seating  i dont go as often as id like but always look forward to it  they usually have a couple of seasonals on tap that always seem to be good  ive never had a bad beer here","696":"great place very modern i like the choices of food items and beverages it was well thought great sitting spaces the concept is absolutely fantastic with the clients in mind you can pick from a very intimate romantic corner to a more casual stool sitting by the bar area not sure about the charm of their live singers they can be truly annoying if they are singing for a long time which is usually the case heavy metal by the end of the day that is a nono please other than that this is quite an interesting place to meet and relax","700":"i havent had too much greek food in my life other than your typical gyros i have been to athens thoughand had pretty good food there really good lambs streetgyros and a lot of mythos beer  eating at this restaurant on a hot humid summer day brought me back to my trip to athens except that i didnt have the view of greek ruins lit up at night those narrow winding streets or bottles of mythos on my table its a byob  but the food did bring me back to my memories in greece we had the dips moussaka rabbit and lamb i cant say anything bad about them however the meal wasnt spectacularit just didnt have that extra flare for me to give that last star then again im a big food snob i would recommend the place to anyone looking for greek cuisine and i would definitely recommend coming here during summer and getting a seat outdoor","715":"this place has awesome salsa  too bad it is such a small cup for four diners  they serve the same size to a party of one or two  there are no free refillshmmm the huevos rancheros was delicious  the egg was cooked to perfection and the veggies rice and guac were excellent  the sante fe burrito is truly huge  also delicious great salsa verde  the grilled skirt steak was tender and properly marinated check out the enchilada oaxaca it was a real winner when visiting family in this area again we will return","717":"i am a huge seafood fan my husband not so much but he loves me so he knew i had to get in one seafood fix while we were in sb i found this place on yelp and it got the highest rating on the pier i ordered the local rock crab special and it was great good soup excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge plenty of crab for one person they had great service beautiful location it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating the only reason i give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood my poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food i guess thats what he gets for being picky","721":"the lucky perk is a pretty cool place to meet with friends or clients ive been here a few times and always get good coffee and an inviting atmosphere the only thing i didnt care for was the sausage burrito it was hot but 99 potatoes and a 1 sausage not worth the money other than that its a cool place and ill go back","723":"great breakfast for a great price what more can you ask for  just came for a quick dinein before shopping and must say their 5th st benedict was amazingly satisfying it was the chorizo that was mixed in their gravy which made the perfect combination oh and when you order a cup of coffee its really a cup of coffee lol place is small and didnt really have many pastries made the morning i was there must be an afternoon thing  ill be headed back for more of their menu asap whenever i fly out there again ","725":"good donuts there was a small selection but it was late afternoon when i came so i dont blame them extremely nice staff","728":"great prices  selection but what a zoo lots of rude customers can make a bad shopping experience customer service is almost always top notch","731":"tried vanilla vanilla chocolate chocolate and strawberry shortcake today the chocolate and vanilla frosting are really good strawberry shortcake is too sweet for me as for the cake part vanilla is excellent loved it but i could taste baking powdersoda in the chocolate cake the last one was soaked in strawberry jamsauce and the cake became sticky but the cakes are not dry as in others review i think they have improved the recipes vanilla vanilla is the best i got today will try other flavors next time","744":"whats not to like about mr wizards  its definitely a different feel than the other ice cream places around the crowds a little more bizarre and the location dogtownish is significantly more convenient for me and my friends  i came here for the first time the other night and definitely expected not to be wowed but dammit if it wasnt good  i ordered a specialty flavor the wizard which was chock full of brownies nuts i think and strawberries  the medium size was bigger than i expected and it ran me about 500 so next time ill go for a smaller size  i like mr wizards and ill definitely be back  i like the casual neighborhood feel the thicker different taste of the custard and the fact that the location is right  just one question who is mr wizard","748":"ive been wanting to try this place for some time but can never seem to get far enough south to swing by my manfriend and i made the trek this past saturday to get some of their recent release  17  the atmosphere is minimal and inviting the bar is covered with a nice copper coating and has ample room for seating the space itself is very open and offers plenty of sitting for more high volume times the tap room features board games and darts  not a typical sight at a brewery the bartenders were friendly and efficient   i had the baileys chocolate oatmeal stout  delicious has a great subtle bitterness which i assume comes from the chocolate the oatmeal rounds out the mouthfeel of this beer making it super palatable  my manfriend had the 17  an imperial stout with chocolate  mint this beer is a home run i rated it a 5 on untappd job well done cant wait to cellar one of the 750 ml we took home for a bit and explore this brew again  ill definitely be back the food looked great and hoping to come sample some of their fare next time i visit","751":"finally   a chipotle that i love  you have restored my faith in you  the meat is cooked they give you enough of a serving and the staff is friendly  i sat outside and ate and people watched","754":"i saw that this place when i was meeting for one of my girlfriends for lunch at michaels deli she was running late so i decided that i would get her a treat batch had an interesting selection of cupcakes available i bought 5 cupcakes 1 which was regular vanilla and the other just regular chocolate they werent anything to rave about the other 3 cupcakes i gave to my friend but they weremaple red velvet and oreo i didnt get a chance to taste these specialty ones but my friend said she enjoyed them although the vanilla and chocolate were quite plain i think ill go back to try the other cupcakes i will say that the cupcakes were moist inside which was really nice","756":"great food but it is a little touristy i am spoiled because i am a local and go to the spongedocks a lot if this is your first time in the area hellas is a must even if only for their bakery if i could write a separate review for bakery it would be 5 star","758":"i tried their decaf latte which was tasty foamy so good and light that i didnt need to add sugar the store is cute and the baristas very friendly it has a private parking lot but its always packed i definitely come back on my next visit to santa barbara","759":"gorgeous old building that used to be an 1800s commodities exchange but is repurposed to house souvenir shops and some food court type eateries  although the stores are cheesy it can be a great rest stop and the inside is still stunning","762":"yum  literally thats all i can say about this place i went twice in one weekend im literally obsessed so where do i begin  the doughssants or cronuts as some people prefer how yummy i had the cranberry and coconut one theyre very dense so get one before your meal bc i could only take one bite out of mine after i finished my grilled cheese oh man that grilled cheese they have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto now i am not a pesto fan i know very strange but it works great here but the selling point is the tomato basil soup literally the best i have ever had and this is my favorite soup so i have tried it everywhere the second time i tried the classic breakfast 2 eggs any style i opted for scrambled country hash delicious and toast this time i had my doughssant beforehand smores flavored  amazeballs   the space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated the staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making lighthearted and sincere conversation   there is a wait to be seated but you just have to stick it out because you dont want to miss out on this new restaurant   ill be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so i can sip on a mimosa while i enjoy my grilled cheese","763":"girlfriend cpa got their cpa and liked it me bring a huge got fan got the white walker both were good as were the pizzas","764":"this place has a great selection of anything you need its also very spacious the staff is kind and quick and i like that they are a bit on the pricey side if you are purchasing hard liquor which is why i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 if you are buying beer or hard soda the price is normal","768":"great rock crab loved the clam chowder excellent service and who can say no to onion rings  didnt really like the fried seafood  batter didnt stay crisp very long nothing was over cooked just didnt like the batter","773":"great for lunch our meals were hearty tasty and affordable most entrees priced around 10  i had the hummus plate which came with 4 falafels pita bread and greek salad but the real star was the greek chicken soup that my husband ordered the broth reminded me of a creamy thai soup because its infused with lemon flavor half the customers in the restaurant ordered this and i would definitely go back for seconds  cant wait to try dinner at kanella especially since kelly w says the fish is out of this world","778":"nice coffee and a pleasant escape if you have had enough of renos rundown casino charm","785":"this is a lovely place for some amazing chinese food the restaurant is so clean and updated the staff is very polite and friendly the menu has a wide selection of items even kids menu is pretty large i personally cant get enough to do the orange chicken its amazing a must try","787":"excellent boba happyfriendlyhelpful service spacious dining area  ive had the mango snow smoothie with boba and matcha milk tea with half boba and half pudding at half sweetness the matcha milk tea was perfect strong matcha flavor just the right level of sweetness perfectly cooked boba and good pudding i was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because i didnt realize they allowed customization  the mango i will probs not get again was syrupy and overly sweet before i knew to ask for reduction in sweetness and tasted a bit too artificial for me i will have to  stick to the milk teas also wish they added a few more bubbles  the baristas are exceptionally friendly and always patient with my indecisiveness service is quick and drinks are always served with a smile a smile and good milk tea definitely make my day","796":"a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl is big topped with fruit and granola  i bought several ginger shots which were in the cutest bottles perfect for the beach  i will definitely return to this location when im in the area again","799":"had a great stay at this hotel right in the french quarter convenient walking to everything on bourbon street and beyond their continental breakfast had a large variety of items and was free per your stay great comfy beds a huge plus was the nonsmoking hotel that doesnt allow smoking throughout attentive service and wonderful experience great ambiance and decor as i loved the courtyard fountain area at night to just relax after a day in nola bathrooms were a bit small and the shower could of used a door as water splashed out to the main area but overall it was a comfy room free wifi and the staff service was impeccable we had a fuse blown and the repair was done in 15 min after we called it in another plus is the free bottled water everyday as they gave us 2 bottles on the dresser along with 2 in the fridge highly recommended for a stay in the french quarter","812":"i lived in mexico for 8 years and so far this restaurant is the most authentic i have been to in florida  or many other states i had the mole and it was excellent just the right amount of spice and the mole was not over powering as it can be when not prepared correctly this was only their second day of being unofficially open i was told the grand opening will be in a couple of weeks and there were lots of people offering help and assistance things will calm down a bit later and i would rather have lots of people asking me if i need anything than people ignoring me the inside is like entering a art gallery of latin art and even the exterior is a work of art best d\u00e9cor i have ever seen outside of mexico and rivals the top there too it is a wonderful addition to the downtown st pete neighborhood and i am thrilled to see it is moving cool st pete further south  i cant wait to try other items on the menu 5 stars from me","820":"i thought this place was really good i love thai food and ive tried a good amount of places this is definitely one of the fresher and better tasting ones ive had the service is excellent and the food is good too","823":"ive always enjoyed this spot as a bar but havent had many meals here  i took a client to lunch there yesterday we arrived at peak lunch time 1230 and the restaurant was pretty slow this worked fine for us we were seated right away and had a perfectly attentive waitress service was awesome for a working lunch we never went without but there werent a ton of interruptions  i got one of their specials the bacon turkey burger and fries the burger was good sized for a lunch portion after eating it i was full but not stuffed the burger itself was well seasoned the turkey was light but hearty enough the bacon was mostly good but part of it was not as crispy as i like it it comes with all the fixings i got fries as my side they were perfectly cooked very crispy outside but not burnt they were salty with a lot of flavor i just wish there was a little more of them   it was a great lunch all around","826":"custard was pretty good whats shocking was it was 8pm on december 30th and there must have been 50 people in line seems the locals love it","837":"we tried izumi last night after reading the great reviews from here it was a great eating experience the place was small but had a comfotable feel and the waiter was great he explained everything in an upbeat fashion and his recommendations were stellar   we got various sushi dishes such as the rainbow roll passyunk roll spicy tuna and california roll which was the best sushi i had in the city to this point we will be returning soon to try different offerings","840":"i enjoy chickfilas spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries the quality of the food at this location is no different relative to other stores in the chain although it may have a smaller menu during lunch hours the long can get very long and it feels like they rush you away at the counter without much time to even put your money or credit card away on the bright side because they are so busy the wait isnt too long after you order its better to get this to go and eat in your car unless you have a table already since seating can be hard to come by","843":"go here if you visit stl we never realized what a huge property the brewery was until we took the beer school tour it was so much fun and we did learn quite a few tips on pouring and pairing beers with food they also gave us a little bud light souvenir glass to take home the museum gives you an insight into how the company came up and how they survived during the prohibition while you wait for your tour you can grab a bite and beer and roam around the lobby or chill at the biergarten  an excellent outdoor spot  on the way out we visited their gift shop and bought a growler filled with any beer of your choice what sets these growlers apart theyre thermos so they keep your beer cold for 24 hours and you get to choose between a black or stainless steel","846":"i love this place the jambalaya is as good as you will get around these parts  chicken and smoked sausage goodness the gumbos differ each week the mac and cheese is out of this world the tomatoe soup with pesto and croutons is the best i ever tried the shrimp po boy i ate today was fantastic the one problem i had today was service from the young woman who worked the counter i asked for a soda she ignored me twice i gave her my po boy order and she didnt put it in the guy who sat down next to me 10 minutes after i arrived got his order first so i checked to see whet my sandwich was and learn it wasnt even turned in the problem is the food is so good i have no choice but to put up with this employee who doesnt seem to care everyone else is great","847":"after perusing their menu for vegetarian goodies i decided to come here when i saw on their menu a garden sloppy joe  this vegetarian alternative was pretty good for a brewpub type of place  there are many items on their menu that have the vegetarian v next to it which means that ill need to stop in again during my 2 week stay  the waitress was friendly and helpful with my veggie questions","851":"great dinner tonight  tomato and crab salad had loads of fresh crabmeat and advocado spicy hoseradish roumelaude dip on the side  nice  the softshell crab pontchartrain was delectable  creamy sauce angel hair pasta and a devine deep fried softshell crab  yes the decor could be better but the food and staff make it very welcoming will return","856":"the decor may be old but every thing on the menu is great definitely a place when you want to fill up and have a good time with friends","863":"coffee syrup think maple syrup over ice cream  youll always find unique food items here  fabulous friendly helpful staff especially suzanna  tried  true favorites of mine  orange glazed chicken and sweet petite peas  they are known for always being in the top 510 cheap fine wines  a friend of mine her parents are from a dry county in tn wth is that  they always stock up on wine when in town their cereals in a box are some of the most delectable ever","873":"i had cucina zapata for the first time last week and it did not disappoint i ended up getting the capn crunch tilapia burrito and it was delicious it was a huge burrito stuffed to the max and only 6 my coworkers say cucina zapata is one of if not the best food trucks you can find by drexels campus and theyre not wrong however because of their popularity expect to wait a few minutes for your order the wait wasnt too bad but just be aware there might be a line to order as well as a line to pick up","878":"this publix is always clean and the staff always pleasant cashiers talk to you instead of being drones shelves always are well stocked and if out on a sale item are always happy to write a rain check always in and out quick never had to wait more than a few minutes in line staff always asks to help you out if you have a full buggy","880":"great place for wings and the staff is excellent the owner takes great pride in what he serves and realy put his best foot foward","886":"the staff was friendly and informative i had the chicken adobo which was excellent and delicious","892":"we went to the tyrone location after visiting the sarasota location many timesthe tyrone location is beautifully decorated the staff very friendly and the food delicious we went on a friday night and the restaurant was very busy but we got seated right away although the sarasota location is closer to our homewe will be back to the tyrone location while the sarasota location is perfectly goodthe tyrone location has a bit more going on","896":"they make the best birthday cake here lil pricey but their cake is very very exceptionally good their bakery is good too but also a lil pricey but well worth the extra couple bucks only downfall to this place is that the people in there dont really speak english and i have to point at stuff  lol other than than great place","898":"its a good locationi dont like the coffee at the place next door but combine a starbucks coffee with a tart from the other place and its a winwin well maybe not for my waist line or pocket book   i like they have large common tables with plenty of outlets under them for computers i really appreciate the multiple outlet on the walls too many people bogart every one of the power plugs but thats not going to happen here","899":"ive been in a few times now and i need to get my review in love this spot located right next door to my favorite homebrew shop great fermentations bier is always a good time they have growler fills every weekend with a huge line up each time from the dfg to the pumpkin ale they always impress only issue i have is that when itry their beers outside of the brewery i get something off maybe the beer line i dont know but i sure do enjoy their pint nights those are every third friday of the month they always have some yummy food truck or restaurant come in to serve up the masses stop in and see why they have won the state fair brewers cup a few times","903":"if you are a tea drinker this is the place for you     drinking tea is more then putting a bag in a cup of hot water  there is a process and there are tons of choices of tea leaves   plenty of knowlegable staff to help assist  tea is a bit expensive but then again we never purchased tea leaves before so maybe its reasonable  there are free samples  since this chain is part of starbucks you can use your star rewards to redeem tea leaves  definitely better then redeeming a cup of coffee","913":"my favorite reno lunch spot and has been for years  love their sandwiches and salads  deserts amazing too  nice ambiance  owner a doll  the only thing i dislike and dont understand is how bad the service is  waitresses are always so slow  i typically have to go track one down to take orderannoying  albeit they are  friendly","916":"great luxury institution of nashville the wait can be long but the atmosphere and vibe of the place is worth it we got the potato pancakes and eggs which were good as well as omelette apple sauce also came with it cooking here isnt fancy and reminds me of more of home cooking but great nonetheless","917":"we enjoyed both a great breakfast and a great lunch here recently our servers were friendly sweet and on their agame the very small kitchen has a little trouble keeping up with the demand of the closelypacked tables highest praise for the fried green tomatoes and the avocado bowl the caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan the oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread there were a couple of disappointments the coffee tasted as if it had been stewing too long and the pancakes werent warm when they hit the table but they were still tasty will definitely return","918":"i wasnt up for coffee so i opted for tea  i got the red velvet tea and it was so good  it was sweet enough where i didnt need to use honey  if youre not into coffee definitely check out the tea selection","920":"easy parking in a small corner strip mallfinding inside clean and tidyearly dinner hours and finding tables plentyas minutes pass customers steadily filing inmenu mixed with vietnamese and some standard americanchinese dishesfinding a bun bo hue on the menu and takingfew minutes and a big bowl delivered with the right side of vegetablestaking a sip of the broth and finding the soup very goodsqueeze of lime and adding the vegetables to the hot brothperfect balance of sour spicy salty and sweet flavors with the distinct lemon grass aromaplenty of fish cakestender pig knucklessoft cubes of pig blooda very good bun bo hue in reno for 970 after tax","922":"i walked in here not knowing where i was going or what kind of food they would have to offer very late around 1am on a friday night  boy am i glad i did so delicious i had the doner berlin with chicken and added chickpeas and lettuce to it along with the cabbage tomatoes onions cilantro feta  cucumbers that come on the doner alreadyit was incredible they call this a sandwich but this is like a gigantic pita only it has a more bread like yet crispy texture the spicy tzatziki sauce it comes with was so good i had to get more on the side   i cant wait to come back and try something else","923":"i like this place the server was great the food was good the whipped feta was great the pretzels were good and warm the fish and chips were crispy and hot the garcia pizza was eehhhh it needed something like salt or parm cheese idk but it lacked some flavor i tried a beermosa which was odd but not bad the menu is extensive and had many vegetarian options","924":"customer service is a huge deal to me  the manager was very receptive to my comment that always means a lot to me when managers try to keep their patrons happy  i can take comfort in knowing that im going somewhere where staff are always working on making patrons happy","926":"my coworkers and i have decided that we are going to do a bakery crawl every wednesday this week crawl for me at a little taste of heaven this place is right off of main st in edwardsville il this is a grab and go place parking lot across the street the bakery boasts chairs but only in their front window the owners greet the customers and it is a quick grab and go today we tried the cookies they had four different kinds in the case and after i got my order and man walked in and asked for the cookies that they were famous for just my luck they were coming out of the oven they are a tripleyes triple chocolate cookie i selected the blueberry almond cookie it was chocked full of blueberries i almost did not feel guilty eating it because it had two super foods blueberry and almonds we also got the chocolate chip this was a little crusty i am sure it would be a good dunking cookie but i only dunk basketballs not cookies finally we got the oatmeal raisin it was a nice cookie but i think my recipe is better the place lives up to its name bonus they do sell coffee to gono almond milk though","927":"this is nice little chinese bakery in the heart of philadelphias chinatown the female cashier was very friendly flirtatious and the pastries shown in nicely adorned display cases i stopped by early one evening had a sesame ball which was filled with bean paste the glutinous rice of the ball was nicely flavored similar to bai tang gao definitely as place worth stopping at if you are in the area","929":"i think that this was good i like applebees always i love applebees  i love the two for twenty love to save miney","930":"i had the bacon burrito it was very good size burrito for 4 it did not have much bacon but the green sauce was very good i would recommend this restaurant","931":"this place has the tastiest donuts around i recently had a coconut one that had this delectable cream in i mustve ate it too fast because it made me super sleepy i think i even fell down because when i woke up my bottom was super sore i highly recommend this place and when you go in look for this beautiful blonde lady behind the counter she was beyond nice and had the voice of an angel ronnie robbins  heir to the baskin robbins fortune","932":"not too bad just dont come here around 230ish they close between lunch and dinner my friend and i had gotten here around 2ish and soon after that we were told it was last call and that the hot foods and sushi would be taken away so i felt very rushed to get some more food it was a bit overwhelming especially since it was our first time there  now the food the sushi indeed was fresh i dont know what alyssa was talking about they had an okay variety but it seemed as though that every 3 rolls had some sort of crabmeat in it there was this triangle piece that i enjoyed i think it had salmon in it i had no problem with the tiny tongs for sushi i found them to be easier than the standard tongs  what made my day was the cold veggies the asparagus and green beans were out of this world okay so goes to a japanese buffet and raves about the veggies i do they were so fresh and crisp they had a mild seasoning and sesame seeds on them so yummy the chili wings were good as was the sesame crusted tuna i wish i had more time to look around  i do hope to check this place out another time maybe for dinner the one thing i wish they had were lemon wedges the server brought me lemon slices which were difficult to squeeze into my dish of soy sauce i really love the lemon soy sauce and wasabi combo for my sushi  the place was clean and very pretty the bathroom was immaculate also the staff were friendly and attentive oh the metal chopsticks were a plus","937":"coffee was ok timbits were tasty breakfast sandwich was awesome staff was friendly ran out of oatmeal but were accommodating to whatever food item i wanted in the store","947":"upscale place food is great here and next door at konas live music in the back at apris whole package you wont be disappointed","951":"this is an above average pizza place they dont try to be too fancy like other local joints just straight forward delicious pizza there are slices at a decent price their pies are more expensive than the chains but they are also much tastier to save a little there are daily carryout specials i havent tried the subs or other offerings yet but i look forward to it not much of a dining area but if youre looking for a good pizza to eat at home on the east side give this place a chance","956":"we found cyranos on yelp and since we were in the are looking for lunch we decided to give it a try    we ordered the spices bourbon collins for a beginning cocktailwould highly suggest it kinda like a ginger cookie with a bourbon flare  for appetizer we got the ahi tunadeeeelicious we then shared a beet salad another party in the mouth next was the cuban sandwich and we choose the slaw with it choosing to stay away from fattening fries i would not chose the slaw again but i am sure that is just a taste preference the sandwich however was amaziiiiiing    service was good and we would definitely eat here again i would like to try it for dinner next time","959":"topa topa amazing open space with great beers the weekender session ipa is my favorite beer in town i love the open tab system  however if you sit at the bar there is a serious bleach smell that is overwhelming from the glass dishwasher im not even sure bleach should be used in a high temperature dish cleaner since the high temp kills the bleachhope they can fix this its a major turn off when youre trying to enjoy the smell and taste of your beer","960":"amazing brunch spot in tucson the service was great as well as the food i will definently be going back","962":"had the pizza delivered to the hotel that i was staying and it took 45 mins the pizzas are large slices and very good my only problem was it was very oily","963":"the fountain on locust is a little hidden gem between cardinal and garrison aves  is it an ice cream  shop a sandwich shop or a cocktail bar  surprise its all three   we stopped by there for lunch today someday im going to go back and have one of their delicious looking ice cream martinis yes they have liquor in them  what a great country    mike decided on the cuban sandwich and i had the roast beef melt we both chose a small side of the polish pickle soup  they had other special soups today that also sounded delightful like the beef stroganoff soup    potato soup with dill pickles mixed in picklelicious mikes cuban sandwich was pork ham and cheese on french bread  they replaced the traditional sweet pickle on it with dill pickle   my roast beef had onions and white cheddar cheese on it and horseradish sauce  the sauce could have been a little tangier  the sandwiches were large and easily handled our hunger  we ended with a worlds smallest ice cream cone yum   of course we will be back","969":"we loved the original and used to be regulars surprised to find it is still here in a new location behind publix  so good great service and delish beal parma  serving local brews as well as craft","970":"pizza is made to order anyway you like it thin crust  very tasty line gets long at lunch but worth the wait","971":"good burgers not the best ever but pretty good for a restaurant burger extra points for the homemade buns gluten free and vegan options and creative choices the fries were good and the side salad was tasty too  all the choices make it kind of hard to choose id like to see them pare down the menu a bit focus on 510 burgers that they can really do well some of the choices are so similar too that i dont think itd be hard to edit  a bit  everyone was raving about the soda choice but no cheerwine wtf maybe cheerwine really doesnt exist outside of the carolinas there was a carolina burger on the menu suspicious that this would really be carolina style ie w pulled pork vinegar sauce and slaw on the burger but well have to see but no cheerwine that just doesnt seem right  the ice cream was also delicious i got a salted caramel shake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce every bit of it was delicious especially the chocolate sauce next time might need to get a sundae just for more of that sauce   bonus points for the spicy pickles","977":"i luv coming here if i am on my lunch hour  they are very good about getting the food and my check out so i am not late  i had the banzai burger done the right way and it was yummy i also like the loyalty program every time i come i try a new item and i have not been disappointed yet  staff is friendly","984":"this place is a cafeteria diner it reminds me of a soul food restaurant in texas called sweet georgia brown but with better decor and facilities you can walk through the line and select options for entree sides and dessert you may also order off the menu we ordered fried oysters fried catfish baked catfish mashed potatoes cabbage broccoli pasta side dish roasted potatoes and green beans cornbread was extra at 75 cents everything was delicious except the fried oysters the batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish the oyster was more battered versus breaded if the batter for the oysters was the same as the catfish they probably would have tasted great dinner with one entree and 2 meat platter was 1399 with 2 sides  definitely worth a visit for delicious food","985":"we love the craft cocktails and craft beers the food is hit and miss the batter on the fish and chips doesnt hold up its soggy and gross the quality of the fish is good but a new batter recipe is mandatory their classic burger is good and so are the fries","986":"fun and enjoyable place to sample unique wines sarah our host made the experience a wonderful occasion a must new stop on the winery trail try it youll like it","989":"delicious big burgers and generous portions of french fries customer service was really friendly as well","1001":"i brought my two littlest sisters here one rainy morning for precity museum nourishment  and we were very impressed by the creative confections at strange donuts from classics such as the fat steves and glazed dones to fun creations like the fetty wap and the gooey butter donut we had a great breakfast i definitely recommend getting here earlier than later to make sure you get first crack at the fun donuts and be sure to get enough to share because theyll disappear fast","1005":"i assumed brews meant beer  once i got over that i appreciated the donuts i mean donuts and beer would seriously be the greatest  pairing since pbj my friends assumed beer also we came for beer and stayed for the donuts which were amazing and giant but it wasnt memorable amazing it was ohh these are giant donuts they made in front of me me and friends ordered different ones so we could sample each others the establishment was cool but again i repeat there are no beers just nice people and donuts","1008":"if youre ever in the mood for an affordable and tasty poboy in the gentilly area make sure you stop at zimmers i spent a lot of time working in the gentilly areaupper 9th ward and used to stop into zimmers pretty frequently its a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush if youre in a rush it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you dont spend your entire lunch break waiting in line the staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes you actually forget how long you were waiting in line their marinated crab legsclaws are wonderful but for me their true standout is the crab cake patty poboy i truly feel like its the best seafood poboy in town its incredibly filling it has 34 crab cake patties and will only run you about 12 bucks    although i only have rave reviews about zimmers i am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours they are closed sundays and mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional mf 95 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of zimmers as you should","1011":"perfect little place to stop in for good food and drinks for an even better price  something you dont find everywhere  the fish tacos were good not the best but for the price and how quickly they were prepared i was very happy  my friends raved about their korean bbq tacos so if thats your type give em a try because you can at least know your wallet wont regret it  the bar and inside area fills up quickly with a crowd but outside is where its at anyway  they have it all set up without too much atmosphere so you and your friends can spread out","1012":"the longest continually run business in moorestown claims the owners a nice little deli and butcher shop on main street theres a few tables so you can sit down if you want to eat in a nice deli for sandwiches high quality butcher section as well in case you are looking for steaks or handcut bacon homemade soups take out frozen section salads and chips they go above and beyond with items like the softshell crab sandwich i didnt care for the bread they use but it will be a personal preference since my girl loves it its more a french soft bread than and italian loaf so its up to you still good sandwiches","1023":"this wendys is a good location open 24 hours for the midnight fry and frosty fix they are pretty busy all day long so they are constantly making food nonstop the downfall to the constant food production is that sometimes they make so much a burger may sit around and get luke warm i did just have a cool temp burger and nuggets however when i brought it the their attention they immediately made sure i got fresh hot and juicy food not a big deal but does need patience  since i ate inside it was not that big a deal if i went to the drive through and then hopped on the turnpike before i took a bite i would be very upset food quality was consistent with other wendys and the 4th star was for customer service and fixing the mistake like a pro","1024":"we enjoyed our visit to this cheddars  the restaurant was busy but we were seated immediately and not long after we were seated our waiter came for drink orders nick our waiter was very attentive polite and friendly yet professional  i did not see anyone working there that looked 14 so perhaps that is why i missed out on the love fest i would have filmed that for you all all but one of the employees i saw were kept busy and acted professional  there was one  a hostess i believe who was possibly bored  and decided to amuse herself by plastering her face to the glass partition while making a few fishy type faces at the diners while this may have counted as entertainment to some i would have preferred the love fest that i could have filmed admit it if i had been able to film that you would have watched i took off a star for the bad entertainment  other than that the place was clean the food was good and reasonably priced  nick was awesomei would recommend it to others","1025":"kanella had excellent appetizers  i would recommend the watermelon salad the rabbit and duck sausage the three dips and the boureki   the decor is nice and it feels truly greek but the noise levels are pretty high","1030":"crab ragoons need i say more   the highlight was the crab ragoons these were the best of my life they have a  large variety of asian cuisine here everyone can find something they like on their menu also i wanted to share that they have on stock my favorite beer from when i lived in china tsingtao","1034":"i noticed panaderia mi linda guatemala and stuck my nose in out of curiosity  the man behind the counter was so sweet i decided to give the place a try  baked goods were fresh in fact he was actively bringing trays out of the oven when i was there  there were a variety of traditional guatemalan choices availablebreads cakes pastries and cookies a guatemalan couple i met there recommended the cake and cookies with coffee which was also available i enjoyed the items i tried i loved the ownerwhat a doll  there was seating available and plenty of lot parking  very casual atmosphere","1038":"yet another fine hipster coffee shop in reno i am telling you kids reno is the new portland they have all the choices you would expect from a third wave coffee shop beautiful fully manual espresso machines that are intregrated into the counter and are droll worthy in their beauty and function chemex and v60 for pour over fans and freaks a selection of teas that is decent and some really gross versions of cronuts they also have some blends and concoctions that are good for the fans of the sugary bombs of starbucks and that ilk  the space is pure hipster simple clean subway tile and wood just a handful of tables inside and out and they have free wifi and clean bathrooms   baristas are way friendlier than the surly folks in sf and the west coast and the prices are cheaper too than in the usual hipster towns","1041":"awesome and cheap vietnamese food from the kitchen in the back you can call in your order in advance too ask for the buy10get1free card if youre a banh mi phamatic groannnn  also if for some reason sample every variety of boones farm maltwine beverage is on your bucket list get your ass here asap","1049":"im not a coffee connoisseur so im not reviewing it based on that what i am reviewing it on is the fantastic ambiance it has the free wifi and the long meeting table thats available for everyone  whenever i want to hang out and work downtown at a cafe roast is the first place i go to   my only real complaint is that during some hours this place is packed and so that may put a kink in your plans if you wanted to meet someone there for a meeting also wifi is sometimes touch and go i wish more cafes installed the fastest wifi with signal boosters around the place to make it more useful for those who telework  i also love that this place is open late","1051":"i stop here fairly frequently to pick up a few items on my way home from work  because of the time of day it is usually busy but its not too difficult to find a parking spot  it is the traditional acmesupermarket not the cheapest but the sales are good  the workers usually say hello to me throughout the store which is nice and they almost always have what im looking for  their greeting card section is a little sparse but you can usually find something to fit the bill  overall if youre in the area and need a place to go grocery shopping this acme is pretty solid","1053":"i enjoyed the food here i had the shrimp tom yum soup which had a kick to it but was really delicious and then the sweet potato tempura roll and the avocado roll and it was all delcious my friend enjoyed her meal as well although we both felt that it was a little too expensive and the parking lot is very small   the only downfall was the dessert which was honestly terrible i got the chocolate cake thing i cant remember its official name but it was recommended by the waitress and it was honestly just terrible the cake had obviously been microwaved and it was bland which was a feat to suck the flavor out of chocolate cake it had a scoop of ice cream on the side which tasted like it was a bit frost bitten and actually had chunks of ice in it not great  on the bright side the place is beautiful on the inside and the waitress was really friendly we had the same girl both times we were there and i liked her and can overlook the poor dessert recommendation   i would go back and just stick to the sushi and rolls","1056":"it took forever to be seated and its small cramped and hot inside on the plus side you can drink while you wait the server was really cool and very honest when we asked what was good and fresh for the day the food was cooked fresh  i mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you  we ordered lobster and rock crab both were amazing we also had the lobster bisque which i thought needed more flavor  the beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh service was outstanding once we actually got seated","1058":"i try to eat here every time im in philly because it is some of the best caribbean food ive ever had  i pretty much get the same thing every time jerk chicken with cabbage peas and rice and plantains but everything they serve is good from the basa fish to the brown stew chicken to the oxtails to the well you get the picture   and the pricetoportionsize ratio is awesome for eight bucks i get a styrofoam container with the meal i mentioned earlier that is so full it will barely close   the young lady who prepared our order on my most recent visit had to force the boxes closed and double bag them just so we could get them home without them bursting open  and we ordered the small portions  now as with any restaurant with good food it goes without saying that word travels  as a result this place is always packed always  the line remains at two lengths at the door or out the door  so if youre impatient or adhering to the fast food mentality when it comes to restaurants you may want to go elsewhere   but if you are willing to wait its oh so worth it","1062":"okay in general trader joe and i are good buddies there are things you can find cheaper here than at a larger chain supermarket and ive yet to find something of their brand that isnt decent   this one in particular is small but mighty theres a respectable wine and beer section quite the array of cheeses which is a huge reason you go to a trader joes type grocery lets be honest and solid offerings of both prepared or cut and whole produce  champagne grapes for cheap so happy   if this is just me im going to go ahead and say the rest of you are doing it wrong goat gouda come on","1065":"our intention was to go to rooster but the wait at noon on a sunday was 45 minutes crazy so i pulled out yelp to see what other downtown options i have and it suggested blondies i love the laid back attitude and funky furniture boyfriend had a bagel and cream cheese and a blueberry pancake off the kids menu he enjoyed himself i had the banana french toast very good but very sweet i think i would have enjoyed this as a half order and had something savory as well  loved the bottle service for mimosas had a 25 bottle of champagne and unlimited orange juice great juice we will be back for sure","1077":"good coffee great cheesecakes and ice cream awesome to be able to walk  bike to get a cuppa","1081":"great selection and tasty meats i went here to get a present for my brother and his girlfriend i was going to get them 6 filet mignons and i had a coupon for 12 free burgers with any purchase i went in and they accepted my coupon even though it was an online coupon and gave me other great deals as well i walked out with 12 sesame chicken breasts a beef stew 6 filets and 12 burgers all for under 50 which is well worth the quality of meat you get my brother was pleasantly surprised","1083":"ajs products are incredible fresh clean super just look at the labels and realize what you are getting you pay more but you pay for what you get and thats a lot want organics and quality incredible fruit and veggies section amazing beer and wine my mouth watered at the 450 bottle of dom perignon there is amazing looking sushi prepared fresh i bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread i have ever eaten the selection is amazing you will find things from all over the world they get rare and unusual items so it costs more   i dont think ajs is snobby i did get some weird looks from the employees when i showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes but i know what i want there and get great quality things that go into my body and there are better and better deals the more you show up just like any other grocery store id rather get some things here than anywhere else in town ajs is a place to explore more and there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line  which i love  i probably cant or wont shop here too often since you know i like to pay rent and bills and stuff but for specialty items and rarer beers and things this is the place its also fun to browse totally good times","1087":"pricey for burgers and beer but very tasty get the rooster sauce for your fries its a mayonaise flavored  sauce cool building and vibe with a modern industrial look would have given 5 stars if the beers offerings were larger for the price","1093":"i dont think there is anything in this place that is particularly healthy but i cant get enough of their pork belly slider  fantastic  donuts are really fine too  a good lunch spot","1099":"i feel like such a snot complaining about a starbucks the staff here is great my issue here is the guests there are a couple people that live here so if you were planning on sitting in one of the cozy chairs think again theyve basically claimed them as their own take a close look and you can see their ass prints in each seat seriously and on a nice afternoon theres usually 510 too many highschoolers hanging around they tend to sit outside around the cold stone next door which is a little bit of a relief where do these kids get money for starbucks everyday i was counting change to share a 1 slice at the local pizzeria but otherwise drinks made right every time also friendly and quick drivethru","1100":"had the rock crab oysters and sea urchin every dish tasted like heaven the beer was ice cold and the staff was so nice our pup joined us sitting outside and enjoyed a smidge of crab for herself i love this place","1106":"ive always liked banana pudding but the sweet life bakeshop made me a believer i had a craving for something sweet after visiting the liberty bell so quick yelp search led me here its a small bakery with seating for about five so many people probably get sweets to go and enjoy them in a nearby park  all of the banana pudding options looked amazing and i was having a really hard time deciding what to get but there was a friendly woman working there who patiently described each of the puddings to me i decided to go with the sundae pudding which was so tasty it wasnt overly sweet which was perfect for me i wish i lived in philly so i could come here all the time if youre in the area be sure to stop by and dont forget to check in on yelp because you get 20 off of your order","1107":"ive been by precinct in years past and clearly thought it was worth updating my experience we ordered take out so we could catch up on shows at home while noshing out  the line up 18 pepperoni pie 4 giant garlic knots they are more like mini loaves with sauce  although pickup is a bit of a pain in the butt where can you do a quick park  run in i anticpated this and brought my cutie to fly in  pick up while i drove through the roundabout to circle back to get him  the grub good plan  the verdict  super good nice amt of pep sauce cheesegood crust the garlic loaves were nice he sauce that came with them red was plentiful that usually never happens and was delicious i love sauce sauce  yum num","1109":"great food delicious burger and fries shake was good too fun environment i thought the food came really fast milkshake a little slower if you bring kids make sure they arent afraid of dim lights they dim them around 7 and noise as the restaurant is very noisy","1112":"this place has a very unique feel we nearly missed it on our walk to dinner theres no real label on the corner restaurant    they have an eccentric mix of ipas and pale ales the menu is very interesting as well their buffalo wings and the cavetelli appetizer were both amazingthe cavetelli was served al dente with amazing flavor i had the skate for my dinner which was probably the most delicious fish ive had in as long as i can remember   they are known for their burgers which were very good as well they are often compared to village whiskeys burger and sadly i dont think they are quite on par but still very good  this place is on the pricier side but the ambiance on a saturday night is a mixed crowd noisy and full of energy nicely done","1118":"consistently a good spot for lunch whether pickup or ordering in  solid food quick to make it can order through yelp directly  labeling of food for pickup sometimes off slightly but thats a slight problem that can usually get solved easily at time of pickup","1119":"this is a great vegan place to come and dine when i walked in i thought the place was especially clean and welcoming everything ive tried from this place i thought was delightful i have had the chicken burger ziggy burger their smoothie and the sweet potato fries if all vegetarian food tasted this good i would seriously consider becoming one","1120":"i have enjoyed everything i have ever had here the salmon is so fresh the steamed cold shrimp with cocktail sauce was so delicious and i dont even love shrimp but they were the best i ever had yeah seriously the girl at the counter said they will last a few days but  i will probably eat all of these tonight they were big ol shrimp no veins and delicious i might go back tomorrow and buy more  the girls there were very friendly and it was nice that they answered my questions and never get annoyed cause they were so busy but they are always friendly to all the customers  the lobster roll was good though i wish they made it with butter not mayo  i had the combo plate the flounder was good but the fries and shrimp had a moldy tasteawful  today after a long while i went back i bought a beautiful fresh lobster tail to make the best most succulent lobster roll ever and with butter i call this beauty angels lobster roll you should add it to your menu it will fly like hot cakes and i would buy it every week  thanks for your tips on how to broil the lobster","1122":"this place is always pretty darn busy the ambiance of the shop itself isnt amazing as a result as its mostly folks waiting around for their bubble tea but oh my goodness theyre fast and their red bean bubble tea was absolutely delicious upon my last visit red bean is always my favourite so i was pleasantly surprised that their version was even more delicious than expected","1124":"great food from the outside the building is kind of nondescript inside set up just like a diner lots of selection for breakfast lunch and dinner great service coffee and food really good would definitely go back","1134":"by far superseded all of my expectations i would pass by this place all the time thinking it was just your typical run of the mill pizza shop until i tried the food and boy was i sadly mistaken i was actually pissed off at my self for not going there sooner the food is incredible made fresh to order there are no microwaves in this hip joint  the pizza is off the wall the italians wouldnt believe what these guys can do with a little dough i highly recommend the buffalo chicken pizza it will blow your socks right off  the atmosphere is perfect  a bunch of hungry college kids looking for some good food and the prices are just right oh one more thing the chicken soup is a real winner i still havent been able to reproduce it  this soups is prepared fresh daily with super chunks of breasts of chicken so dont be shy use the scoop it straight  from the bottom and serve it up hot","1135":"the parking was fairly poor but its understandable because the place was packed the wait time was pretty short considering the large number of people there the air conditioning was pretty bad but cool enough to not be sweating the food was amazing the snow crab was very high quality as were the fries and the customer service was decent as was the cleanliness","1136":"the platter was very tasty and they give you more vegetables like onions peppers cucumbers and tomatoes compared to other places its not my favorite cart but still a good stand by i got the combo over rice with white and hot sauce plus a drink all for 500 ","1139":"this dunkin donuts is on us13 northbound however southbound access is available either via uturn at the next intersection or via the adjacent comcast parking lot from which theres a connecting lane this dunkin donuts is open 247 which is convenient for latenight or lateshift folks i didnt check the restroom but otherwise i could see no issue with this establishment the indoor seating area was clean and service was straightforward and efficient","1140":"our cabdriver from the airport told us last night to hit up the french market for authentic nawlins food so we did walked around for a bit and saw this place pretty simple menu i havent had a po boy yet so i ordered the buffalo shrimp po boy which came with fries and cole slaw the folks behind the counter were very friendly   he po boy was amazing granted i havent had one before to compare it with the shrimp was breaded just right the bread was soft and the hint of buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbs were perfect   the fries were breaded and seasoned just the way i liked it didnt have a chance to try the coleslaw because i think i forgot","1142":"axis pizza is very convenient its 24 hrs and within walking distance of two universities with that being said it still manages to produce meals that are surprisingly quality this place boasts about using fresh ingredients and youll see what they mean after your first bite   the food is simple good and fairly priced its my go to for late night meals and it hardly lets me down","1143":"new place good wings good sauces  no 5 stars bathroom smells and no napkins only a giant paper towel roll not very clean  customer service is hit and miss  again new place management should get the process down in a few months i will post again then","1146":"this place is like old ny meets the godfather meets golden girls  the parking lot is pretty small and from what we gathered is always packed  droves of people coming in and out most looking like pros who have been doing this for decades   upon walking in the market nobody greets you and nobody seems to care youre there  why you ask  because its an old italian market that lets their goods do the talking  the front room are where the meats live but thats not what we were after    give me the sandwiches  it was a good thing i decided to check out the menu online because once you go back and to the left it gets real  fast  you pick your deli number something so foreign to this atlanta girl but seems like its a must here in florida and wait for the chaos to begin  they take orders faster than you would imagine and before you can say forgettaboutit youre up  slightly panicked at the fast pace of it all i promptly ordered 5 sandwiches please feel free to judge me    while we waited for our babies to arrive we perused the prepared food section and decided on a fennel salad and chicken pasta  in less than 10 minutes our sandwich babies were born no really they were so heavy it was awesome  we also grabbed a fresh loaf of bread on the way to check out please  grab yourself one you can thank me later  they gave us our sandwiches in a shopping basket and when my friend asked the cashier where he could put it she said fairly dryly where you got it  we didnt even mind  we were just here for the sandwiches  out of all of the sandwiches 3 were meh but two standouts were the hot italian and the boars head blt  the magical bread that the blt is on makes the sandwich a homerun  its big messy and delicious  the fennel salad was not very good imo and the chicken pasta was just okay    oh and about that baguette  we couldnt eat it fast enough    overall i wont be running back but i will definitely return with modified expectations","1152":"good food family ok kids love it chicken buffalo pastrami  recommended take your time at lunch need 30 to 40 min","1156":"got the apple and bacon pizza it was really delicious but the toppings slid off the pizza really easy so you had to hold it really well to avoid that the outdoor seating was very nice and the heaters worked well the waitress seemed a little annoyed but it was not a big problem there was no wait on a sunday night so we were seated very quickly overall a nice experience","1157":"ate breakfast here 11132013 the line midmorning on a weekday was a bummer but testament to the popularity of the place  and for good reason forget everything else on the menu just be sure to order the sweet potato pancakes with the cinnamon cream its the best experience youll ever have with your clothes on service was prompt once seated if a little brusque dining area is clean and attractive food came out hot and well presented the eggs were fine the sausage nothing brilliant my partner had some southwest style cornmeal pancakes and loved them but forget all that the place is a 3 star rating at best but the pancakes make it a special meal","1161":"baileys range yet another great product from mr bailey   the choice of burgers is great whether you want beef bison or chicken  the beer selection is great loaded with alot of local craft beers the homemade dipping sauce are all unique and awesome  this restaurant is great for kidsi repeat great for kids","1172":"i dont get the chance to visit this location often but the time i was there went great prompt service good tasting drinks","1173":"was pretty impressed  i had the crab cakes wife had the quiche and daughter had the shrimp and grits all was really good i  was surprised place is so slow on a saturday  it has to be because nobody knows they are open we came over to see dinner menu come check it out people  no saturday breakfast lines ","1179":"tacos burritos french fries and milk shakes where else can you get such combos they even have breakfast quesadilla s with bacon in them this is my go to place whem im hunger and dont know where to eat","1184":"big fan of district they have such innovative donuts and i love seeing what they come up with next i have yet to try a slider but am just waiting for the time to come the coffee is great and you cant go wrong with a classic iced coffee i also tried their nitro cold brew doesnt have ice which was interesting not really sure what the deal with it was but it was good   they also have a great interior  a great design job at a restaurant really makes the place they employees all also seem generally happy and are great servers","1185":"fun place to go to catch up with friends pretty setting and have yet to be disappointed with food a little pricey but the food always seems quality had the small goat cheese salad tiny but ate up every single bit of it then shared cheesesteak egg rolls served with a horseradish sauce that was mild and not too overpowering finished off with my favorite dessert warm banana bread pudding they took it off the menu for about 6 months but now its back   parking is tight you can make reservations through yelp the weekends get very busy so do it while you can valet available for 5 dollars but at catelli","1186":"zios previously known as cesarinas is a largo staple this little bakeryitalian bistro is a marvel that must be experienced to be understood  when i tell you that the sandwiches are the size of your arm i am not joking should you get a meatball sub the meatballs are the size of croquet balls juicy and delicious  zios has about everything a guy could hope for in an italian shop","1194":"friendly helpful staff knowledgeable about their products delicious gelato and popcorn","1195":"smoothie attack  i rarely have smoothies so it was odd that i was craving one    their recipe is pretty simple yet so delicious and smooth yogurt a little fruit juice frozen fruit and a little honey to sweeten the dealor some variation of that  the hubby had the strawberry banana and i went with a peachy banana smoothie  both were delicious but i liked the peachy banana more it hit the spot divine    great cafe space with freewifi","1197":"came here once with friends and enjoyed the coconut margarita the creamiest tableside  guacamole made to my liking served with yummy fresh and warm thin tortilla chips and free churros i ordered a salad but the chicken was dry and the dressing requested on the side didnt please me i even asked for another dressing but still didnt quite hit the spot id definitely come back for the margaritas guacchips and churros though","1205":"i would have given 5 stars in the past and probably would give 5 stars to the chestnut location but recently i feel theres been a decline in quality  i went in recently and their signature crispy ranch was soggy with no crunch  their fries were great well seasoned  yet i felt the entire meal wasnt worth the 1450    i did have to walk 3 blocks which may have caused some of the issue with the sandwich  the fries and good customer service save this from being 3 stars in my mind but the price prevents it from a 5 star  avoid peak hours","1212":"this place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and i it was nice and convenient located very close to my wifes work on days that i would show up early to pick her up from work i would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself this practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years the quality of the smoothie bubble tea bar is 5star  about 1 year ago a taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit and we decided to try the actual restaurant they have plenty of the typical american chinese food such as orange chicken but our friend recommended actual taiwanese dishes the results were a little mixed some of the dishes were absolutely amazing while others were quite weird overall the quality was very good based on the opinion of our taiwanese friend even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone  to sum it up if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie you wont find much better in reno if you want to give legitimate taiwanese food a try this is a great place to start","1213":"went here after lunch at kitchen 519 got a ricotta cookie and a sticky bun that we were told had a danish filling but it was just a plain old sticky bun still good and def was eaten they had a multitude of cupcakes w all diff and eclectic flavors id like to try one next time","1214":"whites are nothing special chardonnay was decent reds have some really nice ones  try rossi della valle and the san giovese  white port is one to love   service was very kind and professional","1221":"byo mexican spot in northern liberties  came for brunch and the service was great food was delicious im a fan of chorizo and they highlight chorizo a lot in their dishes  bring some tequila and order some margarita mix","1223":"i am a huge fan of iron hill but since the closest one was in a half hour from me i didnt go often im glad they put one in voorhees it is much closer and much larger than the moorestown location   i went last night and it was packed but still had awesome service we had chris as our server and he took the time to explain in detail any of the beers we were looking at as well as suggest some he thought we might enjoy  i had the saison and raspberry wheat both of which were awesome if you like a little fruit to your beer we also had the wings and chicken tacos no complaints on those either very good the price is decent too we got out for 50 with five beers and the food","1228":"branched out passed manayunk and roxborough to east falls for some pizza  got the family special of large pizza buffalo chicken cheesesteak and wings with a 2 liter the pizza itself was better than average  there was a good amount of cheese on the pie  the sauce was tasty and well seasoned  it seemed like it had a hint of anchovies in the sauce  either that or garlic  the wings were excellent top notch  very hot even though it was take out which was hard to do  with several flavors to choose from we got the naked honey bbq  thy were meaty and massive  i def would return for the wings  a good sign upon walking in were the empty boxes of liscios rolls outside  the roll of course was fresh and soft while the chicken was chopped breast meat with a spicy hot sauce and gorgonzola  good sandwhich but not overfilling","1229":"finally got to check out this place over the weekend and was not disappointed came in for breakfast right after opening at 10am service was prompt and thankfully it wasnt too crowded i imagine that you have to make reservations relatively early given the size of the place and popularity though  ordered the greek coffee for myself which was tiny not sure if thats how its supposed to be but still tasty and unique with the coffee grounds in the cup my friend ordered the greek frappe which was creamy and delicious will definitely get that next time got the shakshouka which smelled amazing and was hearty and rich especially since i opted for the additional sausage was pleasantly surprised by the peppery spiciness my friend got the cypress breakfast which she said was delicious as well didnt take too long for the food to come overall but our server was very polite updated us on food status and refilled our water regularly  will definitely be back for the lunch options next time","1232":"i imagine this place gets super busy during the week but i stopped by for a weekend brunch and had no issues getting in delicious food pretty space ill be back","1234":"another good addition to the indy dining scene livery serves some delicious south american inspired food in a nice and lively setting cocktails are good too loved the empanadas cant wait to be back in a warmer weather so i can sit in their terrace upstairs","1236":"i had heard great things about cucina zapata and tried it this past week for the first time i tried the capn crunch crusted tilapia burrito and and the thai ice coffee with bubbles the burrito was really good  i loved the blend of flavors i enjoyed the thai ice coffee too and appreciated that they have the option to put bubbles in it the staff was also very friendly   the only reason i gave this food truck 4 stars instead of 5 is because the wait to get food can be a little too long i went here at around 130pm and had to wait about half an hour to get my food despite the fact that there were only 45 people in front of me in line will definitely go back there nonetheless","1245":"great food  good cocktails  decent service although  the staff could afford to dress distinctly different since its hard to identify them from they other customers  the bathrooms are a nightmare though  there simply are not enough when its busy which  it is frequently  kills the good experience","1247":"stopped by range burger today during jury duty   ive been wanting to go for a while and it was worth the wait delish burger with bacon jam great atmosphere and a variety of patrons the guy next to me had a chocolate shake that looked yum the fries were hand cut and the variety of dip sauces was awesome  i selected one and had the bartender choose my other two   really fun atmosphere  i will be back","1248":"im pretty impressed with this place healthy lunch large enough to save some for dinner not too expensive actual parking spaces whats not to like","1253":"found myself here after last call it was super crowded but the staff was great and the food hit the spot my burger was a little rarer than medium rare but i was into it fries were good crowd was annoying drunk and rude but the cook was cute so no complaints","1269":"love this bucks but the blonde with the red lips has a little bit of an attitude she might need to check","1275":"finally got a chance to try this place and im so glad i did i went for the elote mexican corn that i heard about and was happy that it was just as tasty and delicious as any ive had before i also tried a couple tacos they have a great selection with all different kinds of meats staff was friendly and the food was inexpensive and good not many tables to sit at but overall a great quick lunch spot","1279":"ok so i lied there is no falafel here went back and got the ziggy burger eh crispy chickn sandwhich amazing quinoa chili yum udon salad eh and sweet potato fries pretty good its nice to have the option of a vegetarian fast food place because who knows what some of those places put in the mean","1280":"had a great breakfast this morning met the manager nick great guy loved the fact that he took time to go out of his way to talk to me and ask how my dining experience was great spot for the locals as well as the tourists i had the big easy breakfast enough food for two the pancakes were excellent good fast service good food and overall good experience","1284":"came by for a late breakfast of blueberry pancakes they were great pancakes with the blueberries in the batter and blueberry syrup with blue berries in them also the three pancakes were huge and delicious it was all in cracker barrel style it was cool so the fire place was burning we will be back","1285":"cute little shop with a nice seating area out front tons of flavors to choose from and lots of extras too reasonable prices and very nice customer service my only complaint is that the ice wasnt quite as soft as i wouldve liked but it was still good and the ice cream was delicious too","1287":"i totally live in this target is only few minutes away from my house it has everything i need but the only reason why i give it 4 star is because theres is no starbucks but besides thats this is my favorite store ","1291":"i come here all the time never had a problem not sure what the other reviewers are talking about yes the store has aged but they do try and keep it looking its best never had a problem and i still enjoy my kmart exp","1292":"the secret to gigi and big r is not to order the fried chicken the fried chicken is still a very solid choice but nothing too special instead go with the jerk chicken its just a little bit spicy and its ohsotender and juicy   for sides i almost always go with the mac n cheese and the dirty rice the mac n cheese is much like the fried chicken very solid but nothing special however the dirty rice is amongst the best ive had and yes i have had bojangles  also skip the sandwich its justchicken between two slices of plain white bread get the platter   yes you can expect to wait for your food at gigis but its worth it","1297":"fast efficient service tasty coffee no complaints on my visit   i wouldnt want to be in the drive thru must have been a line 15 cars long hello people walk your buns inside","1301":"my first visit was yesterday the line and wait was ok only took about 10 minutes i ordered the regular red velvetnot the vegan one and a vanilla milk chocolate the red velvet had a good flavor the cream cheese icing was good the icing to cake ratio was a little unbalanced there was way more icing than cake the cake was still good though not everyones red velvet cupcakes are good the milk chocolate cupcake had a milk chocolate icing and vanilla cake the icing was good the cake was kind of hard and dry my fiance ordered the banana cupcake with vanilla icing it was interesting the cake had real bananas inside and tasted like banana bread with icing it was ok wouldnt get it again overall everyone was very nice love the way the place looks they have a cupcake atm in the front of the building which is pretty cool the presentation of the cupcakes are awesome the cupcakes were just ok nothing to brag about from the cupcakes i tasted i still think cupcake collection has the best i will definitely return to try a different cupcake and even their ice cream","1302":"i loves me some tjs just an overall comment im sure everyone knows dont fall in love with any product you buy at a tjs because they may discontinue it without warning this location has the same great friendly service ive come to enjoy from all tjs and the foods good too  beer","1308":"honestly this is my favorite place to get pizza but there are a few little issues that keeps me from giving it 5 stars one is how much everything costs it is worth it but i still feel like the only reason why i dont order there often is that sometimes the good stuff is around 30 for one pizza my other reason is that sometimes the food will get to you undercooked and that is based on how many toppings it has since they seem to put  all the food items in the same oven for the same amount of time","1309":"you know the place must have good food when the average bmi of their patrons is 42   south jersey has diners galore which one to choose which one to chooooose oh the options picked meadows diner based on the reviews and was not disappointed   came in at 1030ish on a saturday morning and while busy i was still seated promptly and with a smile service was slightly lacking for refills on water but heeeeeey its jersey i had the french toast w italian sausage which was homemade and very authentic not to mention spicy the french toast was fluffy but a bit cold boyfriend had some sort of artery clogging omelet which was very tasty but im sure it was about 5000 calories heeeeeeey its jersey   overall i good place to eat really fattening foods to give you the serious itis for about 12 hours 50 for 5 people","1311":"stopped in to beat the morning heat and grab an iced coffee 10 seconds inside and you could tell this is wear the locals go to meet up and enjoy great coffee and a bite to eat i cant speak to the food but the coffee was excellent and the service left nothing to want","1312":"have to say this hipster hangout surprised me love the decor easy and comfy the menu is good i got the special chicken and toast the blueberry topping was kinda bland needed to be sweeter the chicken had a nice surprising heat the waiter joel was good very knowledgable well spoken knew his menu i love all the cocktails the coffee comes hot or iced which is nice in arizona i love that they bring a big container of water to the table same with the creamer they arent cheap love that they are dog friendly   very nice brunch will be back and will bring people","1316":"my medical office had our christmas party in 2016 at the depot craft brewery distillery  food was excellent  employees were courteous and professional  we were in the upstairs large group gathering room which was awesome we had a bartender and servers all to ourselves  did i mention the food was excellent  only con parking for us arriving at 5 pm was waaaaaaaay in the back behind the building and it was raining that night  ","1317":"good greek food  best gyro ive had in florida  good greek salad but it only had two olives and one slice of pepper  the rice saganaki and spanikopita were excellent but the green beans were canned  overall worth going to","1319":"decent place to study work and what have you awesome friendly and smiley staff moderately priced cafe fare ample tables and outlets hands down one of my fav cafes in philly","1322":"i wish there was a way to give half stars  bottleworks would be a 35 in my book but i am going to round up mainly in tribute to my husbands love of this place as well as appropriate weight given to the excellent beer  i have a love hate relationship with this place  love is the beer which is  stellar as expected for schlafly and hanging out in the bar with a live band is definitely a good time though i could do without the smoke  the festivals are also outstanding prohibition  the major problem i have with bottleworks is the inconsistency of the food  some days its solid and satisfying  i love the multigrain including quinoa  pilaf they have available as a side  other days you end up with burnt dried out beer bread and poorly seasoned food  i never know what day its going to be so i am wary  i have never understood this since i have never had a bad meal at the tap room which i assume is run by the same group    it seems the bad days are lessening but they still sneak in there  this having been said i still come here pretty regularly given my husband is a huge fan and i always love the beer  when in doubt drink","1323":"we found ourselves in need of a snack after disappointing food selection at a festival wed attended and saw great reviews of the bahn mi here  we were not disappointed  we did the grilled chicken bahn mi and the brians special grilled pork with egg  both were on wonderfully fresh bread loaded with lightly pickled daikon and carrot i could eat these veggies by the pound  the filling to bread ratio was good and my dining buddies appreciated that the herbs and jalepenos came on the side  i appreciated it too since i ended up with everyones cilantro    the child who eats almost nothing seriously she wont eat chicken decided pho sounded good  when her tummy got full we ended up with about half the portion  as we were eating we noticed some interesting ingredients in the pho and asked her what she had told the cashier when she ordered  shes never been one for bothering to read very closely or taking out her ear buds when ordering and apparently she requested with everything  including tripe and tendon  when we pointed this out she shrugged and said oh i wondered what that was  tasted pretty good  so well done seasons  you got someone who refuses to eat poultry and most veggies to blithely scarf down tripe and proclaim it pretty good  no small feat","1326":"great hot pizzaeven at 2 am in broad ripple  the only thing i used to get here were the breadstix with cheese and ranch  definitely glad i can now add pizza to the repertoire","1328":"peter piper on roids good pizza","1330":"great little starbucks hubs and i came across when we were visiting nola great neighborhood clean and great service","1331":"this is an outstanding italian market friendly staff  takes me back to childhood days and all the italian markets i shopped at with my grandparents  very old world  lots of goodies to find  many rooms filled with italian culture  they offer 1 gluten free pastry at the bakery counter its a chocolate moose cake out standing  no gluten free pizza which is sad and i hope they change soon  there were prepackaged cookies and gluten free italian items to be found  it was my first visit i am planning a second very soon","1334":"ive been here a few times and its a really good sushi spot   the buffet is ok and id recommend sitting at the bar for the best service not the best place for kids unless they really like sushi","1335":"loved it the woman was very nice i believe her name was tracy most restaurants i go to value money over customers appreciation it is not the case for sweet taco\u2122 they took our coupon even though they didnt have to i would recommend getting a burrito and then some doughnuts","1336":"opaaaa  great greek food and atmosphere  this is definitely authentic  we got two gyro platters great and a chicken souvlaki probably even better big chunks of chicken  the fries were outstanding  didnt get a greek salad or a flaming cheese on this trip but they looked great  huge restaurant welldecorated in the eclectic tacky greek authenticity and attached to an outstanding bakery  the prices are a bit high compared to some of the other options nearby but you cant go wrong with a meal at hellas","1339":"its bigger than staples and only filled with alcohol and accessories and a tasting station so many different types of wine beer and spirits to try you wont get bored here  given the size i assumed it was a chain of liquor stores it may be in the future but i was surprised to find that there are only two locations in alberta and theyre both in edmonton holy toledo yelpman howd they pull that one off and in the burbs too burb living must be like small town living there isnt all that much to do so you drink with your neighbours  anyway there are entire aisles dedicated to just about every kind of alcohol you could want plus a few spots to pick up any little bartending accessories you might need to look like you know what youre doing you know shakers and bottle openers of various sorts and things  like any craft and hobby store like craft cocktails and drinking as a hobby its a thing the staff all seem to be knowledgeable on the products they stock and able to give suggestions or creative solutions for whatever occasion youre stocking up for","1347":"i recently went to the new  coffee house on mt rose street and i was amazed delighted and just down right thrilled to see what a wonderful change they have made to the place it is actually comforting to walk into the coffeebar the decor is wonderful and it very open and airy the staff is amazing they all seem to feel excitement about this business and they want to share that excitement with everyone who comes in i am a chai fan and so i have tried the coconut chai the aftertaste is like eating a piece of fresh coconut meat i also tried the rooibos chai and it was simply amazing the flavor was so wonderful that when i was done i wanted to go back and get another one right then they have several other chais but i loved the rooibos so much i am hesitant to try another but maybe they just get better as i go looking forward to another stop at the coffeebar","1353":"not a bad place to try out some authentic taiwanese cuisine service could be better and parking situation also needs improvement","1358":"nice cafeteria like place the menu is very limited its a different take on tacos kind of like southern food in a soft taco shell the shrimp corn chowder soup was delish also","1361":"this is my neighborhood cafe and its everything i want casual dining friendly service dogfriendly outdoor patio and good food in some ways ghinis reminds me of the hotel congress cup cafe but quieter and more laidback ive been here for breakfast lunch and desserts ghinis is a popular place with a solid reputationand the bakery next door is a favorite too im awarding the cafe four stars instead of five because the place does get a little chaotic during the peak times again just like the cup and i can see how a firsttime visitor might find that offputting all in all i recommend you try ghinis and discover one of tucsons delights enjoy","1363":"soooo good  the dishes were light fresh and had really excellent mixes of flavors and textures  the fried cheese i forget what all the dishes were called was great salty and a little crispy over a chopped salad that had a little mint and cilantro in it i think  the yogurtlemon mousse was a perfect summer dessert  very lemony which i love  the waiter was nice and outside seating is always appreciated  stop at the foodery on your way over and mix a six or bring a bottle of wine  i give it 4 stars instead of 5 bc it was a bit pricey but the lunch menu looked good and cheaper","1365":"this bakery  pastry shop is located in the reading market i stopped by for breakfast and purchased 2 items carrot cake and tiramisu match this with a cafe from old city coffee and you are in for a treat these two left me full and ready for the day thankfully its was a very active day and it helped me avoid the sugar crash this was also because these items were not over sweet and rich in flavour i can not enjoy something that is too sweet and lacking in flavour i will return to try the lemonciello pecan diamonds and pasticcios  check this place out in the reading market youll like it","1370":"we went there on a monday since we had a coupon and didnt want to be those people and go on a weekend service was beyond excellent salad bar was fantastic and the meats are awesome get the lamb shankoooo man thats tasty just make sure to be hungry because there is nothing small going on in that place  we ride the short bus apparently and the coupon we had was for the place down the street they were so cool about it that the still gave us 25 off the bill how awesome is that well be back for sure","1371":"mmmm breakfast i love it i love everything about it and ghinis for the most part didnt disappoint   this morning i had a sort of create your own combo i did two scrambled eggs with chopped up basil folded in hashbrowns and biscuits with apricot jam the eggs were incredible fluffy yet firm but not overcooked the basil was a perfect addition to fill out the flavor of otherwise bland eggs the biscuits were pretty much out of this world im going to say they were the best biscuits ive ever had and the jam oh the jam dont even get me started the hashbrowns on the other hand feel short not much flavor soft and sort of cold i asked for them well done but that didnt really happen and that bummed me out a little   service was a little off too it was busy crazy busy so i imagine they were strapped to get people seated and get food in their mouths timely but i had to wait a little longer for a server to come over once he took my order though everything moved along like clock work and so ill hit em up again it was breakfast well done and next time ill make sure the hashbrowns are well done too","1376":"popped in on a humbug with one of my besties never heard of the place but had a sweet tooth i had a smoothie tropical something and was quite happy it was pretty tasty the manager was really friendly and accommodating and talking my friend into trying the icecream she picked the butter pecan and that ended up in an eye roll towards heaven needless to say she was sold on getting something as well got some strawberry cheesecake to go and im super happy definitely will we going back","1382":"this a great little coffee shop that has great coffee and espresso great place to grab a coffee and get some work done if necessary i will definitely be stopping by again to get some iced coffee or cappuccino when im in town","1388":"we love ajs the specialty food selections are outstanding we love to get a light dinner and eat on the patio tonight we enjoyed soup and salads the service experience at the deli counter is sort of hit and miss tonight they were understaffed  we will be back   first of all the service at the deli was much improved since our last visit  tonight was another fun dinner on the patio we enjoyed the fountain while enjoying our meal of turkey chili and the ny steak dinner we will be back","1395":"i almost always get combo 5 with the juicy delicious 500 burger truffle fries and refreshing birch beer love the truffle fries   i used to get food here at least once every two weeks but the prices have gone up especially for the fries its amazing how a 2 increase can change my eating pattern its still one of the better burger places in center city with a relatively reasonable price if you havent tried 500 degrees yet you should before the price goes up again","1399":"cant beat the price for the dixie cup filled with happiness  the classics cherry chocolate and pineapple flavors all winners  if im in the mood for their gelati i get the chocolate water ice with rasberry ice cream  they have off menu items such as rasberry choco chip ice cream vanilla birthday cake and vanilla peanut butter  all winners  summer is right around the corner and ill be sitting on my stoop enjoying one of these bad boys","1410":"large menu selection with reasonably good vietnamese dishes they serve the only real b\u00e1nh m\u00ec in town however the vietnamese coffee should be prepared with condensed milk as advertised on the menu but unfortunately it is not friendly and relaxed atmosphere good service","1413":"came here for a small bite since we were just passing some time and decided to get some sliders   they have a regular sliders cheeseburger fried chicken on the board and daily ones pork belly fried oyster blackened chicken caesar on a menu  we decided on the fried chicken sliders fried oyster and the pork belly sliders   fried chicken was delicious  perfectly fried not too heavy  their was a nice kick on the chicken along with some jalape\u00f1o and a nice slaw to go with it  fried oyster was good too nicely battered cornmeal crusted and fried  not at all greasy  you can still taste the oyster the pork belly was decent  just as youd expect from fatty pork belly with pickled onions  as you can see i went from the favourite to least favourite even though the least favourite is still pretty good  the sliders are pretty small so expect yourself to order multiple  no shame  and at around 3505 why not  the inside of this place is open and airy  theres even outdoor seating in the back  i feel like this place could be on cap hill somewhat of a hipster vibe but i liked it  didnt get the donuts but they definitely had a good selection of them  next time must get both","1415":"generally a great starbucks there are large amounts of seating inside including both tables and comfier options including leather chairs and sofas the outside seating is nice but the ambiance is disrupted by large amount of traffic on hazel dell and 116th  the staff is generally really friendly and the service is quick this place is crazy on the weekends with 10 cars waiting for the drive through so i would definitely park and stand in the line inside its generally a shorter wait  as starbucks go this is a good one","1416":"i like what this place does the food is good the service was excellent and its a sort of twist on greek food owner was very nice and helpful kinda tucked away off nolensville but easy to find i recommend the falafel and hummus","1418":"step out of your comfort zone and try this restaurant  you wont be disappointed  i drive by this location often while on the road for work and decided to make a go for it today  i was dining alone so it can be a little uncomfortable walking into the unknown  the staff was very friendly  answered all of my questions and had my food ready quickly i was greeted with a nice warm basket of pita and pickles pickled veggies  i ordered foule from the appetizer menu which consists of whole chick peas spices lemon juice and some of the best olive oil i have ever had the pleasure of tasting  it was so rich in flavor and color i enjoyed it with the warm pita  next was my chicken kabob sandwich which was nice hearty chunks of grilled chicken green and red peppers rolled into another large pita its alot of food so more than likely you will be asking for a to go box the atmosphere was nice and clean and i can not wait to try more menu items","1421":"the fried chicken is really good here i know that sounds weird that a donut place has fried chicken but not to people that live in philly and know about federal donuts the location in nolibs is on a sketchy street with nothing else around it the donuts are really good too but the fried chicken is the star here","1424":"been here a few times since my gf and i live by and like the outdoor seating area the regular menu has always been pretty consistent with their fish  chips and old charlestown shrimp appetizers are a bit expensive for what you get but they are good the staff has always been nice and offer to bring out water for our dog when bring him so thats huge for us   we finally realized they had a happy hour and walked away with mixed results the menu has a good selection between food and drinks at different prices we had a few food items including the baja tacos nachos and calamari the one baja taco for 5 reg 750 was good but for 5 i personally hoped for more than one or for something special with the tortilla the fish itself was pretty damn good but the tortilla tasted fresh from the supermarket having been spoiled by fresh tortillas elsewhere this was disappointing the nachos plate was packed but the plate was small so all the cheese and few beans were on top with nothing on the chips hidden below but the calamari was very good and came with a good amount   i would stick with the regular menu or if happy hour has to be tried stick with the drinks and calamari","1428":"well i cant lie they were definitely goodi got the bacon  eggs 3 pancakes bacon and 3 eggs which were great my bf got the caribbean pancakes pancakes w bananas walnuts coconut shavings and powered sugar  side of grits the grits were my favoriteall super butteryand i dont even like grits while everything was good and i would surely go back and try other things i think a lot of it is hype its good but people make it sound glorious and orgasmic ive had better pancakes that just melted in my mouth literally elsewhere but for the overall experience id say its good but its not the hype people make it to be but id def go back  ps we saw reese witherspoon there","1433":"this place is very crowded  the prices are reasonable  we had two omelets and two coffees  the food was good but not great  the eggs were overcooked and the cheese very light so nothing to cover up the overcooked eggs  coffee was fine for an all you drink setup    four stars because the service was quick and friendly","1439":"went in about 10pm on a saturday night no wait  the place was pretty empty  we had very prompt attentive service  get ready their drink menu is really impressive and extensive    food    me  lgbt burger  goat cheese bacon   my son  daves smoked  cold smoked patty fontina cheese caramelized onions  the bf  ozark  mushrooms black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions  my sons friend  the basic  basic burger  1 for cheese  all of the burgers were excellent  i can only speak for myself so first of all all of our food came out hot the buns are made inhouse and were delicious  super tasty nicely toasted and crispy yet soft  i wanted to take some home with me  the combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect  i loved it  it did not need anything else  i did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries separate purchase and it was pretty good but not necessary  burgers were a pretty good size  they were smaller than the bun but still a good size  worth the price  sure this was a quality burger  my only gripe however is that the price did not include fries see below  no one left a morsel on their plates  my sons friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strangeno one should eat that fast  sides  we ordered two large french fries 4 each to share between four people and it was exactly enough  you have a choice of sauces   i was not impressed at all  they were just fries and honestly with burgers starting at about 8 these fries should come with the burgers  i need to have french fries with my burger so i will pay every time but suggest that they rethink this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries  these are not worth the extra 24  we also had the cheese curds  ok not what i was expecting but it was good  not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples  the breadcrackers however were a nightmare almost funny  they crumbled because they were so thin  almost like lace  they really should be a little thicker  again it was good but cmon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the breadcracker    the boys had ice cream but i wont comment because i did not taste it  i was too full from the burger  hope to on the next trip    overall we had a great time  service was stellar the place itself is very cute but i can see how it may be a little awkward if its packed especially sitting at the communal table   next time we are in st louis we will definitely be making a return trip to baileys range","1448":"good deal if you get the large order for like 35 dollars definitely worth splitting among your friends","1456":"great place for families and food is fantastic the recipes are creative and original weve been there several times and always have a great experience","1457":"quality sushi and such great eclectic decor make for a very nice dinner experience  beatles music plays constantly and between the modern oriental wall decor are pictures of john lennon everywhere  my date and i ordered the love boat for two  there was enough sushi and sashimi to stuff us both to the gills  the miso soup is very flavorful a far cry from many bland misos i have had  i would recommend with the warning that it is pricy compared to other sushi restaurants","1463":"very convenient for some craving or emergency cooking needs  their prices are higher but they try to carry more specialty items i have never noticed this but ive heard from others in my building to always ask for a receipt just in case the charge comes over wrong  i highly recommend checking this place out to find new and exotic choices you wouldnt usually see or think to buy  the fact that it is in downtown is one of the most appealing aspects to this place","1466":"went there for their anniversary event they have a pool table and some arcade games all their beers are on tap and for sale great place to hang out tours of the brewing area are also available","1467":"great sandwiches and service fast and friendly service had the spicy philly flavorful and fresh ingredients","1471":"i love coming here after work its honestly the only burger place i approve of thats in the city its way better and way bigger burgers than shake shack i absolutely recommend the up side burger its definitely worth the money and if you have spare change absolutely get original fries and a fountain soda they have berch beer   and orange cream ","1472":"jaki c promised me mrs k would like the place  so  the mrs  chip k his mrs k and myself went to izakaya  jacki warned about the kinks and yes they have them  they only had one fry cook and heshe was overwhelmed to say the least  the place was not crowded but with the variety on the menu would be daunting for one person  we managed to spend 91  dont know how things that cost 2 to 7 works out to that much but it did  i had a california roll chicken on a stick one with sauce and one with salt and pepper also had a beef stick and pork belly with asparagus wow was that good  with a chaser of calamari  sounds like a lot of food but the meat on a stick is one bite per person   my best dish of the night was the beef on a stick  tender moist with a slight chewiness that was perfect  it was fantastic  wife had the shrimp tempura and it looked great and she said it was good  so super slow food coming out of the kitchen knocked the review down one   really cant wait to go again","1474":"awesome little dessert place with teeny little cupcakes think portion control if youre dieting and huge slices of cake if youre not dieting they also have dessert bars too they serve coffee tea wine and beer table service was a nice surprise prices were reasonable for what you get coffee was very good  and refills on the house it was a little loud with all the tables and counter seats full  kind of made it hard to hold a conversation with my friend without shouting at each other if it werent for that i would have given a 5 star rating other than that it was awesome be sure to try a salted caramel biteor 2or 3 they even have a pupcake you can buy for your puppynice touch for dog lovers","1477":"my wife and i have shopped here for years they have the best available produce all the time  local when available and best source otherwise we picked up sweet corn today and it was from georgia last time it was california sweet corn because that was all that was available the main reason we stopped was for georgia peaches mmmm they also have a small greenhouse and plants throughout the growing season","1481":"i love this place its an adorable little coffee shop on third street in old city its a small but fairly well designed space with plenty of seating and room for people the seating area has all your typical coffee house style seats such has tables bars and reading chairs they have all your typical coffee house fair as well bagels and sandwiches i have been here quite a few times and its all pretty good very friendly staff as well","1484":"for a casual burger place 500 degrees delivers on taste quality service and speed you can get a 5 star burger in a 3 star amount of time its so impressive  their selection is truly outstanding you have your choice of patties cheeses toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires i believe there are some suggestions as well if youre not feeling particularly creative that day   the last time we were there my boyfriend got the kobe beef burger thick cut applewood smoked bacon a fried egg and vermont cheddar cheese he was knocked to the floor and has been telling everyone about it ever since i got a simple beef patty with cheese and bbq sauce maybe i need to be a bit more adventurous next time nonetheless i still loved my burger  another great thing about 500 degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil its just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy french fries   ive always had stellar service here i loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what i wanted off of the menu i blame it on the rain brain  my only gripe about 500 degrees is that it can get a little pricey for burgers fries and drinks for 2 we paid about 28 that included one kobe beef patty but even without it youre going to pay a sitdown price for what is really a takeout burger the quality justifies this in many ways so well definitely be back save your pennies and splurge","1487":"nice that says it finest greek food and service all around you is a family atmosphere greek style you can make a meal on the appetizers alone  my suggestions are as follows  1 kria piklilla  cold sampler platter  1595 can feed a family of at least 6  2 grilled vegetable sampler 895  each of these will fill you up thats a family of 6 im talking about  my friend nicki suggested i try saghanaki greek cheese pan fried then flambeed with a shot of ouzo she was right awesome  my son ordered the vegetarian gyro he loved it i topped it all off with a traditional greek pound cake soaked with orange liquor delicious  probably the best part of this restaurant is the fact my son strict vegetarian  and i meat  fish eater  can both enjoy dozens of choices from both menus thats rare in a restaurant its usually meatfish oriented with one or two non meat choices   great time great service i suggest reservations","1489":"great gelateria on grand also a cafe but did not try their coffee nice cozy atmosphere cute patio and friendly service  the salty caramel is out of this world being a connoisseur of this flavor i would even go so far as to say it is possibly the best salty caramel flavor iced dessert concoction that i have ever had the pistachio raspberry and lemon are also pretty darn good  they set up with their gelato cart at tower grove farmers market saturday mornings i am pretty sure that gelato is an acceptable breakfast food especially on a hot summer day  also they have cheerwine and sun drop which ive never seen outside of the carolinas","1496":"was recommended by a friend to try out this place when visitng santa barbara the wait was worth it everything they had was live price is pretty decent for the uni   got the clam chowder uni with svallop and bisq bowl the uni was super fresh and not fishyi would definitely come back and try other food they have when im back in santa barbara","1508":"went here for the first time last weekend called ahead to try and make a reservation but they only do those for groups of 6 or more being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes we chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait i had the cocktail featuring egg whites and it was very very tasty compares well to some similar cocktails ive had at thunderbird once we finally were seated the food was all delicious the crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing and reminded me of the flavor of bugles the skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops  the food and drinks were awesome and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by  final note if you do sit at the upstairs bar next to a door be forewarned that the door will bump you repeatedly as management and staff access the closet during the night it becomes more annoying the longer you sit there because its unavoidable and a terrible design flaw","1518":"cool joint super friendly staff that is more than happy to let you sample everything before you buy its like a free flight","1522":"baileys range has interesting burgers for any type of person all the food is good and so are the drinks and milkshakes the service at the range has always been phenomenal for me very friendly and efficient","1523":"4  very good selection for both cats  dogs  id describe concord as taking braxtons   petsmart and smashing them together","1525":"well i must say i was highly impressed by baileys range  the menu specifically was most impressive  it was very hard to decide what to get cause everything looked great   the server was very friendly prompt and attentive   the food tasted fantastic and was cooked just as we ordered it the two reasons i didnt give five stars   first  the burgers were a little smallish for their price  if im paying 10 for a burger i want something substantial and i found the amount of meat a little lacking second  while i realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people cause the place was pretty crowded it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready and while i understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients bottom line is i think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal and burgers should be a little quicker than that","1533":"really liked the interior set up and d\u00e9cor tall private booths with a sports and breakfast food theme very clean i got the pancake combo the eggs were fine bacon cooked perfectly hash browns too greasy but the cakes were super light a little fluffy and buttery perfectly prepared my wife got eggs benedict and said among the price levels places similar to this one they are the best she has had in indy thats saying something because its the only thing she orders for breakfast fruit was fresh staff was great super friendly and on the ball service was quick the place is really big so we didnt have to wait long to be seated prices are what youd expect","1534":"14 layer eggplant was light and tasty pure eggplant with tomato sauce and a little bit of cheese highly recommended their lasagna is supposed to be one of their famous dishes as well but it is on the heartier side   atmosphere is nice we sat on a chilly night in the room with a fireplace it was cozy also great location right on the delaware river it seems like a more middle aged clientele its not really a hot new restaurant more of a conservative nice laid back place myself and my friend were the only people under 45 im guessing","1535":"the owner frank is super nice and always willing to look into ordering beer you want if they dont currently have it they dont have a huge food menu but what they do have is good i mostly go for the beer they have one of the best selections around the shop is clean open late and has a small parking lot outback they also have tables so you can sit and eat","1538":"an upscale mexican joint really i enjoy good authentic mexican food this is by far the most upscale ive seen  im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type so this was different than what im used to   the atmosphere at besito is tough to beat they have merengue  salsa on the background which doesnt really go with the mexican theme but whos paying attention an ideal date night atmosphere for sure   food was very good but i must say a bit on the pricey side you have to consider the fact that you are paying for more than a meal you have the valet outside truly great service our waiter was friendly and happy to discuss the menu he more than met our expectations   guess if you and your date love mexican food and feel like taking it to another level for once besito is your place its a gourmet mexican restaurant certainly worth trying","1548":"the opa at wem is worlds apart from the others definitely the best greek fast food spot in town i get the 5 with the pita wrap and french fries  yes french fries not very greek i know but seriously these are no mccain potato sticks theyre close to the best ive ever had you can also get a mean fried calamari plate here who knew   i dont think the one on whyte even serves appies like that this franchise is run by francis a super sweet lady who takes pride in keeping a very clean restaurant it has more the feel of an intimate little restaurant than a fast food chain when i feel like opa i head to wem their pita bread is so yummy and fresh and their tzatziki is to die for","1550":"there is real quality  there the caveat they use a lot of canola oil which no 1st  class bakery would but on the other hand they will make with real butter and do if you call ahead and those products are very fine","1556":"i dont know why jjt has such a crummy star rating on yelp this place is great   its cozy cute serves delish coffee and has yummy biscotti on the side i love the independent coffee shop vibe and i love that they have open mic nights on friday when i want to check out and relax i come here for a bit its also perfect on a snowy day  just know its a 10 minimum to use a cc","1560":"close to the university is this great chai tea provider as well as great london fog options any of their hot beverages are best enjoyed during your stay because the paper cups render the beverage a paper taste the pressed wraps are quite filling however their chicken dishes are undersized there isnt enough nann bread or rice for the amount of chicken provided on my many occasions to this venue i have seen many first dates here the music can be rather intrusive however the second floor provides a decent sanctuary for studying   there isnt much light after the sun sets and you can ask the cashier behind the counter to turn them higher the chairs are usually soiled with light crumbs and some of the black seats near the window are kinda broken","1565":"fast friendly service  the omelets are huge  coffee was delicious  would definetly come back again","1584":"service parking and location was great pizza and salad had great taste it came out quick and was timed perfectly as we had to get on the road dough was okay  hard to eat with toppings falling off pizza","1589":"we went here and got the cuban sandwich it was really good the employee  i think the owner was friendly im not sure about all the other reviews on here we will be going back to try the bagels","1592":"ok decent place for pancakes and breakfast is it worth the ridiculous line that usually forms and runs out the door and around the corner no id rather go to waffle house eat drive back home get in comfy pjs and watch a game on the couch than still be there standing in line  again good food worth the money not worth the ridiculous wait go when you can walk right in and eat without a wait itll make it taste better i promise","1596":"i really do not understand the bad reviews at all this is the best burger in hendersonville they are delicious the buns are so tasty and the burgers super juicy great value for such high quality french fries and sweet potato fries are a must my husband and i have tried several of their burgers and none have disappointed id give it 5 stars but the atmosphere is a bit  boring otherwise great food and good service","1603":"that chicken sandwich damn  really great food and dessert the french macaroons are awesome and try some of the other cookies and assorted goods as well  i just shave a star off for price as it is a bit too much  otherwise cozy and efficient little shop and definitely worth a visit if you are on the go not too much seating","1609":"well the froyo trend has finally come to my own neighborhood and we couldnt be more pleased with the berry sweet incarnation its owned by the same folks who own the amazing south street flowers a few blocks down  so they are experienced at doing business in the south street corridor located a few doors down from whole foods and across from a starbucks and percy street bbq they fill in a retailing gap left by a very lackluster ritz camera and just may help draw the crowds up south street a little further   decor is bright eyepopping lime green white and orangecolored highstyle furniture make for an upbeat decor with supersized fruit photo light boards and a wall of sleek stainless yogurt soft serve dispensers you take a cardboard cup only a large available at opening but fill it with however much or little of their various enticing flavors as you like you pay by the weight just ask and they are glad to pull out tiny shot cups for you to sample flavors could use tiny wood or plastic spoons or you need a very long tongue to get the full taste of the samples they provide larger plastic teaspoons with your purchase   on our opening day visit the flavors included intense mango blueberry and the tangy original flavor also peanut butter chocolate and cappuccino were among the more flavorful offerings plus vanilla and a half dozen other flavors i cant remember between my husband and i we must have tried at least 8 flavors and loved them all chocolate and blueberry were our favorites but that may change on the next visit   after getting your cup filled with your selections of yogurt or just one flavor if youre that singleminded you move to the toppings bar where no fewer than 20 toppings can be had from small bins or tubes there were standard kidappeal sprinkles chopped up hot pink sugar wafers crumbled chocolate chip cookies and gummy candies balanced by more adult toppings of dried fruits crushed nuts fresh strawberry puree which i loved over the blueberry strawberry mango mix i enjoyed and so many more i cant even remember   there is both cafe table seating in lacy lime plastic chairs or higher counter seating along the 9th street window given the owners other business venture down the street it is no surprise there are beautiful fresh flowers throughout   as i watched each person come through the line and make their own little bit of a mess  as folks do  i also saw the staff right behind them straightening and cleaning things up so each customer gets a fresh berry sweet experience   main criticisms are few but essential they must add napkins if they were available they were completely hidden and not offered at checkout even add an easily accessible posting of nutritional information especially being near whole foods people are allergy and diet conscious and a water cooler with small cups would be a welcome addition add a recycling bin next to the trash bin for plastic spoons or use wooden spoons   best of luck to this lovely little yogurt oasis for now open til 11pm perfect","1610":"this is the best pasta house location ive been to in st louis  the service has always been good and sometimes really fun when weve had jessica wait on us and the food consistent and delicious  i dont expect fancy or special event food when i go you can go to several nice places on the hill for that but i always enjoy my meal here and that it is a good value  promotions like 299 cheese garlic bread are offered and ive never been turned down for special requests like extra meat sauce in a togo box  id recommend the chicken flamingo  ive had one incident where the food had an issue and the server quickly and in a friendly way made it right  the manager also made the effort to come over to follow up and talk with us  overall cant go wrong with good service enjoyable food that they stand behind and good value","1611":"the sushi is always fresh service is great and the prices are the best in town although i have to say the rusans in charlotte nc is step up and prices are better","1615":"dranks strong my boyfriend doesnt drink but im kind of an alcoholic and i had one of their texas 16 oz margaritas and i was feeling right and my bf was legit eyes glazed over drunk their shrimp tacos were ok shrimp was cooked and seasoned well but they literally just throw them on two flour or corn quesadillas and there you go three shrimp tacos i asked for lettuce on the side to add to it the guacamole is not fresh but ok salsa is thick and chips were decent service was good and usually i look for a spot to make stronger margaritas but holy damn these knocked us both on our ass oh 4 stars bc there were fruit flies and reg flies once the food came out otherwise it was legit","1620":"quaint and inviting  this is a beer lovers tasting room  a wide variety  of delicious beers to drink and enjoy  this is a happy addition to this amazing neighborhood","1621":"love the building itself and all the fab art on the walls one of the things that makes eagle unique very fun place to grab coffee with a friend i pass on the food though because its really not great","1622":"fantastic restaurant concept good cheap food fast fresh better than average ingredients indie background music no complaints  this type of pizza is better when consumed immediately take out degrades rapidly","1623":"with winter weather in full effect a good cup of tea really soothes the body and mind  im usually a coffee guy but every once in a while you go to work feeling sick but not deathly ill so you know you should still go to work go here  their potent brews will dull the searing pain in your throat and keep the snot at bay  their wide selection of teas and tearelated beverages can make your head spin so ask the pros behind the counter or you can just reference the clever names for guidance  free wifi and a healthy selection of books typically very quiet as well","1627":"the place is cute and the staff was very friendly nice menu good for brunch we had lunch and were seated right away i really enjoyed the avocado  toast and side of bacon nice to have another brunch place nearby","1633":"we went to kanella on a sunday night not knowing that sundays are special  they do the mezechefs tasting no other options  35 for meat and 30 for vegetarian options  between two of us we split one of each so we could try everything  we did not regret it  the meze is basically a tapasstyle meal  where they serve about 56 tapas per order  by the end of the night we couldnt even keep track of what we had eaten  everything was flavorful the right mixture of rich for certain dishes and light for more vegetarian options  we tried octopus lamb chicken bison just the range was very impressive  and we loved that they served most richer dishes on a bed of salad or something else complimentary to the tastebuds   sitting behind us was a group of regulars who come every sunday which we noticed right away and took it as a good sign    service was great  servers were attentive and sat us right away at a table outside even though we had no reservations and had no idea they had a chefs tasting that night  they just kept coming out with more and more food so if you come be prepared to be stuffed   cant wait to go back for dessert maybe skip the actual meal next time and for their famous brunch another time but for now i can only highly recommend kanella for dinner","1639":"my friend and i stumbled on this place last night awesome find great beers and atmosphere  bartender was great we did not eat but food looked great we will definitely go back","1643":"we came here on our bus tour stop on magazine street the food was really good we had sliders chicken sandwich the best and a sugar donut which was sweet the atmosphere was nice not too loud or crowded and the music playing was really good its a nice place to stop by even just for a quick bite the staff was also very friendly and helpful","1645":"found out about slices a few weeks ago and it is now my go to latenight pizza spot cheap quality slices i think i got 4 for 9 open till 3 am friday and saturday which is always a plus","1646":"i went here with a friend of mine for a delightful midmorning  afternoon treat  we browsed the farmers market and found some amazing honey salsa meats and more  then we ended up eating in the kitchen and it was delicious  followed by lunch we went to the store and bought some macaroons  which was my first time to have these delicacies and they were out of this world  overall we had a lovely time","1652":"a little place to grab a quick slice and for 125 you cant beat it fast convenient and cheap plus the pizza is actually good the owner is an old school italian kinda guy and i had the joy of shooting the shit with him while he heated the slice up in this day and age these kind of places are far and beyond getting harder to find but look past the low key interior the rough edges on the place just remember 125 a slice","1658":"this is our goto bagel place in st pete the bagels are always fresh and delicious and my bar is set pretty high as i grew up in ny with an abundance of great bagel spots i would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a great bagel why would you go to a chain place when you could support locals and the product is infinitely better the only improvement could be in selection i would love to see some whole wheat everything bagels or multigrain styles  they also sell doughnuts which are good very good and fresh but not great then again i have been to doughnut plant nyc which was basically lifechanging so again bar set high but its a nice bonus when im picking up bagels to bring home a treat if youre into really soft light yeasty doughnuts you will like these husband enjoyed the red velvet cake doughnut","1666":"great beers and good atmosphere  this was my first time in i finally made it  loved it  i want to go back and try more beers","1668":"when i would frequent spice corner i was in college broke and not into cooking at all unless cooking frozen foods counts the only reason id go is to get loose teas at a reasonable price i now regret not living closer because ive developed a taste for coffee and cooking and spice corner serves the cook and coffee drinker with their diverse selection of spices and many flavored coffee beans the only downside of this place is that its quite small and its difficult to maneuver around in its all worth it in the end though your taste buds will thank you for visiting","1671":"how nice to find a hidden gem in the restaurant desert of norristown i had delicious well made shrimp and grits with a side of tasty greens my lovely partner had huge fried shrimp with coleslaw and mac and cheese the staff was attentive and friendly we went on a saturday night and there was a great live jazz trio we had some difficulty finding the spot my only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars we will be back for sure","1674":"went on a tuesday night for a couple of drinks its the perfect relax chill place to have some beers over nice conversation they are pretty laid back and you can sit either inside or outside by their porch which sometimes can be super crowded i will definitely be back","1679":"great food lots of gluten free options great wine selection and wonderful cocktails service lacks speed but is friendly hence go when you are not in a rush make reservation for prime time dining the place fills up","1685":"eat here on tuesday the special is phenomenal call and order a large plain for pickup starting at 6pm you will be charged the same amount as the time you called call in at 630pm you get a large plain pizza for 630 hard to beat pizza is quite good","1687":"this was a fun and best of all free thing to do while in tampa while some may be blaise about the tour ive never been to a brewery tour before and it was interesting though i was disappointed because they were not in production it was a friday but apparently theyd made enough beer for the week so most people were in furlough i guess if you really want to see things in action you may want to call first just to make sure that its a production day the tour guide was really nice well spoken and while in the lab we were lucky enough to run into the brew master he was very nice and took the time to answer our questions even from that one guy who always has to ask repetitive dumb questions of course the free beer tasting at the end was great as well especially since i got to try brews that arent even for sale where i live in ny such as lord chesterfield ale and the black and tan it was actually one girls 21st bday that day so we all sang her happy birthday while sipping our beers fun but please no flip flops","1688":"moving back to tampa from baltimore ive been looking for a divey neighborhood bar that i can go to and drink and while the indie doesnt meet everything i would of hoped its the best bar ive found around  large rotating craft beer selection with and even superior bar staff thats friendly knowledgeable and locals themselves youll quickly come to realize why this is my tampa go to bar  before moving to seminole heights i was living in temple terrace and didnt mind driving here just for a beer because of the atmosphere the people and the food    cool people ranging from hipstersbusiness professionals check beer check double check since they offer a great craft selection atmosphere with a great outdoor patio where the neighborhood meets check food which is not your typical low quality bar food while not a requirement for me has come in handy on the nights i end up spending 3 hrs here lost in conversation check    overall its my favorite bar in tampa  alas its not anything like what i long for which is a divey bar like mt royal tavern in baltimore it certainly has picked up the gauntlet of being my go to everyday bar since ive moved  love it or hate it i dont care the staff here will keep making me broker for many moons to come","1696":"very good seafoodvery freshate here three times on two different visits to sb there is a wait for tables but who cares the view is great ","1699":"i ordered a caramel macchiato and absolutely loved it this was way better than starbucks coffee i liked their wrinkle fries their sandwich was good and flavorful and owner was very friendly my husband and i both ordered a panini i only wish i would find a menu online somewhere they are a little hidden gem so they should do their best to reach more people","1708":"ok so this was my first vegan meal and it did not disappoint i ordered the chipotle chicken wrap with cabbage and sweet potato fries with siraracha aioli which was delicious   the location itself is a quaint spot located in university city and the staff was very pleasant  they had delicious looking desserts which i did not partake in but i look forward to to trying some my next time back","1711":"so this was the last stop after a night out with kate b and stewart p  we decided to stop in here for late night drinksdessert after visiting shady jacks and the third degree glass factorys third friday night special event    it was a little tricky to find and i may or may not have ran a stop sign or two as i looked for it  oopsies   we finally made it inside after my scary driving  the place is so stinkin cute  i love the decorations the old decor and the little booths with the radio thing    the menu is slightly overwhelming if youre looking for a delicious alcoholic icecream martini because everything looks so gosh darn good  after debating for what felt like an hour i finally settled on the thin mint martini and boy was it good  a tad strong but yumtastic in my mouth    stewart got the chocolate covered almond which also tasted fabulous and the orange dreamsicle which i didnt care for  then again i dont like orange dreamsicles and this tasted just like one haha  kate got the great mississippi mudslide which was amazing as well and the love potion 9  the love potion one tasted interesting  kinda like a liquid pbj in your mouth which is an odd sensation but exactly what they were going for  id definitely come back and visit again with friends since it was a cute little place and id love to try the others i was debating on     funny thing though  i was totally the only one carded of course i do look like im 15 so what can ya expect i thought it was funny  side note the bathrooms are small and cramped with weird doors  not a fan","1714":"we were there for a group birthday  as well and it was wonderful our servers were very attentive no one in our group left hungry grab your favorite bottle and enjoy a good meal at this little gem","1716":"first time having sugar cream pie very good if you love sweet stuff wide variety of flavors but the staff could have been a bit more helpfulfriendly for it being our first time in the shop","1717":"great coffee at a great price  but few of food items are a lil pricey like 3 for doughnut overall im happy i found this place ","1721":"great burgers very good value for your money family friendly good service pretty clean will be returning","1727":"i think i got really lucky on this trip to st louis to stumble on lots of really awesome places that i didnt even research before i got there  a friend i met at the library conference on the last day right before we were about to head to the airport said hey have you guys tried the range yet   hooray for her  i like burgers and fries as much as the next person but generally i dont find them a super exciting food  i would come back here to try more  everything is home made the sriracha  the pickles  the buns and reaaaally tasty  the burger patty was flavorful and tasted like something my mom would make and i got a fried macaroni and cheese patty on top of my burger  yes a fried mac and cheese patty on my burger    i also love the gigantic list of soda from all around the world i got black cherry cream soda and i wish i had been hungry enough to check out some of the homemade ice cream shakes  yummm   the atmosphere is cool too with lots of random quirky decorations painted milk jugs hanging from the ceiling windows hung in a gigantic mosaic between the dining room and the kitchen and more  the only thing that made me lower this from a five to a four star rating was that they were suuuper under staffed and things were kinda slow  the server was really sweet about it and great but it did take us forever to get our food and we were huuungry","1729":"this is really great pizza the hawaiian pizza has fresh pineapple not from a can they will make pizza slices with what you want but they dont really want to compared to what is in the area this one is the best pizza","1731":"i love natural cafe delicious and fresh food and you can get anything from salads to pasta to salmon rice and veggies i also love the environment and the little flowers they have on every table ive had a few subpar interactions with the employees there but nothing to stop me from coming back","1733":"pretty straight forward   chicken fingers fries cole slaw and some texas toast its simple and good   the sauce definitely makes it remember to get some sweet tea to wash it down","1734":"i went here on a date with my girl friend and we decided to eat outside  it was beautiful  but cold so i wish they had put the heaters on  other than that it was very good  my salad was perfect and i would definitely get the chicken parmigiana again  my girlfriend had some sort of seafood medley pasta on special which was excellent  i forget what the dessert was called but it was like a creme puff filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with cocolate i would reccomend that  i will go back","1735":"went for breakfast on a sunday morning we were the first or second table in that morning small place with the chefowner and his kitchen located front and center of the dining room i ordered the eggs benedict with house made canadian bacon the bacon was good but it was the perfectly poached eggs and delicious lightly lemony hollandaise sauce that made the dish it was sublime my gf had eggsbacon and home fries which she was quite happy with the server was quite good too ill be back","1739":"delicious ice cream some other food to choose from service a bit slow but ice cream out of this world","1741":"good times and great crowds at grand opening over memorial day weekend  another good addition to the local craft beer scene  current beer selections include a wheat stout ipa and seasonal ipa  and the beers are slightly stronger ranging from 60 to 73 abv  the ambiance of the taproom is very nice with wooden interior and large garage doors to give it an airy feel  there is also a good view on the inside of the fermenters in which the beers are brewed  one other note on the taproom are the artwork  the artwork are some of the same as the ones shown on first fridays  think the aim is to use the space to display works from local artists  i only tried the stout during my visit during grand opening and it had a good flavor w coffee undertones  hope to make it back to try out the other brews as well as finding out about new styles that might be coming out","1747":"the setting is very interesting and reminded me of a mexican restaurant bar area music and ambiance however the food really does justice and there were plenty to choose from i was craving for dinuguan and although it was cooked well i was expecting the traditional sour taste the bicol express was both sweet and spicy which was a good combination if you are craving for filipino food this place will suffice","1749":"this place used to be much worse but the food has gotten better and the place renovated so the atmosphere is better","1760":"its memorial day what better food than a burger were out of town and didnt know what was available other than the typical fast food joints and five guys we narrowed our search to burger up and cheeseburger charleys we settled on burger up and boy am i glad  im a fairly picky eater and hamburgers are one of my favorite foods unfortunately all too many places really messup a hamburger five guys included we read some reviews here on yelp and still couldnt be certain we were making the right decision someone complained about family style seating sitting with strangers and another mentioned a dorkedup pbj  first let me say that the decor was quite unique there were only a few tables where you risk sitting with strangers and im certain you could tell the hostess that wouldnt be preferable honestly though lifes short chillout and make the best of it are you really that unsociable the menu plainly states that its grilled whos ever eaten a grilled pbj if thats not what youre looking for dont order it  finally for the burgers  i ordered the classic burger with white cheddar cheese and was completely satisfied someone complained that it was dry you must have gone on an off night because our burgers were juicy and quite tasty the server told us that we could opt for heinz ketchup if we didnt like their house ketchup but who wouldnt like their house ketchup good stuff you also have a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries we didnt get regular fries but their sweet potato fries were great too  okay so no restaurant is perfect our server daniel was great ambiance and food was great the sweat tea was not good nor was the lemonade  there you have it what they are known for  burgers  were definitely worth it i think someone complained about the cost we spent 3500 for two but where do you not spend that much for two including a tip  well definitely be back","1761":"beautiful desserts and a beautiful atmosphere i love the rushing of the tourists and the beautiful lighting in the bakery     the desserts are the kind that make children press their noses to the glass i had my first cannoli here and loved it you must try this place","1765":"wawa has pretty much everything you could want especially at 3 in the morning such a convenient location especially if you live in the quad and the fact that they are open 247 is a lifesaver from the thrill of using the touch screen to place your order to the freal shakes wawa is just the best place to get everything you need","1768":"just because its vegan doesnt mean its healthy reported a friend of a friend and i think hes totally rightin a good way  on one of the first chilly days of fall i was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch i wanted something warm and indulgentand just vegan and ecofriendly enough for me to bask in a little firstworld smug  so i got the crispy chickn sandwich and sweet potato fries both of these items really just hit the spot  if youre looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from and honestly other places to go in the city however if youre looking to fill a chikfila sandwich sized hole in your soulthis may be for you  some notes sandwich is very goodbun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing but these things are easily amended  friesgreatand this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away yes in the cold what makes it better are the sauces siracha aoli yum and black bean cilantro yum  overall service was really personable and decor was lovely yes it is a little pricey but most vegan options tend to beand yes it relies heavily on faux meats but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul","1776":"we boughtrented some kegs from bevmo for our wedding and overall our experience was good  we decided to go with bevmo because of their selection and prices  we ordered two 7 gallon kegs of local beer oak creek and when we went to pick them up one of them was labeled wrong which caused a lot of distress because we didnt realize it until wed gotten to our venue an hour and a half away  however once it was tapped we realized it was the correct beer  we also rented taps and tubs to keep the kegs cold it was nice to be able to get all of those items in one place and have people help us load it in our truck  after our wedding we returned the items and the deposit was refunded on our card in a heartbeat  easy and fast wed totally do it again","1777":"great snacks and awesome beer amazing random music selection outside patio is a plus","1780":"laurel liquor is my go to for alcohol i have a mobile bartending service business pour it up and i can rely on laurel liquors to have whatever i need at a reasonable price for all of my specialty cocktails wwwpouritupmobilecom","1782":"ready for some unique meat burgers  from bison to elk bareburger has you covered not to be left out they also boast a nice selection for vegetarians  while here on a visit i had the el matador  a bison burger with queso fresco pickled jalapenos guacomole green leaf and pico de gallo on a brioche bun   can you say mouth party  between the juiciness of the bison burger and the snap of the jalapenos  pico de gallo i was delighted   in addition to my burger i noshed on the spicy pickles and fries with an assortment of dips   if i ever find myself in the area again i will not hesitate to make stop","1784":"went here as a last resort and was pleasantly surprised its fairly dark inside but is cozy and would be good in the winter i ordered the french dip and i was so hungry i gobbled it down it was good probably not the best ive had but good and the clam chowder is really good even the waitress was saying people from the east coast comment on how good it is in the midwest the waitress was great and attentive and personable and we didnt have to wait too long","1785":"every time i stop by an italian restaurant i forget theyre there to feed the starving family in you my gosh my meal was never ending alfredo sauce was pretty good standard to what i expect my white sauce to be  rich and creamy i also ordered a side of the meatball because it seems to be their specialty cooked through without being too tough the meat tasted well seasoned without overpowering and despite the clashing sauce was pretty good to eat together blasphemous maybe but i enjoyed it i will stop by for a meal next time im in stl","1789":"excellent tender delicious bbq the potato salad was creamy and the potatoes had the perfect consistency the beans were sweet and tangy soooo good the staff was really friendly and kind and all of our food took minutes to receive ","1807":"this chef only buys fried chicken from this place my only soul food spot good  consistant always call ahead","1810":"im a huge panara fan  i just dont like coming in here around 5pm  traffic on street rd is terrible","1811":"i have found my onestop for all breakfasts happiness destination ill run here if ever a zombie apocalypse threatens to take away my morning food youll find bagels donuts and mmmmmm youll find coffee ill ignore the sandwiches for now  food with a word like bagel in the title i expected the bagels to blow me away with around 20 types of bagels they are delicious to eat without additions or toasting but dont expect to substitute your new york plane tickets for these im a donut fan and these are a hit or miss if it has thick frosting the frosting breaks apart from the donut in chunks noooo but if the frosting has been glazed on it was done so with love and partly melts into the donut dough which makes it delicious   ah coffeealthough some types are served a bit small for the pricemmmmmmm awesome many choices it complements the doughness of the food and comes in many forms a side area allows for selfservice   service the employees run the place like a corporate business serious brisk unsmiling the quick service is awesome as well as the acknowledgement upon entry but it doesnt seem like these guys get buddybuddy with anybody im assuming they have cult fansive seen all types of people go here alllll freakin types thats a good thing  location appearance the store blends into the notsopretty plazas of st petes 4th street worn out signs outside dusty parking lot stark contrast from the comfiness that seems to radiate nuclear energy from inside cool at the side you can watch a baker creating the pastries for the store","1821":"never thought id decide to review a mc donalds but they are always so nice here always friendly and they move quickly even when the line is long i dont go to mc donalds that frequently but i choose this one whenever i want something quick i work close by or for like a cheat meal side note is it a cheat meal if you do it often","1822":"so they enticed me w a coupon for a free sub w drink purchase heard about how they steamed their meats so lets go ahead and try it  have to admit first impression wasnt great when i walked back to the car i noticed there was water dripping from the bag that must have come from the steaming of the meat luckily i caught it before i made a mess of myself  i ordered the firehouse hero roast beefturkeyham which was one of the specialty subs there was a substantial amount of meat and the sub roll wasnt soggy like i expected to be if you are hungry get a sub at firehouse i was feeling lethargic after finishing the sandwich  also interesting was the coke freestyle machine they used to serve soft drinks you can choose from 100 selections i always get bored w the standard fountain drinks so the freestyle machine worked great ended up getting a diet vanilla root beer  final verdict steaming of the meats did bring out more flavor and it didnt make a mess of the sub and i might go back just to get a special soft drink","1826":"updating my review as our last two visits here have been much improved im not sure if they have new management but whatever theyre doing makes this a viable fastfood stop for bellevue the service is friendly and fast and orders have been correct  fresh for fast food   management keep up the good work as its noticed and appreciated","1828":"i truly enjoyed this spot i hate chain restaurants especially for breakfast i am a pancake girl and this place hit the spot the type of flour utilized is top notch and the creme syrup was an excellent addition it was such a kerfuffle trying to get a seat and i felt rudely looked over at times but ill know how to navigate it next time","1831":"got the vegan bowl and my sister got the vegan burrito with siracha cauliflower in itthe best tasting cauliflower by the way  we also got the loaded vegan fries overall the second best vegan meal will be back soon","1833":"pretty sure that in a previous life i was daisy buchanan its the only explanation for my unreasonable passions for art deco and gin every time i go to the fountain on locust im transported back into that previous life i mean  a former stutz showroom the booths the deco light fixtures the murals on the walls the tile floor and the cocktails  this place could be a gimmicky touristtrapy kind of place but its not the food  desserts and cocktails would hold their own in plainer setting and the servers are friendly and efficient i love this place","1834":"we ate here as a walk in birthday celebration dinner on a busy saturday night the host was very accommodating and found us a table quickly  the service was great and the food was fabulous  this is a great local place with a wonderfully cozy atmosphere we live in a town with few really good food options so this is a great option if u are looking to stay close but have a great meal the location on the river is beautiful too would be great if there was a real outdoor seating option","1838":"visiting from los angeles some friends recommended district donuts for their creative donuts specifically their vietnamese iced coffee donut and their sliders i have to say im not as impressed as i thought i would be   walking into district donuts you get a very clean and nice hipster vibe their extra fancy donuts are on display by the cashier theyre very nicely decorated and look delicious  we ordered the pork belly sliders vietnamese iced coffee donut brown butter donut coffee chocolate milk and an espresso shot the caffeine was nothing to write home about but the chocolate milk was very good  just sweet enough  the pork belly slider in my opinion wasnt very good it needed more daikon radish and the cut of pork belly wasnt fatty enough  the donuts are very sweet almost too sweet the vietnamese coffee donut didnt have enough coffee flavor to it i felt like it didnt really capture the essence of what it purported to be","1843":"i used to live a few doors down from las cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is delicious i dont know if they still make it but the chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things ive ever eaten  my husband and i visited last sunday for brunch and we ordered a ton of food because we had a 50 gift certificate to use up i can highly reccommend the huevos divorciados and the omlette poblano i am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way my husband had the divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty  my favorite at las cazuelas are the tacos the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and i confess i have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them we tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming you could not taste the yummy meaty grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos my husband loved the shredded pork tacos and i thought they were ok the shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh crisp and light i suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again i will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future as always the cafe de olla coffee with cinnamon  and desserts are very good i tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town keep up the great work","1852":"overall i thought it was a great experience service was a bit slow but the bartenders were doing a good job burgers were tasty and fresh i would definitely recommend this place to try i would go back for sure the next time i am in the stl","1853":"delicious coffee and espresso drinks and a cute little cafe if you come during the morning rush hour be prepared to wait a while for your drink there are a decent number of seats here but again if you come in the morning you might feel a little uncomfortable with the people in line crowding your space i am a big coffee drinker so i like that their refills are 75 cents if i remember correctly the baristas are also very friendly  my major problem with la columbe is their lack of wifi its the 21st century guys its a good place to hang out for a few hours with a friend or do some noncomputerrequiring work but the lack of wifi is seriously limiting","1859":"i did not expect this random taiwanese restaurant outside of circus circus was actually really good for americantaiwanese food standard get the braided pork bowl and rolled pancakes","1860":"i stopped in henrys for coffee with friends on a sunday afternoon i didnt try any of their food but the coffee was good the atmosphere was nice and miraculously it wasnt packed on a rainy day one thing that seemed odd for a coffee shopthe acoustics werent great lots of echoes from kitchen other customers music etc throw down some rugs and this would be a nice spot to catch up over coffee or get some work done","1862":"i really enjoyed going to hollygrove it was fun for my family to pick out the vegetables for our box what i really love is that we had a lot of items in our box that we wouldnt necessarily pick out at the grocery store which lead to creating some delicious and healthy meals the one thing i didnt like was that some of the food was on its last legs when we cut into it which meant half went into the garbage i have to make it clear that we cut into it the day we picked up the box anyhow i cannot wait to go back","1867":"went on a monday and stood in line for an hour service was good and the host was amazing that man should totally get a raise overall food was good but not worth the wait for that long i guess i was expecting amazing pancakes but they were just some good old fashion pancakes but i guess its just one of those nashville traditions you have to try once","1872":"claudios fresh mozzarella tastes like biting into a cold glass of milk without the dangerous glasseating part cause dont try that   im telling you that its so delicious so freshy i love their ricotta too   actually i usually go in for just those two items but end up leaving with multiple bags full of way more cheeses than any two people should have on hand at one time and olives and beautiful dried pastasand any number of selections from the deli counter that taunt me as i wait in line salumi speaks to me","1878":"hidden in the northeast side of the city market  caf\u00e9 olivia is a must try  solid sandwiches fairly priced and quick service  the godfather sandwich is a must try so much talian meat and veggies you can hear the bread  and amazing bread it is crying for help check this place out","1880":"free booze even though its budweiser i wish guiness made a tour of their plant i would buy a house across the street they have tours throughout the day and its every 10 minutes first you check out the clysdales really huge horses and they have one that it a monster of a horse the top of his back is like 7 feet so you know how big the rest of him is  next is where they hold the beers one container can hold 3700 barrels which they said it would equal 1 beer an hour for the next 137 years of your life crap thats alot of beers they have 65 containers in this room they take you to the next stop where they break down all of the ingredients and heat it up it sucks because this room is fricken hot and with the missouri heat its even hotter  they finally show you where they bottle the beers it totally looks like laverne n shirley pretty cool and they bottle like a zillion in a minute now its finally the best part of the tour free beer its so frsh not the kind you get at the store  lots of parking great store to buy stuff and really cool staff all college kids so they make it fun","1886":"i usually drop by here after a workout at maryland farms ymca  its your typical chipotle service is alway great and food is always fresh  also they are not stingy with the meat like some other chipotles  not to sound like a meathead but nothing is worse than getting a half ass scoop of meat at chipotle","1887":"this place has the most amazing chicken donairs in the city seriously amazing the issue is that they only seem to have them available about 60 of the times i go in and since its the only reason i go im often disappointed frustrating and sad because i really do love their food","1889":"really great food love that it was a great spot for a family to eat breakfast banana pancakes and boudin omelet were really good","1895":"i really like this place and have had great talks with the owner  one thing ive found is that the female baristas arent very friendly to me and i think im a pretty friendly guy  today 72911 in particular was a bit annoying i frequently order icedtea here and love that i get a free refill  i was not aware that there was a charge for a refill on icedcoffee  the baristas were rude to me and i felt like an imbecile after my interaction  id appreciate the following  1 before pouring me a refill it would have been nice to let me know it aint free 2 if i express surprise at their being a charge please dont tell me i dont have to have it  3 if i choose to have it because i dont want it to go to waste please dont tell me its not very good iced coffee if its not good why the hell should i have to pay for a refill when i dont have to pay for a refill of the icedtea that is delicious","1898":"good beer and food plenty of options right off the beach prices are plans have nice outside seating may need to hire some hotter girls to work here","1899":"great grocery for for everyday items  usually no wait for check out  fast counter should be more ready for items out of stock or need more prep time i have waited more than most would for items that need to be made due to being sold out clean  friendly staff   left publix for this 1 location on grocery store   now has a tesla charging station","1902":"great place to take the family i hope noboru can keep up this quality level for the longterm because we love it here","1904":"really yummy donuts  i loved going in there  the ladies at the counter were great","1912":"this restaurant is absolutely delicious their  parfait is yummyits a pretty decent size and its actually filling by its self their french toast is amazing to top it off the mimosa was perfect","1914":"i never waited longer than 10 mins for pho but dam it was worth the wait ive been to so many pho restaurants but the broth on this pho was amazing the proportion was good too the vietnamese sandwiches were good but if you dont state what you want on it theyll put everything on itincluding peppers the boba tea was good and the service was decent the ambiance and decor of this place is legit the only issue witht his place is that its pretty small and parking kinda sucks and your food may take long to receive after ordering but like i said the pho was bombcom found my new pho spot in the area","1918":"stumbled on this while walking mass ave to the hotel site seeing had a cup of coffee and a veggie egg  cheese breakfast sandwich on toast loved it  they have a great selection of sandwiches and drinks","1919":"great little spot for having done local beers its a bit small not some place id go extremely often but good to mark off the list nothing super unique but they know what they are and they do it well very nice staff","1926":"food is always great this is one of my regular weekly lunch spots drive thru depends on the day as to quickness it usually goes fast today super quick got the half sandwich and cup of soup delicious the turkey avacodo blt  chicken and rice soup  and a sweet tea im set ","1928":"i really enjoy the food here  pros 1 lots of seating and spacious  youre never scrunched up against other people 2 outdoor seating 3 food is fabulous 4 tons of variety of food and drinks eg more than 15 varieties of hot tea four varieties of iced tea 5 discounts if you bring in your own cup as well as a punch card to earn free stuff 6 free wifi 7 seasonal foods as well  including a great blueberry season omg 8 clean and well stocked 9 lots of parking  always able to find a spot and right next to a fedex 10 locallyfamily owned  gotta love and support that  cons 1 with so much seating they need to invest in some sound dampening materials  it is so loud when there are many people there  and when there arent  you feel like other people can hear you  i never feel like that at bread co  busy or not 2 the prices are a little high  not a lot  just a little too high  thats it  i love going to the daily bread  i love how lovely they staff are  theyre very helpful and patient  i try to meet with people here as often as possible  my kids love it and we have never had a bad menu item","1936":"owc is a super cute quaint little coffee shop with great coffee and modern decor great find for day one reno","1939":"i think the coffee is great and the food is yummy the iced coffee is delicious and i also enjoy their homemade syrups caramel is awesome my fav snack they have their is the avocado toast with a poached egg on top so good i find their coffee and food can be a bit expensive but the quality is good so i dont want to complain too much since buddy brew is such a tampa institution the shop can get kind of crowded which is what demotes it to 4 stars for me im glad their business is doing well but i like a quieter coffee shop vibe   definitely a place to stop by if you havent been before","1944":"we came for a sunday brunch and the place is amazing we wanted to get a tour of the distillery usually if the brewster is there they would totally do it but because it was his day off and the restaurant was busy we didnt get a chance to do the tour however the manager was extremely kind he offered to tour us when rush hour is over we just couldnt really wait around you can peak at the distiller through the bar though  really like their drinkware  i had the bone marrow plate and it was very good came with crispy toast other snack that looked interesting including the duck plate  the brunch menu wasnt too interesting but overall the food quality is good  nice beer and cocktail menu","1949":"tried it for the first time today only a few blocks from my house and i had no clue this delicious place existed service was great and the food didnt taste greasy at all i wish their vegetarian selection was a little more varied but their veggie omelette the california sammich and house potatoes were yum they make their bread and pastries in house","1951":"surprising good bagels from this unassuming shop on the north end of lambertville  very friendly owner  decent coffee   definitely a keeper","1957":"we decided to take an alternate route back from cochon butcher to our hotel and stumbled across this small confectioner  i had a few spare microns of space in my stomach for something sweet so we grabbed a filled lemon and a chocolate cupcake  the filled lemon was the better of the two  both were fresh delicious and hit the spot  i wish wed sampled some of the truffles but just didnt have room","1958":"i must say i didnt really have anything to eat the bf had a little cup of chocolate chip ice cream and said it was good but really how bad can chocolate chip ice cream be   4 stars just because of the huge oldfashioned comfy chairs we sat on and almost fell asleep in for 30 min we sat right by the window and got to people watch on a rainy afternoon","1959":"chefs market has a great variety of food  its convenient to where i live so we eat here on a regular basis  everything ive had here has been excellent  if you dont see anything you like in the case they have a great cheeseburger as well   the deserts are great too  their german chocolate cake is the best ive ever had","1961":"love love love the studio but parking has turned into such a headacheunless you get there extremely early and at the right moment from a previous class letting out then maybe you can get a spot  with the new distillery below the already small parking lot is splitcausing for some not so woosahhh moments trying to get to class  case in point due to 500pm traffic for a 530pm class and the parking issue i was 15 minutes late for class and didnt want to be rude to other students or the instructor interrupting class i missed my class","1965":"i was shopping at winco long before i moved to reno 3 years ago as far as im concerned its the only supermarket chain in town  like one other reviewer said i do stop at trader joes  when i go do a major shopping trip because of their somewhat different produce selections and their wonderful whole wheat bread offerings    i use a lot of nuts to try to stay healthy and i love the bulk department for those because i can buy them in large or small quantities at a low price i also use many other products from this department whole wheat pasta dry beans and veggies chips and the wonderful no sugar chocolates  it was interesting when the store recently opened a fresh sushi bar i like many others was very happy to see it   i dinged them one star because of the fact that if you are there at a busy evening you might find little kids running up and down the isles and playing nerf football in the open areas  parents from this part of town who are doing their shopping should keep their children with them and under control  i actually prefer shopping at winco south as that problem does not seem to exist there","1967":"although i love the coffee the parking situation makes me drive elsewhere they have some great unique coffee choices and they bedazzle your frothy milk with hearts  whats not to love about that service is always great and the atmosphere has good vibes    delicious breakfast options and the smell of coffee in the air will put any coffee drinker in a great mood  not much seating available since the place is always packed hopefully the hyde park village location will be a bit better but again these places arent meant for a quick coffee grab  on most my days i dont have time to park a car walk minutes away wait in line wait for coffee and then truck back to car same as if its rainy outside if your in a rush you will just have to hit up a drive thru","1970":"met friends there for brunch on a sunday boer fact day to chill on their expansive patio with some refreshing margaritas  staff was friendly and professional  the atmosphere has a nice cool vibe to it  definitely a great addition to the tampa food scene for an upscale mexican restaurant   table side guacamole was well prepared and came paired up with gluten free tortilla chips  the added hot sauce was hot  i eat a lot of spice but this definitely brings the kick   food was generally good not outstanding but tasty and fresh i had the carne asada  tacos  definitely would revisit","1971":"desserts and ambience crowds vary by the time and day you go but quiet or crowded its an interesting bistro type place you cant miss with this spot as a date night locale  always delicious and cozy the menu has changed very little over time and its not overly extensive but they often have a new special dessert or special of the day be warned as their favorites do run out so the later in the day you go items may not be available their carrot cake is pretty good moist and not too sweet located close to local schools and webster university this is often a place to go to escape those regular establishments asianladylikes","1972":"this is authentic chinese  at first i was taken aback when the hostess tried successfully to talk me out of american chinese dishes and try something more authentic  that was my first experience with cumin lamb  wow  my only complaint is that the spiciness varies widely every time i get it  must be different chefs all the time","1976":"i went to so many chinese restaurants  but never likes the food but here for the first time i truly enjoyed myself at this place best chinese food ever i loved it  i will always recommend han dynasty  very slow service but tasty when finally arrived","1978":"excellent standard mexican restaurant fare at reasonable prices we had two entrees an appetizer and a huge mug of beer each and the bill was just over 30 nicely remodeled seating area especially compared to the rundown look of the previous occupant hacienda","1979":"we arrived a bit later and were seated outside right away the waitress recommended the local lobster and it was delicious great atmosphere looking out over the water","1982":"one of my favorite spots for coffee and donuts in nola parking space available if youre driving  very friendly staff quick service  one caveat the backyard space is a great addition but they keep the trash close to that area and it smells really really bad  otherwise i would have given a 5 star review","1987":"i definitely check the bathroom to rate the cleanliness of a restaurant and of all the pho places ive been to this has been the most clean thus far quiet well decorated  friendly staff that im not accustomed to from the pho places in san francisco this restaurant surely deserves the rate that it has","1996":"fresh grouper is amazing here prepared anyway you want it  family tried 5 different meals and they were all great came on a sunday night and the wait time was awful took at least an hour to get a table but it was the day before memorial day  would definitely come back again though","1999":"we headed here for lunch on a sunday afternoon and i think it is going to be one of our new favorite lunch spots  its not as big of a place as i had imagined it would be but the setup was cozy and not too cramped  we were greeted and seated right away with drinks soon to follow  our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu   i ordered a u pick 2 soup and sandwich  dill pickle potato soup which was exactly like it soundsdelicious  and the blackhawk sandwich came on a soft fluffy vienna roll with rare roast beef roasted red pepper lettuce tomato and a goat cheese spread  i could have used a touch more of the goat cheese but for less than 8 it was a great lunch  oh yeahthere was a side of billy goat chips too    the reason i didnt give the fountain a 5 star rating was my dessert  i ordered the johnny rabbit monkey malt a chocolate malt blended with bananas  i am a malted freak and was  a little disappointed when it came outnot very thick and not very malty  i figured out why when i got to the bottom of the metal shaker cup and all the malt powder was stuck to the bottom of the cup  next time ill stick with a sundae  and there will be a next timesoon","2000":"i ordered the humus and falafels and was good the falafels were one point with good texture the humus was great but i would have requested less olive oil i will be going back next time im in the area","2003":"we made the journey through the cold and snow all the way out to st charles with our friends the ds to try hendricks bbq  we found a warm bustling place with a nice saturday night feel and some decent barbecue  hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect both st louis style and back ribs pulled pork brisket turkey and sausage what no goat oh well  hendricks has a seriously large menu obviously centered around barbecue but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat  we had a great waiter aaron  he was well informed  i was impressed that he actually knew the definition of st louis style spare ribs and when we each ordered a pick 2 platter he informed us that each couple could split the whole shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price so that is what we did  apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce which meats with my approval  there are four sauces on the table  each of these trays of meat comes with four sides so ms t and i had two slaws greens and sweet potato fries  the ds added cheddar grits sweet potato casserole green beans and baked beans  so here we go from first to worst  hendricks makes good ribs  both the st louis style and the back ribs were smoky moist tender and nicely seasoned with rub  the rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness  if it were overapplied it would be too sweet but it was in the proper proportion  i would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other  next for me was the pulled pork  i am not a fan of pulled pork in missouri  often it is in large hunks and dry  this was pulled to bite size and was moist but not wet  i would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs  the brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods  it had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor  it was nice and tender but was on the edge of dry  this would also make a good sandwich but might require some mayo to lube it up  i know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket  this is also worth ordering but at least this one night was not quite as good as pm in chesterfield  valley  still pretty good for missouri  turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and i would not reorder them  turkey is always a real gamble  if it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced before any juices run out it can be magnificent as we experienced at blacks barbecue in texas  this had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry  it was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible  i just would not order it again though on another night it might be fine    the sausage was hmmmm  i almost liked it  it was not like hillshire farms a point in its favor  it had some nice heat ms t and the ds found it too spicy but it is not really  i like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in texas  they can be sensational  my issue with this was that it tasted like pine sol  this is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor  is it juniper berries  a1 steak sauce kind of has the pine sol thing going maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix  whatever all i can think of is the power of pine sol baby when eating it  ill pass on that next time  sides  ms d declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can  try some at alcenias in memphis they loved the sweet potato casserole likening it to dessert  they liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans  i did not sample them  aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion    the only think aaron was not accurate on was the slaw  he thought it had no onion but that was all i could taste  this is very finely ground not shredded slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in carolina  it is unique but inedible  this was one of those rare times when we left the slaw  it is unspeakably bad  the sweet potato fries were fine  the collard greens with bacon were good  they were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat  i enjoyed them  there are even more sides to try  hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night  i think we need to meet our st charles friends the ls there  so go have some ribs maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich  you will want to bring your own slaw  im going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs","2004":"i cant speak for anything other than breakfast but ive always enjoyed that from this place i always end up getting an omelette since it comes with home fries coffee and a juice this tops most places that dont even include any of that   like others ensure they take your order correctly i once ordered a spanish omelette and ended up with a spinach omelette with feta it was still really good  so i didnt complain but it was definitely not what i ordered   the delivery guy is always nice and courteous and i have no complaints there at all i will keep coming here since i know the food and pricing includes a good amount of stuff","2009":"we got the grilled 3 cheese sandwich and the beef barley soup they were unreal the only issue was the price as good and homemade as it was i had a hard time swallowing 31 for 2 sandwiches and 2 bowls of soup just a touch too expensive if it wasnt so much i would have easily given it 5 stars   however if youre looking for a good and wholesome meal give this place a try","2010":"my parents and i were looking for a quick meal of ukrainian food and thought to check out uncle eds  i hadnt been here in years  my mothers tomato soup and ham sandwich were delicious the sauerkraut perogies and cabbage rolls were very good  dad and i are very happy  our waitress was very pleasant  the service was fast and the price is fantastic","2012":"the chicken chow mein is what the kids love the sesame chicken is light crispy and good for the whole family we took 3 kids had sesame chicken beef with broccoli chicken chow mein and steamed rice we left with 2 to go boxes so the portions are good sized the whole meal with tea and soft drinks was under 40 it was a very early dinner so it was not at all crowded we will definitely be back","2037":"this is a fantastic place to get meats and other groceries  a little on the pricey side but you getting better quality in most of the items  the only drawback to mazzaros is the parking    if you go on the weekend expect a crowd","2040":"fun stop service was subpar ordered the adult orange sundae description was mesmerizing on the menu presentation and taste a little lackluster but all of the actual food was delicious my grilled cheese add apples and turkey was divine kale salad a nice touch everyone else had great meals too pesto chicken sandwich even my daughters pbj  but this place is all about the kitsch factor keep your expectations in check and ignore the sour puss servers and youll enjoy the visit ask for one of the soap opera booths ","2045":"we had two pizzas delivered loved the flavored crust all in all very tasty  pizza crust was a bit soggy but otherwise good","2047":"they did a great job with my sons superhero cake the bakery was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful when i went to order i just showed them a couple of pictures of what i was looking for and they they came through everyone loved the taste too i will definitely order here again","2048":"surprisingly good authentic taiwanese food in reno   this place is tiny and packed with people waiting for tables if crowds or people hovering over you while dining makes you feel uncomfy this likely isnt the place for you  tables do turn pretty quickly   boba drink was meh  syrup used and not mixed be sure to shake it well before stabbing in a straw   food was great though we had beef noodle soup  a garlicbasil chicken  a beef chow fun  b pork filled pancakes  b wished the pancake was more crispy tofu and bak choi  b","2050":"fantastic greek food at reasonable prices  the lamb dishes were particularly good","2053":"a great neighborhood coffee house  the hood in question is dogtown  the java is good and draws a wide demographic from college kids to seniors to moms  not the pretty people scene that kaldis can be sometimes  very laid back and inviting  good food too","2057":"really great made to order pizza like a chipotle for pizza i had the alligator sausage with pepperoni onions mushrooms and jalape\u00f1os on mine and it was delicious great beer and smores pie too use the yelp offer for the smores pie some issues with charging for this free pie but otherwise great service too","2062":"the line can be intimidating but moves pretty fast the pancakes are the bomb i love pancakes i thought it was worth it i went on a busy saturday and my group of 5 waited in line sat down and finished our food in maybe less than 2 hours probably less than that the coffee wasnt great but lets be honest i was there for the chocolate chip pancakes","2063":"once my salad had dirt in it seriously  it was like it was plucked from the ground that very moment and didnt get a bath  oh well i ordered the koguts curry  roasted chicken melted swiss and cheddar with curried mayonnaise on russian black bread it was mighty greasy but mighty tasty too and if there was dirt in it it blended in with the bread  ive since been here for their farmer dinners where a local farmer sources the producemeatcheese and they create a special meal around the ingredients it was lovely eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and tomatoes and sauteed summer squash from biver farms  ive obviously gotten over my dirt phobia just proves the food here is farm fresh im pulling for the clean farm fresh approach though","2065":"i have been to ru sans several times over the last 6 years so my star rating is based on my overall experiences   the pros very big menu with a lot of variety i usually always order the crunchy mui bueno tuna tempura and sea bass yakitori i love the sauce that comes w the tempura and the sea bass yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth i love techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me the fried ice cream is also to die for whatever you do dont forget to order the plum sake it is served warm and it gives you the best warm fuzzy feeling ever if you drink enough lol its usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because i prefer to always feel like im at a party   the cons although the food is usually good i have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is tiny and the rolls are so huge you cant eat them in one bite and for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart ive never had anything that actually tasted bad though i have experienced waiters at times who take forever forget you and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you a few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise literrally for your birthday 5 years ago they even gave me a 25 giftcard for my birthday when i celebrated there a couple years ago i made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group when we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table   last couple of years it doesnt seem like they do much for birthdays    overall i think ru sans is a fun place with good sushi and a cool atmosphere perfect start to a night of fun","2066":"i wish there was more seating but whatre you gonna do haha  friendly staff and huge portions  so yummy love the scrambles and burritos the french toast was amazing for real too","2068":"small restaurant in the casino 4 stars because there isnt much service you order at the counter and they deliver the food to you busing of the tables were slow as well however the food we ordered was great i had the fried oyster platter and it was really good we also ordered the charbroiled oysters and they were amazing","2069":"i enjoyed grand isle so much that i came back twice during my one week stay in new orleans  highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked  very cool  trip one it was my first night in new orleans and i was starving  i went on yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that harrahs casino was right across the street  having been the harrahs in atlantic city several times more times than id like to admit i knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino  i strolled into grand isle around 7pm on a tuesday night and thankfully it wasnt busy  i took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer  the nola blonde  for an appetizer i ordered the shrimp gumbo  how touristy of me  it was really good  everything shrimp gumbo should taste like  for dinner i decided on the house made gator sausage po boy  oh my god amazing  the flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious  i knew instantly that id be getting this again before i headed back to pa  im not sure if martinis were on special that night but i saw a ton of them being ordered  the ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on so im assuming the martinis were pretty good haha  trip two two days after trip one my boyfriend arrived in new orleans and i told him i had to take him to a few great restaurants i had tried earlier in the week  we headed over to grand isle  for an appetizer we got the isle sampler of oysters  all of them were delicious but the oysters fulton with bacon cheddar and onions was my favorite  so good  for entrees i once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two  youve already read my review about the gator po boy so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada  it was delicious  asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful  i can see why this won awards  we spoke with the bartender a little bit who was a super nice guy  turns out hes from nj so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland  in short  go to grand isle  get some oysters shrimp caminada po boy the gator po boy and a lot of beer and maybe some martinis haha  you wont be disappointed","2074":"had a last minute request to find a special rye whiskey high west double rye as a present in new orleans but didnt have a car or time to travel far to find it this place had it in stock and at reasonable price very convenient location in french quarter","2075":"the husband had a hankering for asian food so we decided to check out this new thai restaurant based on the reviews we were not disappointed we started of with their pork  shrimp dumplings they looked more like shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious they have 4 spice levels mild medium hot  thai hot they are not kidding around with how spicy their food is normally i order the pad thai the first time i visit a thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier garlic beef at their medium spice level it was delicious  perfectly spicy the hubby got the panang curry chicken medium spice  it was delicious  perfectly spiced too the portion sizes were just right we finished off our meal with their sweet sticky rice with mango omg it was the best ive ever had they use the black rice  it was warm  drizzled with hot sweetened condensed milk the mango was perfectly ripe  there was more than 23 slices we will definitely go back the hubby wants to try something hot attention vegans  they have a separate menu of dishes just for you","2077":"i really liked this place  i went with a coworker during beer week  we came from their sister bar farmers cabinet  both places are quite similar but fc had an air of pretentiousness that boilermaker didnt  fc was also considerably more expensive for smaller portions whereas boilermakers beers and food were reasonablypriced  their beer week offerings featured over a dozen from their brewery cabinet artisinal brewhouse which are mainly sour andor really interesting beers  i absolutely loved everything i tried  one of the two bartenders was very knowledgeable and all were helpful  we ordered their hot dog plate which was 2 baconwrapped hot dogs with a mountain of fries for 9 which is a pretty good deal imo  unfortunately i just read that the headbrewer is leaving cabinet artisinal brewhouse  hopefully they can get another highly skilled brewer to continue pumping out unique brews especially my beloved sours as their beers were a big reason id go back to this place","2080":"we ventured over here on friday at noon and the wait was about 30 minutes luckily the line moves fast and they provide selfserve complimentary coffee outside i thought that was a nice little touch everyone here is extremely friendly our waitress came over to our table right when we were seated and made some delicious recommendations since we were starving and standing in line we already knew exactly what we wanted i ordered the raspberry delight which was basically three rolled up pancakes with raspberry powdered sugar and whipped cream wow and add that maple syrup to it everything about those pancakes was perfect it was hard to stop eating them only disappointment was the bacon it was barely crispy i feel like it is hard to mess up bacon especially at a breakfast joint but they sure did and it was definitely not worth 4 also note that you pay at the counter once youre done","2092":"did not catch our servers name but he was amazing and made the experience that much better he reccomended the scallop and shrimp entree and to get it over pasta and it was outstanding my son ordered the kids cheeseburger i was a little disappointed because the rolls they use are plain store bought potato rolls that i buy at the supermarket all the time","2095":"this place is decent for some quick fresh tacos i tried the sauteed shrimp tacos and they were okay they needed to be seasoned but otherwise it was good overall i would visit this store again","2099":"finally a place in new hope with unique high quality food i expected everything to be spicy as is my experience with cuban food previously  rich flavor characterized our meals best  i cant wait to go back and try something else","2100":"i usually do not eat at fast food places however this is an exception to my rule unlike other fast food chains that use selections of one or more from the following categories frozen prepackaged foods processed foods meats that have added artificially growth hormones products that contain pesticides and artificial flavored and colored food products the panda express uses fresh vegetables and the cooks make everything in woks as the orders are taken the food is delicious and freshly made according to the website businessfranchisecom the panda express is a franchised business wikipedia documents as of june 2015 there are 1746 locations in the usa and puerto rico andrew cherng and his parents are from jiangsu a province in china in 1973 andrew and his father chef ming tsai cherng opened their first restaurant in pasadena ca andrew dreamed of sharing his fathers authentic recipes for delicious chinese cuisine with the american people andrew also wanted to offer a choice of delicious entr\u00e9es at inexpensive prices as destiny intervened in andrews life it just so happened that andrew met terry donahue the head football coach at ucla and dan donahue who was terrys brother just so happened to have a realtor company donahue schriber real estate that managed the glendale galleria an upscale shopping center don offered andrew the opportunity of a lifetime to develop a fastfood version of his restaurants entr\u00e9es and his fathers delicious recipes as fate would have it this was just the beginning of panda express","2104":"ive been generally pleased with the fare at chefs market except for a lemon cake i had oncethe cake was great and frosting was too much  great variety","2106":"finally i made my way to elm cafe they post their delicious creations on twitter elmcafe and id been meaning to stop by  although the breakfast wrap options were tempting i wasnt too hungry so i ordered a peachapple muffin since i dont often bake with peaches at home and it was great a goodsized muffin so i had half then and saved half for later also grabbed a small cappuccino  perfect size tasty and with coffee art  there isnt a lot of space inside the cafe about 45 bar stools so i could see it getting crowded in busy hours the woman at the counter was friendly the other patrons were too  when strangers are relaxed chatting with each other i feel like i fit into the atmosphere of a venue  ill be back for sure","2107":"had the bourbon banana sundae the bananas were caramelized to perfection and i could really taste the bourbon also tried the after dinner mint ice cream nothing special place is a little pricy but worth it service was a little slow but the place was full","2110":"ordered the swiss chocolate pancakes and they were very good but the chocolate was a bit sweet for my taste even without syrup i think if i had scraped off a bit of the chocolate i wouldve given this place 5 stars maybe next time ill try something different","2118":"i heart this tj location as its near my place of work and just off the freeway for a quick exit on 202 or 76 which can be important when you have a bag full of tjs finest frozen cuisine only 4 stars bc on more than two occasions theyve been out of my grocery staples like unsweetened almond milk and fruitsauce how dare they and the parking lot is super crummy and hard to get in or out of not tjs fault but still sour point the staff is awesome and fun  always willing to give suggestions and plugging their fav products they are usually right about what to try also all tjs have the policy of if you dont like it bring it back  half eaten used etc awesome customer service here great floral inventory plus a wine  spirits just three doors down","2120":"we always make a trip here when we are on the north side of indy they always have a great selection of beer available they also always have free popcorn no other food for purchase but you can bring your own or order from takeout menus they have dog friendly  watch out for the brew bus they commonly visits it can get pretty busy when they show up the employees are good at warning people before their arrival","2123":"after a long hot hike in the city park arboretum i stopped by this great snowball spot there is nothing better for cooling off on a hot day than their sweet slushee goodness while i approached i was shocked and delighted to not find a long line out front which is rare i guess i got lucky with my timing today   the man working the counter was very helpful as there was not a mass of people behind me i took the time to ask after special flavor combinations they offered after he named off a few which all sounded good i opted to go for my own flavor combo   my snowball was served within minutes to order the ice nicely shaved and the flavors delicious the condensed milk was in perfect proportion to the ice after i took a few bites and started to walk off the man at the counter called out to ask how it was it was amazing as always and the perfect treat for this hot day   i like that they keep the cost down in this popular spot gives the chance for kids to come with their pocket money id love to see a bench or two for seating but the hood of my car did nicely today","2124":"my date and i came here for dessert only and were really happy we stopped by   it was pretty late on a saturday but the restaurant was very busy being new to the st louis area i didnt know the cyranos reputation and was surprised when the waitress so causally asked if we were dining or in for dessert only lots of restaurants balk at the idea of you coming in for only one item but not cyranos   we order the cherries jubilee and sat back and enjoyed the presentation and dessert  would come back again to order from the main menu","2125":"if parking doesnt shy you away this location is quite quaint it has enough little table seating outside and inside to allow for a great business meeting or a coffee with a friend  staff is pretty friendly and they  havent got my order wrong yet so got to give it four stars for that","2130":"i love molldelis their famous philly is really good as is everything else my vegetarian friends have no problem finding something eat neither do meat eaters such as myself sure its not cheap  but im willing to spend a little more to eat local","2131":"the best thing about this place is the plethora of appetizers available its great to order a few and share with your friends they have a wide variety of better than average spirits and some good craft cocktails on the menu","2136":"probably the best place to go for burgers and fries in this area the quality fluctuates a little this is why the 4 stars finally they added milkshakes  and they are good simple concept good food lively atmosphere","2141":"i just had the beignets with a chocolate milk they were fresh and piled high with confectioners sugar as the picture shows they were crispy enough to satisfy that desire but soft enough not to be overdone like funnel cakes the taste was great simple with enough fat to balance out the sugar so it wasnt too sweet definitely worth the less than 2 charge   the ambiance was fine having seating both inside with ac and outside it was cafeteria style and for those who dont feel like even stepping out of their cars there is a drive through otherwise parking is relatively easy they have their own lot unlike at the original cafe in downtown new orleans then again here in this place outside downtown youre surrounded by memories of anywhere else taco bell gas stations etc","2142":"they have good nonpariel cookies","2145":"we were shopping in indianapolis on recent trip and craving something sweet we saw the flying cupcake and stopped by on the way back from the mall it was around 6 or 7 on a saturday afternoon and there was not many cupcakes left choose from i think they had wedding cake cupcake lemon blueberry raspberry and birthday cake cupcake but only about four of each i saw the lemon filled lemon cupcake and went for that my girlfriend got the blueberry cream cheese cupcake when we got out to the car i took one bite of this cupcake and my taste buds exploded it was so good i hadnt had dinner yet so i vowed to eat the rest after dinner i couldnt stop eating this cupcake it was gone before we even got over to chickfila for dinner my girlfriend was driving so she couldnt shove her face quite as quick as i could but she had half of hers gone by the time we got over to chickfila she was a good girl and saved the other half of hers for after dinner if im ever in the area again ill trying stopping by earlier in the day the man working the counter said they had a bigger selection in the morning","2148":"i like it i like it   because its new business you have to understand they really get backed up  wait time can be 12 hrs yes your heard correct  luckily i only waited 20 minutes from start to finish so it wasnt too bad ice cream favor  presentation  temp  texture  creaminess 4  definitely worth the wait     im anticipating my next trip  pre planning what favors i like to try next i know youll enjoy it  they open everyday too","2154":"honestly this place is pretty good ive gone here several times and never had a bad experience food is good and the workers have all been cool the only negative i could say about the place is that its slightly over priced specially for being in iv i typically go to noodle city but if i wanna go somewhere close then pho bistro is convenient and pretty good would suggest going there if you want a quick pho fix","2156":"youll enjoy it more if you go with your laid back friends who dont complain about waiting in lines and go with the flow its a cool atmosphere and the bands are sit and chill types i just went with my husband and we only got 4 things before we were full so make sure your crew is cool enough to share food also even though it starts at 6 many trucks werent ready til 630longer line waits the later you go but everything is running","2159":"ive visited costco locations in three different countries and you know what there really arent that many differences each costco location has a good amount of bulk items along with some furniture clothing books and other items that one might want to buy i visited with a friend recently to mostly buy some grocery items and personal care items and we were in and out of the store in less than 15 minutes this location was very convenient it wasnt very busy we were there shortly after it opened my friend mentioned that it was usually much busier and while the parking lot had some ice and snow in it it was a pretty smooth shopping experience","2162":"im only giving four stars because in comparison to other locations this one has some damn friendly and fast staff  the food is on par with what you would expect the only gripe i have is that i asked for extra pickles and they only gave me one extra one wah ","2167":"got the island green smoothie pretty good prices and great tasting smoothie detoxing this wolfpack sweet sixteen loss away","2173":"the pizza here is unique and very tasty you get a good amount of toppings for the money and the salads are crisp and cold  good too really nice place to take the family","2177":"just went to in riva for the first time i had heard they had a dog area and wanted to enjoy the evening with my benny the pizzanpuppies area was great the tables were  a little low dogs could easily reach if they wanted but considering ive never seen something like it before i really liked the concept   i had the mushroom and zucchini pizza and it was alright the crust was amazing but i didnt know the pie would have a kick and i truly dislike spicy next time i know to tell them no spice and theyll leave it off i think without the spice the pizza would be great  update i have been to in riva a few times since writing this original post just say dont add spice and the pizza will come out amazing at least if youre like me and dont like food spicy  check their facebook page before heading out on a tuesday because you need a password for half price pizza","2185":"as with all publix locations i have been to in florida over the years this store is much older than the stores in nashville  and it shows despite the age of the building and shelves this store was clean  it seems smaller since the stores here also carry a large selection of beachgoing items and have an aisle solely for wine somehow it is all crampacked in thereneatly  i thought the produce section at this location was very tastefully displayed and wellstocked   the staff was not engaging but when asked helpful","2187":"awesome tour this is a definite must do when visiting the st louis area the tour guides were fun and made the tour not just entertaining but interesting as well","2188":"excellent meal we shared a very nice size portion mediterranean salad which they split into two plates my better half enjoyed the white shrimp scampi and i ordered the black bass with risotto and fresh veggies the fish was fresh flavorful and cooked to perfection their homemade desserts were extremely appealing we decided on the coconut cream cake and lemon sorbet both excellent","2194":"zimmers seafood located at an underdeveloped pedestrian friendly intersection in the heart of voscoville prepares arguably the best dressed shrimp poboy in town castnets are very good as well you pay for quality here as zimmers is not the cheapest but we want real shrimp not the dried bite sized variety right of course my only gripe is that they are closed on sundays in opposition to my stomachs occasional sunday poboy craving check it out","2195":"hot stuff is pretty good another reviewer said that it isnt that hot on the nashville hot chicken scale and i agree i requested the hottest they got and it rates about a regular hot at princes not entirely a deal breaker for me as the flavor is actually really good  in terms of flavor i like pepperfire for heat 400 degrees and princes and very surprisingly wingbasket i have yet to try boltons but i plan to very soon   the guys at hot stuff also have hot ribs which seems really interesting and ill review again when i get around to trying it they also have hot chicken salad so if youre into plants and all that there it is  the menu is a lil diverse so unlike the original hot chicken joints this place has fish and ribs too  all in all its good when youre on the south side and want some hot chicken  its not the hottest chicken but its still good  ordering is best called in","2199":"i have never found this market to be anything sensational except that when i need something not run of the mill like honey with the comb or something organic i usually find it here  they stock a lot of not seen everywhere items and the store appears very clean unlike a few in the neighborhood","2202":"very nice atmosphere lot of space and friendly staff  coffee smells fresh and they also have a drive through","2204":"this place is always there for me when i need a pick me up the coffee is great as great as convenience store coffee can be and theres always an energy drink of sorts on sale you can find a decent lunch in a pinch as well the vegetarianvegan section has some good finds and the chicken tenders are surprisingly good and inexpensive the staff is always friendly and more than willing to help you or grab what you want if its not on the shelf as much as i love  miss wawa i am thankful for a nice clean friendly place to grab caffeine close to my work","2208":"this place was pretty cool the decor will remind you of the great gatsby their pesto sauce is delicious and they make their own soda syrup only reason it didnt get 5 stars was that it took a while for someone to come and ask what we wanted to drink the food we got was very good though it is a place i would visit again if i get back to st louis would want to try their ice cream cocktails","2209":"great place for really good greek dining  even though touristy area this is authentic greek food served with care and excellent ingredients  very fair prices too nice greek wine list with beers and greek liquors  staff is knowledgeable and very helpful  weve been here several times and never disappointed   busy place but they handle it well  great appetizers umppagels and big selection of great greek dessert  we shared a gyro platter with 3 appetizers and dessert and price was less than 40  great buy for exquisite lunch   i will return","2213":"chicken  waffles  by far the best ive ever had flavorful and moist chicken fluffy waffles with the best country gravy ive ever had  my husband had a grain bowl that was also very good nice selection of beer and wines   put this on your list of dinner options","2223":"our second time to cafe fleur de lis  we went to their other location a couple days ago  the food was so good had the shrimp n grits that we had to come back for more  the prices were reasonable for what you get  the quality of food were good with service to match    i loved their shrimp and grits but this time i had to try their seafood benedict seafood cakes made of crawfish and crab mixture  it comes with a choice of hash brown has a slight little kick or grits  my friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs benedict and vegetable omelette the coffee was good  and so was the mocha coffee  piled high whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top   overall our second dining experience was great  this is a little hidden foodie find and gem of a place  you wont be disappointed","2226":"not really any seating no air conditioning inside but the bagels are fresh and kettlecooked kind of a hole in the wall im sure we would never want to know just how dirty the kitchen is but the bagel tasted like sweet sweet love","2228":"to update the business owner has been in contact and has apologized and made up for it overall the bareburger experience in center city does have potential to be a good restaurant to check out","2236":"staying in the area wine works was a convenient choice from my hotel the selection of craft beers was big but the prices were a bit steep we splurged and had fun making up our own sixpack  it seems 350 for a regular 12 oz is a lot even if it has a high alcohol content   the wines were divided up in a few different ways smart marketing on their part there were sections based on price based on specials on velvety versus bold and of course by region there is also a tasting area that apparently requires you having a member card the membership is probably a good idea as its free and offered some good discounts","2238":"we had both of the two french toastsboth were good the pork belly benni pleased but my steak and and eggs biscuit was the best  this place gets mobbed on a weekend morning by 900 am theres a long wait and parking is a problem too","2244":"well thats weird i really feel like i reviewed this wine works at some point in the past apparently not  ive been coming here longer than any other liquor store in the area believe it or not from the check ins prior to becoming nutty about the suds i was in love with new jersey wines wine works was my standard spot for valenzano heritage sharrott etc  i stopped in yesterday afternoon since it was right on my way home from the shore area all the usual vino suspects are still wellstocked on the shelves but i headed straight for the beer  first off check the dates some of the beers are dusty and thats a bit disconcerting depending on the style  second make your own sixpack i do this whenever possible in general and they do have a nice selection here much larger than wegmans smaller than total wine and maybe on par with canals depending on the location  also check out their large format bottles i was surprised to find transmitter brewing in stock transmitter is a tiny brewery on long island city like super tiny like only a few people can comfortably fit in their tasting area at a time definitely try their stuff if you see it and like your beer on the funky side  check out is always efficient obviously be prepared to present your id if youre anything like me and could pass for a 19yearold  probably the best part of wine works very reasonable prices my 6pack of pretty good stuff came out to 14aka the price ive paid for one beer on draft on a few occasions","2245":"royal street barkmmmim dreaming of our next encounter ohhi can order you online you say   f the diet  the fudge is also a winnerif littered candy goodness isnt your bagsorry i just cant justify giving this place 5 stars for making my ass look fat ","2248":"renovation of the historic building was thoughtful and well executed food was greatservice was excellent everyone in the party was impressed and will return","2249":"my wife and i came here for dessert on a busy friday night frost has a really big selection of gelato flavors  maybe 20 or so  and an assortment of sorbets my wife settled on pistachio and amaretto both were really good but i think the pistachio was a bit better   while the flavors of gelato were quite good i have to agree with brenner ts review that says that allegro is a better quality product than frost if you compare the gelato here to the same flavor at allegro it will lose but frosts strength is the variety  many more flavors than allegro and the gelato here is still quite good  a solid 4 stars but i wouldnt take an italian here looking for authentic stracciatella gelato   frost also benefits from its location  next door to two very popular restaurants  sauce pizza and wine and wildflower its a great spot for some light dessert after a meal","2252":"old glory  you make a perfect not too limey gimlet for this reason alone i will always be a fan","2254":"delicious food all the food is made to order fresh as it can be the service is fast and really friendly if your a grilled cheese lover and quesadilla lover this is the place for you the soups are made fresh everyday and is different option everyday we will be coming back","2255":"the drinks was strong the food was good i recommend this place i was there yesterday celebrating a friends birthday i will be making another visit sometime this month i get a space of thumbs up","2258":"went here for lunch on a friday i got the fried chicken tenders hot with the collard greens and macaroni and cheese all three were really good it was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two the chicken was juicy and well cooked but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce the sides were also well made i was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but im glad i didnt a friend had ordered it but didnt finish it because she said it wasnt good i tried a bit of it and completely agreed idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good i usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home boiled or baked with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had other than that what i enjoyed my meal i would be interested in trying other options it was great for a quick lunch even with a long line we ordered and got our food pretty quickly the staff was also really friendly","2259":"tried a flat white for the first time on the recommendation of a friend thanks amy p the first location i went to said no i couldnt because they were out of whole milk this location though they were more than happy to oblige the service was quick and efficient the barista was both bubbly and sweet as she made my drink order   the drink itself was tasty not sweet but rich on the tongue next time i get this ill see if they can add vanilla to it","2260":"love this place  i always come here for quick delicious donuts  chocolate cake with chocolate frosting is delicious  the place itself is tiny though  however i am not giving this place 5 stars because last saturday night i came here around 10pm to grab late night donuts the lady who waited on us was not friendly at all  didnt even say hi or welcome or anything  not a fan of that type of customer service","2264":"i used to live out in the tampa bay area and as far as casinos go there isnt much of a selection but this casino is by far the best its glamour and shine lives up to the name of hardrockthey have a huge guitar in front at the entrance that is really cool plus they have a huge poker room that is mighty inviting to those looking to play some cardsdefinitely a must stay and play if you are in the area","2265":"service was a little slow but food makes up for it i had the shepherd pie and my husband had the trout wow it was super tasty","2269":"happy international burger day we have been coming here for a couple years and havent been disappointed hubby always has the spicy crunch combo and i had the double mushroom double cheese combo one with curly fries the other with regular fries each came with ketchup and a herb aioli as well as a fountain pop i have also tried the blue cheese burger and their signature bj burger which are equally delicious fresh quality ingredients are used we would give it a 5 but we thought the tables and benches could be updated you have the option of customizing your burgers as a mini clip board and marker are at each table with a list of ingredients unfortunately diners have scribbled on the tables and benches perhaps a sheet of glass or plexiglass on the tables would make it easier to clean","2273":"great coffee great donuts great place there was a line the whole time we were there which is a good sign","2277":"raving review from californian outsider  i came by for lunch during one of the many crowded conferences im sure st louis gets holler urbana12 my friend and i found seats at the bar as others were clearing out got kind of lucky there and our server was a delightfully facial haired man who walked us through menu selections and sassed me like we were best friends  im kind of a cheapo so the pricey burgers were at first a turn off but i had heard very good things about their specialty burgers from other friends i helped myself to the basic burger which i asked for cooked all the way and was pleasantly not dry at all you know what else was delightful their homemade ketchup perfectly sweet and perfectly ketchupy  the order did take a bit longer to come out than i would have liked but watching my sassy nonrobot server make lots of different drinks for other customers ameliorated the pain of the wait thanks baileys range ill miss you forever","2282":"the place is wonderful  the food is excellent  though if you plan on going during the weekend try to get there right at 800  i had a party of five and got there around 825 and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated  i found it interesting that the staff chose to sit a group of 3 in an area that could have sat 6  again the brunch was amazing and our waitress was the nicest waitress weve had in recent memory  ive been there for brunch and for lunch  its the best  though the teenager hostesses need to figure out how to distribute guests better  but what do you expect  theyre probably u of a students","2286":"my first time  wont be last  smoky aromas hit you when you enter  everything is home made  my guest had the daily sausage sandwich excellent texture and flavour  my sandwich was filled with tender beef cheese and their homemade candied beets  large portions rustic decor open kitchen   vegans stay home although their roasted veg side dish was great i need to go back and try brunch real meat real cooking oh and dark rye  yum","2291":"i love a doughnut theyd be part of my last meal on death row and i would be happy if they were purchased from upper nine we walked 40 minutes to their new tempperm location and it was worth every step the owner was super cool told us about the business and helped us pick out 3 awesome doughnuts to share we had the louisiana strawberry chocolate salted caramel and the key lime pie the only doughnut to  ever start a fight they were all great but the key lime pie was super special coffee was strong and great too","2293":"burgers were ok service was a little slow which was surprising considering it was dead in there apps were fantastic","2294":"the last time i was here was when i was in high school at the old restaurant if anyone remembers that  very nice set up inside comfy booths nice staff  our pizza took a little longer than anticipated but was tasty their presentation was the most intriguing  they slice the pizza in half and place each half on different tiers to bring out to the table  have local crafted beers on tap from mastrys brewing   good selection of food","2300":"we tried the veg lunch combo and it was very well made healthy like a simple home made meal  also tried pastries dil pasand  samosa less oily and they were good too  overall it was a good experience ","2301":"our goto place for a special coriander sauce this grocery store is very overlooked and a good place to go for unique indian ingredients and food that you cant find anywhere else","2304":"my mother and i stopped in here for lunch upon recommendations from friends i tried the daily bread special and she had the veggie we both loved our sandwiches we also split a bowl of turkey noodle soup that was a nice complement to our meal we bought a gooey butter cake too which was absolutely outstanding   only gripe was marginally friendly staff and a very slim variety of chips   definitely give the daily bread a try","2305":"good basic pizza good crust typical older pizza place environment friendly to newbies would go there again","2308":"good food parking hard to find great for businesses lunch great historic building i had short ribs definitely going to order again","2309":"i never knew this place was here   a comfortable clean environment with seating downstairs i always prefer savory vs sweet so i ordered the norwegian crepe and it was so good and filling  i would love to go back there and try all their other options and maybe share a sweet one for dessert","2326":"went to dinner with friends started out with the beet and goat cheese salad it was very good for the entree i had the fishermans stew it was good but not as good as i had hoped decent amount of seafood and a nice but not great broth also i couldnt understand why it wasnt served with bread would have been nice to be able to dip it in the sauce service was good and attentive atmosphere was fine","2334":"a nice neighborhood feel but it isnt the first place to pop into mind when asked for recommendations the interior and service are nice but the food and drinks are pricey for what is served unless you go for their outdoor summer happy hour","2336":"if youre looking for a great happy hour then this is your spot their happy hour menu has many choices for drinks and appetizers my mom and i frequently go to on the border for margaritas because they are delicious if you go during the summer you must try the watermelon margarita  the only complaint i have ever had here is their service on the border is frequently getting new employees who arent always as attentive as youd like your service to be it is common to wait long periods of time for your bill or even need a refill for chips and a drink","2338":"they never forget to say welcome to moooooes i find the menu somewhat confusing everything ive had is good queso is soso guacamole is soso service is fast though even at weekday lunch time","2339":"we encountered a short wait but were called in about10 minutes we ordered garlic clams clam chowder fresh oysters and the crab sandwich got photos of most except the crab sandwich as it was soooo delicious it was gone before i managed to take a photo  service is ok but super casual   great fresh seafood yum","2347":"great service excellent food we were visiting nashville and lucky to have found this place for lunch","2353":"healthy and simple dishes  fresh  not overcooked    ive only ordered off the asian menu  i love the bangkok curry with tofu  their tofu is cut to the perfect size and has a nice firmness    the thai curry soup is also awesome","2362":"i like this yogurt shop though i wish they had just a few more flavors the toppings are pretty good though the bananas were obviously not holding up well someone should tell them that bananas get gross after a while  pricing is soso i mostly go here because its superconvenient","2364":"strawberry smoothie you are too good to me if youre still okay with drinking cold drinks before work when its 20 degrees outside head to starbucks   the staff is friendly the drinks are delicious although they are overpriced and all of the christmas goodies inside are awesome   great place to relax or prep for a work day   see you again soon southport starbucks","2368":"had a spare moment before getting my hair done so i stopped at tebella for a snack i was pleasantly surprised by the quaint little shop i ordered the key lime mocktail and the chocolate chip scone the handcrafted tea took about 5 minutes to make but was amazing not too sweet and the perfect amount of lime i ate the scone while i waited and it was perfection i wish id ordered 2 great little spot ill definitely be back","2370":"kalamatas is a greek and mediterranean casual restaurant located near green hills mall they have a good reputation for being a great place for a quick cheap bite i prefer getting something here at kalamatas over any  other fast food because kalamatas is really just as fast and the food is infinitely better and the same price  they have lunch specials that are really a bargain   i cant really comment on the authenticity ive never been to greece but i think their food is full of flavor i am a fan of the falafel here  thats what i always like to order  get over to kalamatas for lunch try to come early or late to beat the rush though","2375":"perfect if you know what you want and just drive through a little cluttered feeling if you decide to park in front and walk around looking for something newdifferent the guys that work there are always nice and friendly   gets 4 stars in my book for being a rare commodity in this part of the us having competitive pricing not necessarily the cheapest in the area a decent selection and a cool staff","2377":"literally my favorite restaurant here in new orleans my friend told me i need to invest in the restaurant between going there so much and ordering on postmates i love the atmosphere and the food of course i order the same thing every time pork and shrimp rolls shakin new york strip with fried rice add egg and a cobbler to drink i try looking at the menu to try something new but my heart knows what it wants its never too crowded and has an overall good vibe","2378":"standard subway nothing special fast friendly service they have gotten rid of the monterey cheddar bread though so that sucks","2381":"delicious so delicious why do they not have a sign anywhere that says cash only we definitely had to send my brother out to get cash when the bill came embarrassing  i had the pad kee mao drunken noodles which were delicious though the menu said theyd be spicy and they didnt even have a slow burn thing going on next time i would get it spicier lots of beef in it though they definitely did not skimp on that  my parents both ate pad thai and loved it i snagged a bite of my moms chicken pad thai and it was pretty yummy i prefer greasy spicy noodles though  the desserts here are so so good a bit overpriced maybe 6 a piece but delicious i had the sticky mango rice my mother ate the chocolate banana egg roll my brother had the banana tempura all yummy  my dad clearly made the right choice when he ordered the coconut ice cream it came in half a coconut and there was so much ice cream i dont know if they make it on location or if they get it elsewhere but i could definitely eat it every day  im going to drag my brother here for the rest of the time hes at upenn im into it","2386":"costco  wholesale shopping off 86th and michigan  road is one of my favorite places to shop while i dont buy many food items in bulk their food is fresh and great quality this place has a great selection of merchandise and whats even better is costco stands by every item they sell if youre not 100 happy  just return it for a full refund no questions asked amazing customer service  costco has yet to disappoint me but plan on waiting in line if you shop there during prime shopping hours especially on weekends best to get there when they first open to beat the crowds  costco rocks ","2388":"i have always enjoyed my pizzas here my current favorite is the yales thai i get it wout chicken and with sesame seeds because i do not like peanuts on my food i love every bite another favorite has been the lil stevie my husband likes the teriyake chicken bbq chicken and the yales thai pizzas i would suggest going for the more creative pizzas i have tried the more simple pizza options and not been wowed that is just me though as i am thrilled by creatively flavorful foods the service has been consistent when i have dined here i purposefully opt for visiting during nonpeak hours so it is not too busy my only wish is that they would offer a gluten free crust and vegan cheese i would probably always get my pizza here if this was the case","2389":"the people there were super nice pizza came out really fast they have like 40 different toppings to chose from pizza was above average","2394":"great cake like donuts and the peanut butter fluff is their best one especially with peanuts i would say the best local place in the area","2398":"had a great time at this byob near northern liberties its just a little bit out of the way so though i really enjoyed it many years ago when it first opened i had not been until i saw a living social deal for a gift certificate and decided to try it again   am glad i did the sauces are well made and use a variety of great chiles for thisisdefinitelynotfromajarlikeothermexicanrestaurants quality i ended up having the empanaditas and a great cactus salad and was really impressed with the range of flavors they have a wide ranging menu and several great sounding specials   we also lucked out because the people next to us had thoughtfully brought more tequila than they needed and let us have a few glasses of the byot margaritas the mixes were fresh and flavorful and they will mix the tequila in for you   our only complaint was because it was so small every margarita order meant we had to be very near a loud blender but thats a small price to pay for excellent food friendly service and a lovely little restaurant","2399":"good solid food  i enjoy lunch here at least once a week    if you are in the cummins station area get lunch here   good food good service","2400":"very authentic great food and great salsa bar i really enjoyed it and loved the outdoor seating","2411":"although far from home i did like this store great produce and sales meat and fish are very pricy they carry items i cannot find elsewheregreat bulk item section  wish it were closer","2413":"great placegreat atmospheregreat food but not good for groupswaiter would not split the bill for a group of 10very inconvenient","2418":"recommended by our hotel they were spot on we sat at the bar as the wait was an hour for a table  this was a great choice  sarah the bartender was super friendly and helpful  the cherry limeade delicious  and the burgers fantastic","2420":"not as cool as the one in 12th south but its hard to create something hip in the middle of not hip suburbia burger up gets high marks for getting it close go sit at the bar its less hectic great cocktails  bartenders are  amazing fried pickles and the quinoa burger yum get there early remember its cool springs they roll up the carpets at 830 or is it that everyone heads to drakes","2428":"i went to this brewery for the first time a week ago i had the darkest beer they had and it was very good the only complaint i had was that the inside was fairly small but its supposed to be a brewery not a bar i guess","2433":"one of the best places to get a cheese steak in the area  they use really good meat and really pack it in  a bit on the small side so i recommend take out or delivery    just keep in mind  their small cheese steak is most other places large","2437":"i have been in a couple of times i would skip their pad thai i like it a particular way and either you got it or you dont  what i do like is a lot of other items like the sweet basil salmon or the nomnom salad i have also seen plenty of other dishes float by that i am willing to try  there expansion seems to have paid off  and its now much more comfortable to sit and stay a bit","2438":"love this neighborhood bakerypizza joint  the mushroom pizza is awesome once they warm it it is perfect    i have not tried all their delicious sweets  however their classic birthday cake is so good its not too sweet and has jam in the layer which gives it such a nice taste  the only compliant i have i wish there was a sitting area  i live not too far so it works the pizza stays warm ","2439":"for food truck food this place is hit or miss  they end up outside ms maes a lot  have had the pig sandwich the bacon barbecue burger and the crawfish mac and cheese  some is more delicious than others but a good options for the late night crowd","2441":"great food and sweets are out of this world snapper is just old world cook whole and super tasty service is great too one star less for cleanliness bathrooms need some major scribing and remodeling i hate to see kitchen  hahaha","2443":"i stopped in for lunch and everything was very good i realy like the road kill very good with mushrooms an  d onions smothered with melted cheese good job","2455":"the environment is cool and the service was awesome i will return solely for how delicious the fries were the only reason im not giving five stars is the cheese sauce on my burger was broken so it was very gritty and it was kind of hard to eat seriously though the fries","2457":"this is the closest mcdonalds to me always great hot fresh food you may need to wait a little but its worth it craziest thing they dont leave out napkins you need to ask other then that food is great","2459":"good bun pho and bahn mi havent explored the rest of the menu","2462":"so i love spicy food  at most places  i load on the hot sauce  so i assumed when i got the arroz con pollo with chicken rice and mexican sauage which was delicious that it wouldnt be spicy enough  i so stupidly didnt even taste it and asked for some hot sauce which they brought me in a dish  it looked like franks red hot so i dumped it on  big mistake  the hot sauce was so spicy which unbeknownst to me they charged me 1 for  it was so hot that i downed 5 glasses of water had tears in my eyes and couldnt finish the rest of my meal  on the plus side i was stuffed from water and hence didnt overeat  the service here is really fantastic  the server was so friendly and kept our water glasses filled  we had a groupon 15 for 30 and although it didnt say it on the groupon the server told us that it came with a free dessert  we got the crepes with bananas caramel and fresh berries which was tasty   you also get free chips and tomatillo sauce which was great  the place is byo takes credit cards and they offer different margarita mixes w your booze  they have a private room upstairs which is great to reserve for large groups","2472":"i had a meeting here on a weekday midmorning  maybe not the best place for a business meeting or for getting work done as it was super loud other patrons and music  but a great place nonetheless  a little pricey but you pay for what you get  my chai with almond milk  yay was very good  and that gluten free peanut butter cookie was out of this world good  wouldnt have known it was gf if it hadnt been labeled as such  the food looked good and i hope to have a chance to come back and try it","2473":"my first time at cracker barrel and i really liked it the food was good and i could not believe how inexpensive it was  our waitress was very sweet and attentive","2474":"cool place for coffee their crepes were ok they have pretty good baked goods tried their mint iced tea which was refreshing they can offer gluten free food which is not mentioned on the menu so you need to ask for it i think the whole setup was pretty cool and would def go back","2479":"it was our first time in philly last october and the weather was nice enough to we wander from neighborhood to neighborhood on the way back to the hotel we spied what looked like a pub at which to kill time before another restaurant opened  i was more than pleasantly surprised by the beer menu and the snacks including one of the best cheese plates ive ever tasted had us thinking we might have to cancel our other dinner reservations to round out a meal my wife had a fish dish with smushy peas and i had the sageapplepumpkin risotto  it was also early enough in the day that we completely missed the most of the dinnerdrinks after work crowd so the atmosphere held up we practically had the place to ourselves for a while all in all it was the perfect place to stumble into","2480":"fantastic new store huge and bright and so much great stuff theres a deli with freshly made meal options to go lasagna salads sides etc gorgeous desserts a meat department with meat already marinating and so many more aisles filled with other food  bulk bins as well with lots of beanslentils they have frozen meat and fish and the prices looked reasonable to me  the produce section seemed kind of small when you take into account how big this store is and the actually didnt have something i was looking for  this is overall a great organic grocery store","2484":"amazing new find small cute cafe with very reasonable prices for delicious food i tried the egg on gouda crepe with bacon which was delicious and well stuffed i just wish the gouda taste was a bit stronger and that there was some type of sauce to go with it the caramel ricotta crepe was delicious and very well prepared ill definitely be coming back to try the rest of their menu","2486":"with inspired brews and filling eastern european fare to soak up the alcohol crime  punishment is bringing the brewery back in brewerytown  i loved space dogs  smooth sour ipa with just the right amount of pineapple the mushroom pelmeni and potato and caramelized onion pierogies were big winners in my book i was not a fan of the pickle bowl all the veggies were overly salted and there was an unpleasant raw vinegar taste  the picnic benches and friendly service create an inviting laid back environment that wont tire you out i will definitely come back on a lazy weekend for beer and dumplings","2488":"i went today to buy a growler of oh coaly night  hard to get and just released the lady was helpful and worked with me as i did not have a growler she let me buy a 5 litre bottle and gfilled it and charged  me accordingly she could have blew me off the oh coaly was   is wonderful","2489":"their snow taro boba is the best  so yummy the staff which includes the owners are young but really nice ","2490":"hit this place frequently as i ditch the cafeteria at work  head to microsoft  dont need to be an employee great thing is you can order 12 portions  yup 12 the price too  food is top quality  well priced","2491":"in out in out every busy place has its methods just indicate on the board which seating your pref is  sounds like fast food or my first coitus experience  sure its the pier 39 long wharf alaskan way of sb but a tourist has got to eat  bisque and lobster tacos o miss molly good golly  between the wait good company fresh food and postcard views i forgot if the service was any good  it wasnt bad but then again you coulda punched me in the face as i was enjoyin myself that much","2504":"this was the first coffee shop i visited in philly trying to branch out from starbucks and i wasnt disappointed  the atmosphere is my favorite there is plenty of room and plenty of tables to sip your coffee or pull out books to study they offer free wifi the shrubbery at the front of the door adds to the charm and makes you feel like it is a secret spot haha as a plus the bathrooms are also very nice and clean  the staff is super great  quick to take orders and whip them up  i saw them walking around cleaning multiple times  i ordered a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk  it was very good it didnt have a strong pumpkin flavor with lots of spice which some people dont like a little pricey in my opinion around 5 for a small but thats usually how much lattes are anyways elsewhere    all in all i really enjoyed good karma and cant wait to go back grab a coffee and study","2505":"yay a new ice cream shopwhich has only been open a couple of weeks the space is small but i like the sparkly booth seats   the ice cream selection is small but there is definitely something for everyone i had the peach vanilla and it was fresh and tasty my only small point was that the peaches bits were large so they got a bit icy to the tooth but thats probably me just being a weirdo my friend loved her toasted coconut and it was yummy   the business is cash only and supposedly also has snowballs but i didnt see anyone get those while i was there","2507":"this is a really nice subway it has far too little parking the manager  staff were making the best of national sandwich day customers were everywhere my bogo subs were great we got the spicy italian  the tuna their tuna really is done just right not swimming in mayo a good taste the spicy italian was new to me but quite good whats a girl to do love subway  a bogo  i am a happy camper","2513":"location near usfs campus so a good opportunity for business  price fair for the amount of work that goes into it  wait time 30 mins 15 hrs depending on prime time   there arent enough tables to accommodate the amount of customers the ice cream itself is worth the wait the ice cream is creamy but has a flaky icy consistency which goes well with the toppings  the staff are efficient and friendly but theyre usually very focused on making your rolls  the protocol is to order the basic flavor with a fruit mixed in as well as 3 toppings  i would give it a higher rating if only the wait wasnt so long ive gone twice and both times it was packed there are people who will disregard the fact that you have been waiting in line to join their friends regardless of the number in their party be firm in asserting yourself so that you dont have to add to your wait time","2518":"aldi is a great grocery store because of the fabulously low prices  the store here at 52nd and keystone has also started carrying organic vegetables orange juice and some canned options like spaghetti sauce  bring a quarter so you can access a shopping cart and your own bags  they sell bags but we all know it just makes environmental sense to reuse  look for these favorites of mine  organic nacho chips fresh cilantro organic salad greens fresh salsa ready to bake pizzas for 5 not frozen special items in the cheese case and some pretty good coffee for 4  the lines look long but they really move pretty fast and if they get too long another cashier will come up and help","2527":"its been a while since ive visited a bjs and coming back it did not disappoint from what i remembered  first visited in the south this time it seemed like best option around the outlet  tasty and huge salads is what i remembered and it still is  the staff were friendly and place is spacious they have a very large variety of beer its not your hipster placed of beer just simple beer of different varieties that could be passed off as craft  they have coloring for kids and a lot of babies and kids seem to frequent here","2530":"tried olly frescos for the first time today its located on 107 street in the alberta health services seventh street plaza ground floor of the south tower its kind of like sunterra in that its mostly self serve though there is a soup 4 different kinds and sandwichpaninibreakfast counter at the back lots of choices for drinks water soda kombucha etc snacks like individually wrapped cheese 085 a piece and desserts cookies candies a decentsized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens all looking fresh and lots of toppings chicken breast deli meat other vegetables the hot food selfserve area also has about 10 choices 189100g  several meats today was roast beef au jus roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side butter chicken and another indian dish a fish i think it was breaded perogies with self serve bacon and sour cream dangerous and some veggies steamed broccoli and cauliflower roasted potato wedges and i assume there is always a vegetarian dish  todays was lasagna i may have forgotten about a few other dishes everything is labelled and relatively fresh  i saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits   i enjoyed the mishmash i picked up you use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers the lasagna was cheesy and flavourful despite not having any meat in it the noodles were not as al dente as i would have liked and it was a touch salty but overall i liked it the broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients  still bright green and just a touch of crunch the roast chicken was really popular  i dont know if it was legs only but i snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks  skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs indistinguishable though a touch dry but totally edible still i loved the perogies  they were very generic potato ones nothing special but not bad eg the right amount of dough and filling not mushy i loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits real ones as i wanted   theres quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go so i didnt have any trouble finding a spot for two around 1215pm it was busy though after grabbing a bottle of premium water my total came to about 13 and i was certainly quite full you can spend as much or as little as you want to i thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses and i love the variety of choices  i understand that they change offerings daily so id be interested to try other options i think its a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown note its closed on weekends i will be back","2531":"i surprised my girl with dinner at baileys range and she was excited to go  being a burger aficionado i was happy to indulge my girls burger passion  at the same time we were excited because the range makes everything from scratch  and i mean everything right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces  if they made their own glassware plates and silverware i think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level    we got there shortly after the range opened so seating was not a problem  our server took our drink orders  she had a dark beer and i had the sweet sweet bacon  a milkshake with makers mark candied bacon and salted caramel ice cream  the shake was good  i think mine might have had a little too much makers mark knocking the balance of the drink off but i didnt mind  it had been a long week up to thursday  we skipped appetizers and went right to mains  she ordered the american burger and was more than happy  then again who wouldnt want a fried macn cheese patty atop their burger which was cooked medium rare appropriately the way she wanted it on a soft bun double score for her  i ordered the ahh jamn which was supposed to come with bacon jam red onions i had asked for caramelized onions mushrooms and cheddar cheese  when my burger came out i was ready to kill it so started enjoying it  about midway through the experience it dawned on me  is this my burger  i didnt really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms though it looked like it might have been on there  the cheese enveloped my burger so it was hard to tell whether i had the right burger  but i pressed on anyway because i was hungry  we also ordered a large order of fries and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce  the fries were great and the homemade sauces were divine  overall this was a good experience  in hindsight i should have said something to our server regarding my burger but i chose not to  that was my bad  thats the only reason why i give baileys 45 stars rather than 55 stars  that being said that only means that ill be back there again to try something different because baileys range is worth it","2535":"i  dream of a day they will open a venue in colorado i know the best thing about this chain is their tasty slushes and that we get long cold winters but they are addictive and if we have friggen pinkbies we should have an eegees   those tasty treats go amazingly with booze and i must get one each trip to tucson  the food is why it doesnt get a fifth star but who goes there for the food  star light star bright","2539":"i heard quiet a few things about this place from people all around i noticed that they opened one up by where i live so i decided to check outfive guys burgers and fries yes i know there is a typo and no i am not the one who posted the business listing edit looks like they fixed the typo i guess no yummy french feies for me   when i got there they had a long line out the door the thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be worth the wait as i inched my way to the counter which took about 25 minutesi finally got to the cashier she was very friendly and explanatory about the menu she gave me suggestions to order so i picked what i wanted and placed my order  i ordered the bacon cheese burger with cajun fries they give you multiple options of what you want on your burger the toppings i chose were grilled onionsgrilled mushrooms lettuce tomato and mayo the burger was fantastic i also tried the cajun fries they were good also still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head they sell hot dogs at five guys so i might keep that as an optionalso for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger   one thing that i will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil also they have free peanuts available for customers if you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably not for you i just thought i would throw in that disclaimer another heads up is how busy this place gets you may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied the prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under 10   it still boggles my mind that this place is fast food because it is almost as good as most gourmet burger spots i will admit that for a chain fast food restaurant this place is top shelf this place is definitely worth checking out  in short good foodgood prices and good service who could ask for anything more","2545":"freshgreek authentic  theres a reason this place is number one in tarpon springs just watch out for dropping olives into the liquid you willsplash your shirt  isnt  that the sign of a good meal is that you wear it on the front of you","2547":"non food things friendly attentive service new clean space lots of seating   food things delicious tofu bao delicious bubble tea huge portions tofu with brown sauce came with vegetables and rice and was good but i wish i had ordered something with a bit more punch might try something spicy next time or the tofu with bok choy update sesame tofu and saut\u00e9ed green beans are great really flavorful especially for vegetarian options the taiwanese rice noodles were good a little less flavorful than i had hoped but they were much better leftover the next day still need to try the scallion pancakes","2548":"better cookies  try the chinese jewish deli cookies very good cakes  but priced a bit high  need 48 hours notice for large cakes  a good place to know about for sure","2550":"we love the rolled ice cream here the choice of toppings is also a big hit with the kids a nice change from those other ice cream shops","2554":"best coffee in philadelphia located in a nofrills cafe in fact there isnt even a menu a small selection of pastries and caffeinated drinks but definitely come here for the coffee smooth and wellpriced","2557":"excellent amount of food with their early bird specials from 25pm food was average at best people were friendly and everything was clean prices were pretty good","2566":"it was your average target experience  the staff at this target were very nice  most of the staff i ran into greeted me with a smile and a do you need help    store was clean and organized  parking was easy  i gave it 4 stars because the water selection was almost completely gone  shelves were nearly empty and selection was sorely lacking","2567":"place was a nice hidden gem on maggazine st donuts for days and bomb sliders if you want to get fat eat here got the maple bacon donut salted caramel donut and coconut cream all were yum yum then got the fried chicken slider oyster duck and pork belly sliders fried chicken was the best all needed more spreadsauce but still yummy most affordable lunch we had in nola","2568":"fantastic little byob the antipasto salad and gnocchi were excellent contrary to some other reviews about the crowded seating i thought it was rather spacious there are other byobs in philadelphia that are much smaller i will be back here again soon","2569":"i came here in a group and they were very nice about accommodating all of us i loved their basil ginger lemonade which had just the right amount of sugar we shared a bunch of appetizers and two pizzas and everything was rather tasty i enjoyed the meatballs too nothing was particularly memorable but it was a pleasant time and the patio looks like a lovely place to chill on a springsummer night","2570":"i dont think there is anything i can add that people havent already said but ill try ive had my share of gourmet donuts and i can truly say that the brown butter pistachio chocolate glazed and the cookies and cream donut are some of the best donuts had the brown butter pistachio has a nice nutty flavor with slightly salty salty pistachios the chocolate glazed is chocolatey yet not overwhelmingly sweet in fact its actually quite sinfully dark and the cookies and cream is sweet and crunchy and delicious other than the donuts ive tried their fries and the fries are delicious the cheesy fries are good but the cheese has a slightly gritty feel to it thats about the only thing keeping me from giving that a 5 star review over all its a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner and a big ol donut for dessert oh and the free wifi and the ambiance is spot on","2574":"i finally made it to hellas the fact that ive kept it in mind for years tells you two things   1 i am lazy 2 everyone talks about therefore it is always embedded in my head   the food was fantastic our table ordered the chicken souvlaki combination platter greek salad burger yeah there was one weirdo and a side of dolmades all delicious   they were kind enough to allow me to purchase the side of dolmades despite it not being on the menu as a side they were served with a lemon sauce and had a lot of meat inside i am used to always having them without sauce and with mostly rice  this was a surprising and delicious change   i enjoyed the decor and artwork on the walls and ceiling and the fact that the ac felt great despite us sitting close to the outside opening was superb  service was fast and friendly except waiting for a waiter to initially be assigned to us  hi yes were still over here lots of looking at us and no one coming over once one of them did he was great   we were stuffed so no desert but we must come back to try the bakery oh em gee so many huge and beautifully crafted treats","2578":"tonight was our first time at tired hands we came in for taco monday which means 2 off every taco on the menu  halfprice pints of hophands and saisonhands the tacos  the beers we tried hop saison helles other people cause  concern and paper mansions were all incredible i do wish that the tortillas used for the tacos has been warmed instead of just filled but tacos were still good nonetheless service was super friendly as well wish we lived closer so this place could become one of our regular spots but well definitely be back soon","2584":"this place was magnificent great food if you order the cheese you get ur waitress to flame it right infront of you with a big opa the muscles were great taste and very fresh the lamb was amazing great variety of cuts and very well cooked i would recommend this place with my eyes close  the only reason why i dont give them a 5 star is because they had no parking or coat rooms","2586":"i must say i was hesitant to eat here after seeing some of the yelp reviewsi was however pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the staff  we sat at the bar as we typically do and had just a great experience    my only less than positive comment is regarding the sports bar labelno dont think they can yet call it that  they really need more tvs before that label would stick  im not going there football day    this place is great for kids and adults alike   i look forward to exploring the menu more in the future","2588":"the ice is just like hansens nice and soft and pillowy they didnt have sugar free wedding cake but i went with the half wedding cake and half orchid vanilla which was pretty good added condensed milk very happy with it and it was only 275 and huge  recommend this place i live uptown but may make the trek over here when i dont feel like waiting in a huge line at hansens snow is just as good and half the price  cash only","2590":"my first time ever to this diner on a weekday as soon as i entered in this diner it felt like entering in someones home its a cozy diner with very friendly servers there are so many good diners in the area and this one is def one of the finest the serving sizes are huge the omelettes are great i didnt try anything sweet so cant say how were the pancakes or french toasts but the menu has so many different options and they all looked very good specially the sandwiches i had an egg benedict which was ok nothing wrong with it but nothing great either portion size was huge my wife had an omelette with onions and american cheese which was very good  again i liked her order better than mine lol you pay the bill at the counter after you finish eating  i would go back again and would try other things on the menu","2597":"took the whole fam jam including gramma out to wok house last night in st albert  weve been eagerly awaiting the opening this past week because their banner outside read  chinese dim sum bubble tea  yep thats right  st albert now has dim sum and bubble tea  the location is in the old banana leaf restaurant next door to simply donair in the same strip mall as dairy queen  we were greeted by a friendly family who let us choose anywhere in the restaurant to sit  kiddos opted for the boothbench option  the decor was modern and clean  the menu variety really surprised me and all dim sum is cooked to order rather than coming around on carts   we decided we might as well go hard and try stuff from all parts of the menu  first off we ordered bubble teas  fresh fruit mango dairy free with sago fresh fruit peach dairy free with sago and milky matcha green tea with sago  all were excellent  the waitress waited to see if i liked he matcha because she warned that its not very sweet and said she could make it sweeter if i preferred but im a matcha monster and this was exactly what i was looking for     next up they brought out a couple of small appetizers for us to share in celebration of their opening  spring roll tempura shrimp and a dry garlic rib  all were excellent with my 7 year old requesting more of each  we decided to share the dinner for 2 which came with spring rolls chicken fried rice 2 bowls of soup won ton and hot  sour were both decent and 2 entree choices  we selected honey pepper shrimp divine and sliced szechuan beef   both of the mains were good and flavourful with a good amount of sauce  everyone in our group noted that the use of onions was pretty heavy and more peppers corn carrots etc would be nice  id say the dishes were at about 13 white onions  usually this is a deal breaker for me but the sauces and meat quality were superb   next up was our never ending sampling of dim sum  pork buns  499 good but smaller than most my daughter didnt care for them here  and neither did gramma not sure why  sticky rice excellent but it only comes with 2 small leaves for 499  this could be vastly improved by adding a 3rd one for that price or putting more rice in each banana leaf  literally the banana leaves had less than 12 of the amount of rice you would have at jumbo   beef skewers  not as pictured and not up to snuff in my opinion for 499 for 2  green onion cake  499 a standard that my kids will insist on every visit though i prefer mine to be a little crunchier  pan fried meat dumplings  499 standard but they dont bring red wine vinegar or whatever that sauce is most dim sum places serve with it  curried squid  499 excellent and tender but i would love the sauce to be a bit thicker and more plentiful to pour all over my rice   wed order 80 of the food again and to be able to have dim sum in st albert any day of the week at any time we will most definitely be returning here    even if mom and dad want regular chinese food the kids in our house will jump for joy at sticky rice green onion cakes and bubble tea  service was friendly but slow tonight with our dishes coming as much as 60 minutes apart  yikes  but i wont fault them on this as they work out their bugs hopefully in the future we will get things like rice before the rest of the meal  cheers wok house cant wait to come back  ps they deliver too","2598":"the next best thing to princes on the south side of nashville cleaner compared to princes just doesnt stay open as late","2600":"make sure you make a reservation especially for weekend brunch it gets packed we had to wait for an extra 1520 minutes despite making a reservation and arriving early so this slightly dampened the experience   food however was incredible i had a dish that was like a stew of vegetables with eggs on top and almost licked my bowl clean   great brunch spot that i would recommend to friends and family if they can get a table","2601":"best walmart on the southside nice location if youre looking for a southside walmart this is the one to visit  produce tends to be good and fresh because they move a high volume the produce selection is not great for unusual stuff but the basics are fresh","2606":"class todays lesson is on the compare and contrast paragraph  the sb farmers market is where people actually seem to shop and buy things whereas the berkeley farmers market is really too expensive and you just go there to be seen  the sb farmers market has great musicians  in contrast the berkeley markets musicians must know someone at the ecology center its operator  the sb farmers market is big while the one at berkeley is small  the sb market has parking amazingly whereas the berkeley one doesnt  the sb market doesnt have small eats yet the berkeley one does  the sb market has lots of lovely flowers while the berkeley market seems to have a smaller selection  if you visit sb the farmers market is definitely worth a visit  if you visit berkeley go to the berkeley bowl","2611":"in town for the weekend i was headed to starbucks and saw northwest as i was driving by im glad i stopped there the house blend coffee was excellent very  flavorful and smooth blend didnt need to to add anything to make it taste better as i would have done at starbucks the staff was very friendly and helpful","2618":"awesome cafe  my friends and i were in town for mardi gras in 2011 and stumbled upon this gem while wandering around looking for lunch  i had the fleur de lis panini and it was delicious  also the bathroom is ridiculously nice it had a tv playing amc","2641":"good beer  really good beer  nice people  clean  no food but they do food trucks some nights  doesnt help day drinkers they did offer up menus of places that deliver  this place is a keeper","2646":"i was on my way to pho  beyond with my mom when i was like hey do you want to try la fusion instead so we gave it a shot i gave it a 4 star for one reason crispy duck it was phenomenal i asked for both sauces thai curry  raspberry sauce on the side  i definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together the duck was seriously cooked to perfection   we also had the shrimp pad thai  it was okay  it wasnt great but it wasnt bad its pad thai   i think the 18 price is a bit much for pad thai   the decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant i saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special  but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option  its all good though   cons i think its a bit overpriced given its location if we were in the city it would make sense but not at willow grove   lack of parking  maybe like 6 or 7 spots we parked at the pho  beyond shopping complex  and walked over i think they should add another door near the back of their restaurant just a suggestion  if they have a deal with the bank to park therethey should have a clear huge sign that parking is allowed at the bank after a certain time   i dont know if it is lack of parking the weekday or the  but it was really empty inside the restaurant at 7 pm on a wednesday night it was a bit awkward   the olive garden across the street was overflowing with people waiting outside it was just awkward maybe they should have a groupon deal or something so more people can come to this place   would i go back again i think for the crispy duck  yes  edit i received a message from a fellow yelper that on the saturday they went there was a 3045 minute wait since i loved the crispy duck so much ive decided to have my birthday dinner there will keep you posted","2647":"ive been here a handful of times now and each time has been fun for the most part with our most recent visit being the most awesome night ever this place is huge since im not a regular i often get turned around when in there and have no idea where im going haha  the slots are fun i enjoy the video slots the most the interactivity is fun some of the slots are confusing i have no idea what im doing i just push a button the losing and winning back and forth can keep you there for a while you keep playing in hopes of hitting the jackpot lol i can see how people can get addicted ive been lucky enough to win a nice chunk of change a couple of times and thankfully i know when to stop myself i havent played at any of the tables yet ive never seen any low minimum tables not sure if they have those here  the staff at the casino in all of my encounters have been friendly professional and helpful we had an awesome time inside the hard rock cafe for a private event the staff kept everything very organized i have yet to eat at any of the restaurants here but am dying to visit council oak and grey salt one day soon","2657":"ok sooooooooooooooooo im not a chicken eater as a result this review will be about the service on the 1st day of opening  signs provided a countdown to the opening i found this to be a plus no need to stalk the building you know anywho on opening day in the drive thru i found the cashiers to be efficient friendly speaking to my 11month old niece timely   swift in their transactions i placed two separate food orders one for my granny  my sister   pricing was fair you can get a whole meal   drink for less than 7 one of those 3 chicken fingers deals thats cool ive become so accustomed to 10 for fast food meals until i was pleasantly surprised at this event   the lemonade is very tasty   since i only got a sip of my sisters i vowed to return for my own   as stated the drive thru line moved rather swiftly considering this was the 1st day i was impressed   only thing i wouldve liked to see was the store set a little more off the street because the drive thru line hung out into the street making passing as i exited a very difficult feat   glad its here in the area adds to the community in many ways","2660":"im going to get the complaints out of the way first  this place is very small i think it seats about 35 if they seated a few less the place wouldnt be cramped as much we literally had someones back almost at our table i could move two inches to my right and my face was in her hair her hair smelled very nice if they would have seated us by the door i would have been upset because it was so cold out and every time the door opens no matter where you sit you can feel it   the soda here is ridiculously priced it comes in 8 oz bottles and are 3 a piece i wouldnt have minded paying that had the prices of the food been slightly lower as i feel everything is just a bit overpriced the portions sizes are slightly small  now that is out of the way the food here is amazing there wasnt any salt or pepper on the table and at first this annoyed me so much as i love peppery food i ordered the tortellini soup and thought i was going to be disappointed because i was without pepper and it was spectacular i have never had a soup so tasty   i had a hard time finding anything on the menu that jumped out and said order me the pasta dishes are in two sizes small and larger the entreesproteins were sooooo expensive and nothing screamed out to me order me i wound up ordering the rigatoni with eggplant it was amazing the gravysauce that accompanied the pasta was delicious   someone at my table ordered the gnocchi these were not your typical gnocchi these were cheesy i have never had better gnocchi if we return here i would love to order this plate my husband ordered the pork chop it was the special he said it was really good i did try it and it was very flavorful another ordered the ribeye this was the only thing i didnt try at our table but he was extremely happy   the service here was top notch our waiter had a great personality and spoke very well he really did his job well he was probably one best waiters i have ever sat with cant remember his name      this place really deserves 5 stars for the food i only give it 4 stars because of the price and cramped feel   to give you an idea how how expensive there were 4 of us the bill came to 184  i was the only one who did not order 3 courses including tip it came out to be about 55 a head and i only had soup and a pasta dish fifty five dollars for soup and pasta is a lot  wed probably go again but it would be for a special occasion","2661":"oh my when we said we were going to franklin my friends younger daughter asked us to stop by this candy shop for her favorite  and they had some super tasty stuff loved the self serve jars they had cute displays for easter when i was there  and i was able to buy bulk spree which i am never allowed to do again and some old school satellites like communion wafers filled with candy and some fancy chocolates  really cute addition to the area","2668":"we visited village bakehouse after reading the reviews and were very happy we did the place has such a homey feel but small we waited a few minutes for a table but were occupied looking at all the goodies the breakfast prices are very reasonable under 5 for many items pecan sticky bun was amazing","2670":"oh first off it smells delicious  secondly it tastes delicious  we didnt know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts too which we ended up not being disappointed about   they probably didnt tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more who knows   i ordered sweet garlic wings the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch and we shared in order to try different flavors they were both scrumptious but i preferred my sweet garlic and the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense   we also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy   anyway gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good itll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5","2672":"they only take cash  so we took our ice cream addict for a pre dinner treat and picked up a delightful tray of flavors and creams  i had the raspberry sherbet  stars  it was bland an unsweet but i guess that is my fault for coming to a creamery and ordering sherbet  our cream addict devoured five favors for 5 dollars with sprinkles  she was in ice cream heaven as she drooled the flavors down her lips  it was delightful watching how much she was enjoying the cold delight  my other companion enjoyed the cone and unfortunately had to cover the tab because i wasnt carrying cash  i guess its not that big of a problem being that its right next to a chase banking branch   but its 2015 who doesnt take credit card these days  parking is also finicy as many of the the streets are under construction and i dont know how they feel about you parking in the strip mall across the street","2675":"these are the best donuts around a lot of variety at a great price the only downfall is the location but i deal with it for these donuts the hot glazed donuts are amazing","2682":"friendly service nice little pastries and doughnuts i go there for the day old french bread to make bread pudding","2690":"delicious bagels its a bagel shop so im not looking for pancakes bacon sausage or eggs if you want a breakfast platter go elsewhere if you want good bagels with butter cream cheese or plainthis is your spot cinnamon raisin and everything bagels are really good","2691":"i should never eat here seriously it is so bad to eat donuts the kicker is you can see them make them and what makes them so unhealthy and taste so darn good   krispy kreme is a chain obviously and known for its hot donuts made fresh in store they certainly live up to the name they are krispy and kremey    i adore the good ole traditional glazed although i have been told the red velvet out during holiday season is delicious   the staff is incredibly friendly and always welcoming   if i indulge in enjoying a sinful donut i typically opt for shipleys or foxs to support local business and they taste amazing but if i were near krispy kreme and had the craving i wouldnt pass it up","2693":"i am now a every week shopper we made a change in our diets and this is the easest way we can shop other than reading every single label in a store it is pricey but we have learned to really look at the prices and have found that there is plenty of ways to cut bying the whole foods brand really helps everything is good here the people are always friendly","2696":"another stop in the desperately hip district of edgehill  much like the other places of business in the area edgehill studios pushes its postmodern architecture and ultratrendy atmosphere on its customers  however because the sandwiches are affordable and because its so conducive to laptopers i had to give the place a star more than my gut wanted me to  they make a decent cup of coffee and prices and selection are similar to places like portland brew and bongo java  apparently they dont serve soup through the summer a bit of a bummer since i am a year round soup junkie but their selection is fairly diverse for such a small cafe  edgehill studios cafe has more room than i expected and it typically isnt too busy so its an alright spot to duck in and do some web surfing  the staff is quick and friendly and its usually pretty quiet  i havent visited the actual studio or been on an evening with live music but i imagine it is pretty par for a coffee shopvenue  i deem edgehill cafe worthy of your business but i just cant quite make it a regular stop  ill stick to portland brew","2703":"went with a friend for some free breakfast burritos  i got the egg and chorizo version without potatoes  added some medium salsa and ranchera sauce  on the whole it was a delicious breakfast  the eggs were nice and fluffy while the chorizo had a kick to it and the medium salsa lent a green aspect to each bite  i must say the chorizo was just a bit oily  i was sad they didnt strain it a tad better  the tortilla was also just a touch on the too chewy side  still though i enjoyed the whole thing  service was also really nice and i enjoyed the lady behind the counter  she was very chipper for 730 in the morning which i appreciated","2714":"yum yum yum ive only been twice but its enough to stick in my memory and cause me to argue for a visit every time im in town culpeppers for dinner then ted drewes for dessert  im a happy man ive never seen them without lines 6 deep and thats with 6 or 8 windows operating still they move quickly and prices are amazingly good so its definitely worth it ted drewes has been a local fixture for so long that youll see 3 generations of people hanging around eating and chatting  theres no seating so its either standing or sitting on the hoodtrunk of your car with that many people milling around parking can be challenging  the frozen custard itself is amazing delicious and as smooth and rich as the highestquality ice cream youve ever had a large range of excellent toppings and mixins are available i thought my tart cherry and hot fudge cardinal sin was good until i tried my dads raspberry if he hadnt turned his back on me and walked away  after my one bite he might not have gotten any more we could share it we could i guess ol dads not so dumb after all","2715":"great neighborhood restaurant  we tried the fried catfish stuffed with crab redfish on the half shell gumbo stuffed mushrooms pork chop bbq shrimp and tuna stack  i would definitely recommend the bbq shrimp the sauce was excellent and tuna stack for something on the lighter side","2716":"its been a while since ive come to this la colombe but it hit the spot on a chilly evening after a day of exploring the space is warm with a decent scattering of tables and benches in a cozy space right on the edge of cramped but not quite there i got a hot chocolate with almond milk which was on point  very chocolate forward without being too sweet my friend got their classic drip coffee a dark roast with milk and was pleased with the quality we couldnt resist a bit of something sweet so split a canele  a cylindershaped french pastry with a deeply caramelized exterior and a surprisingly light and lemony interior it was my first and it was a worthy indulgence  there is no posted menu so the ordering can be a little confusing but the baristas are knowledgeable and even gave me tastes of their different drip options to help me decide  ive also seen this place quite crowded with laptop squatters as well as people meeting with friends  probably because its right off of rittenhouse square  so we lucked out in finding a spot","2718":"this is my friendly neighborhood coffee shop so i may be a little biased but there are definitely some pros and cons to share pros the baristas are great i can only think of 23 out of 25 situations that werent great energy is great easy to feel comfortable whether youre getting some alone time or meeting with folks  indoor and outdoor community tables are fantastic the food and pastries are wellmade make sure you try the raspberryricotta scone  best ever great noncoffee beverage options which can be rare cons not too many outlets for laptop use not a huge deal but there have been a few times ive come with business to do and had to leave the method they use to brew coffee can leave some hefty silt that makes coffee thick and sometimes bitter were splitting hairs now  just get the americano instead its great there have been a few times my food has taken a while so its good to set yourself and others up for success by not being in a rush honestly a few minor things notwithstanding i really love this place i love what they do for my neighborhood i couldnt be more grateful that i live a block away","2721":"this expansive shopping center located right off charlotte pike will satisfy even the most picky asian shopper apart from the typical frozen dumplings and mountains of sriracha the store offers everything from mexican spices to indian frozen roti and chinese desserts the aisles are pretty well organized though the frozen food section is a bit lacking i noticed some patrons also had difficulty navigating through the large amount of items the store organizes based on ethnicity but not in any particular alphanumeric order of the many i saw there were specific aisles for chinese korean thai and vietnamese food i was pretty impressed by their fresh produce section covering about a third of the store and the extensive live fish selection along the entire back of the restaurant  this will probably be my staple shopping area for specific ingredients keep in mind they only accept card for purchases above 300 they also were unpacking large shipments of frozen goods when i went in the early afternoon so be careful to navigate around the cardboard maze if you catch them at that time","2727":"what a charming vineyard nj really does have some fabulous wines we visited here yesterday and and had the 10 sampler tasting all wines were good we bought 2 bottles of sangiovese reserve and merlot the vineyard is beautiful and ill definitely go back","2728":"heres why i like chipotle 1 its pretty speedy as long as the line isnt long  2 its got very modern decor 3 the prices are moderately reasonable 4 you can eat by yourself and not look like a schmuck 5 the barbacoa here s whats not so great 1 the dining area is messy 2 the drink nonalcoholicselection is dissapointing 3 the location","2731":"the cafe au lait is good the beignets are awesome what more can you ask for definitely a place to try when coming to nola to visit","2733":"yay as california expats weve been looking for reputable latin food if i see another place who sells only refried beans im gonna scream great selection of rices proteins and accompaniments plus jarritos mandarin praise the food gods","2735":"love the flavors and attention to detail but the parking situation is confusing and prices are a bit high for street tacos","2738":"i drove all the way from brandon just for some bbq the ribs are to die for and you cant go wrong with 5 for 10 bbq sandwiches definitely worth driving cross town for","2740":"a new modern barrestaurant has made it to the mundane town of marana  this bar does an extremely good job at doing what it has set out to do provide customers with a fun and exciting upscale bar atmosphere with a great beer selection and good food  come here and expect just this  upon entering one is greeted pleasantly is presented a menu and is informed of the counter service  the beers on tap are extensive ranging from a porter to a light pomegranate beer  to top it off all of the beers are local  after placing the order it arrives in a timely fashion  the wings arrived first and presented attractively and were some of the best wings in the northern tucson area even better than the ritz carltons core  the wings were plump cooked to perfection and smothered in a sublime hot sauce  after the wings the burgers arrived with the french fries both pleasant to the eyes  after the first bite i knew i would be coming back to dm brewery again  the high quality burger was cooked very well with the correct ratio of toppings  to top it off it was burger and beer night for 10  every night dm brewery has some sort of special deal going on  they also have a good modern rewards program using an iphoneandroid app  this is a great place to go with friends if your looking for a fun modern upscale atmosphere","2743":"the customer service was great only rating this place 45 stars because the pita was a bit hard which made it difficult to chew and the setting was a bit crowded which they obviously cant help but a nice thing is they deliver or you can get pick up the smoothie was soo good also you can tell falafel sandwich had fresh ingredients and the portion definitely met the cost i would order from here again","2751":"a really good ice creamery with a million unique flavors and the ability to order 4 or 6 small scoops so you can try a bunch i was pretty full walking in but still managed to eat 4 scoops and liked them all the ice cream itself is maybe not quite the super gourmet vibe of jenis or salt and straw but it was all very good and there are lots of cool flavors to try","2752":"really solid beer selection  us canadian belgian european  canned beer seems to be a point of pride in their offerings which is good because theyre near the philadelphia folk festival which has a no glass policy also pff has a no alcohol policy but  samples available always passing along the new knowledge and stocking the latest  goes out of their way to get good stock of beers offered in limited season","2755":"im a big fan of this place  its a fun sports grill with a tv in view from each seat  their wings a great their burgers are delish and who doesnt love crinkle fries  ive been several times including lunch today and the service is always good  the prices are very impressive especially for brentwood  my burger and fries were under 8","2757":"cute place a bit off the beaten path  and as a bonus there was no metered parking in front  the service was great and my iced mocha was excellent so much better than starbucks actually  my only complaint is that it was busy not a bad thing for the shop though and that space was at a premium","2761":"did you know canned goods here are often cheaper than in chain grocery stores in edmonton i like to buy amys products because their can linings do not contain bpe and all the other toxic stuff and the prices here are less than the chain store on sale  the deli regularly serves gluten free options for lunch  organic produce  no it might not be local but its usually affordable  organic mandarins i got a case for a great price  they were ripe and ready to eat  not like the ones from the chain store that are a real hit or miss  it is a smaller location than the main store on whyte ave but i generally find pretty much everything i shop for here  dishwasher detergent pucks gluten free flour heck i even got a straw cleaning brush  if you cant find something or in a hurry like me staff can point you to where you should find it sometimes i come between shipments and theyre out of stock but its never something so critical i cant come back another time  bring your own bag  its the best thing to do  they can provide you with a bag if you really want one  bicycle parking  yes yes there is  street parking well it can be hit or miss depending if you have to pay because of the arena events  check the meter before you walk away  it will tell you if you need to pay  its tough enough in the core and unfortunate that the city cant give them a couple of free 15 minute express stopping spots during event nights  oh and free wifi  ask the staff for the password","2763":"good solid pho here in goleta always a fan the place i go when im in the area","2764":" so were the type of people who will drive far out for cuz some chef moved out west  we did this for the i heart mr sushi guy yoshis and now weve done it for kenji formerly of sekisui on grand but actually izakaya ren is abooout the same distance so its ok  i have to say it was worth it  we came on a slow sunday they juuuust opened what 2 weeks ago to a strip mall and walked inside to see a pretty small eating establishment which made us wonder about their customer turnover rate  we just ordered all over from the skewers a chop chae salad kenji and this korean guy wokrae cho are coowners grilled fish neck and sushi  they were all delicious  in particular i liked the pork belly wrapped asparagus skewer  it wasnt seasoned making me think of sam gap sal  it was gosh darned tasty    the chop chae salad was potato glass noodles with greens and a spicy chili oil vinaigrette thing that was pretty good    the sushi  this is what we really came for  the fish was about room temperature and was just meltinyour mouth quality  you know how hard it is to find a place that has a decent yellowtail roll with green onion  its absurd  i really hope they hold their standards to this high a bar  finally the hamachi kama was fresh moist and delicious  it wasnt precured or anything though  it was just plain simple fresh fish neck that sat on the grill undisturbed    the only gripe i had was that the skewers were pretty expensive for their size which averaged a bit over 2 bucks apiece  i dont know if they have a happy hour but i will likely steer clear of that part of the menu otherwise  we found ourselves easily dropping more than 20 bucks a person for this place but that was simply because we felt the need to try all our staples  all in all we will definitely be coming back again  if you like plain old fashioned japanese food with a little mix of korean this is the place to try","2771":"nice authentic mexican  we went for lunch and it was not busy as all  ordered an enchilada and the skirt steak started with the table side guacamole  the pomegranate margaritas are yummmmmyyy","2772":"this was delicious i ordered a sushi burrito with crab mix and tempura shrimp cakes carrots and spicy mayo with seaweed wrapper for 11 and it was so tasty they make the rolls and burritos with what you want chipotle style the downside is that they definitely didnt have unagi eel which is what i truly wanted \u00af\u30c4\u00af oh well it really is just like a giant sushi roll thats not sliced but for convenience sake it does the job dont forget your prawn crisps theyre the best will definitely be coming here regularly","2782":"the bartender michael the house made spirits and beer and the great food a ruben and a depot burger saved the day  they were severely understaffed at 2pm on a saturday but michael was busting his butt and that made the situation all the more tolerable  we will definitely be back again hopefully the staffing issue was a one off    ps dont miss the opportunity to try the bbq sauce they serve with the sweet potato fries   as my my husband said its stupid good  unfortunately they didnt have a gallon to sell me","2786":"we eat here pretty much everytime we go to tarpon springs  the staff is always very nice and the gyros are amazing  their pita bread is just the best","2792":"summer is here time to cool off    my barista friend turned me on to machiattos long ago so when mine arrived in a 12 oz cup i thought maybe this place is not the best for coffee  its a really good value because made nice and strong however was missing the artistic value found at crema etc    before i received the drink i helped myself to some lemon ice water and began to notice the natural oak wood complete with knots and organic shapes  there are  lots of tiny wooden countertops with flowers some bartops with stools a bench area plenty of sitting chairs and a long metal table with parson chairs   i ended up in the parson chair and it was real comfy my derriere is in heaven right now  the espresso im drinking with a little foam on top is not bitter and very strong they probably make consistently good pulls for lattes and the like  they offer teas and lemonades for the hot weather  speaking of which this place is air conditioned and in a nice part of town surrounded by cool little boutiques an excellent spot for a relaxing summer afternoon","2793":"best hummus ive ever had  this place is delicious so glad i decided to try it my only complaint why 4 stars instead of 5 is that its a little expensive for what it is other than that great place the creamsicle protein shake is awesome as well","2794":"this is our favorite pizza in carmel  and that is saying something because there are many many pizza places in the carmelwestfield area  the pizza is excellent with many topping choices and specialty pizzas to choose from  the topperstix are simply addictive  late night delivery is available and that is a very good thing    we have ordered pizza here for carryout several times  while there were service issues the first few times it has greatly improved and i am pleased to report that the past few times service has been excellent  employees are super friendly and helpful    we are looking forward to trying more menu items in the future","2799":"the atmosphere and food were both good i had the sweet potato hash and it was delicious i wish the portion size had been a bit bigger but it was tasty nonetheless","2802":"my green curry was wonderful and filling  went for lunch with a friend as shed been before and loved it  our server was really sweet  and attentive  the only thing i wasnt crazy about was cash only but its printed prominently on the menu before you order  server helped me quickly find an atm plans to go back are definitely in my future","2807":"the food was out standing i got the petra mixed grill with rice and hummus first off best hummus ever rice was flavorful and yummy i have to say i like the beef the best out of the three meats the lamb was good but i like a whole cut if lamb more then the ground lamb then chicken flavor was also vary good and i loved the garlic sauce the place was very clean and the staff was very nice  the wait for the food is longer then i thought but its worth it there cooking your meal back there not just plating it the stuffed grape leaves also very good","2808":"good authentic mexican foodcant go wrong here","2809":"the experience is seriously hampered by the limited seating if you need to sit next to an overweight person which would seem to describe all their regulars you will pretty much need to turn sideways  the red beans and rice were superb  lots of andouille and a perfect ration of rice to beans and gravy  also has the crispy mac and cheese which the sign said contained crawfish but was apparently out of date  they change the dish every week and dont seem to care to update the simple computerprinted sign   food is prepped to order and arrives piping hot  mac and cheese was lightly breaded and deep fried which might explain the girth of the regulars   in all very authentic nolastyle cuisine and friendly and efficient service  it would have been more pleasant with a table and without a dozen people behind us eyeing our seats","2810":"new brewery beers are hit or miss but better than i expected for the first few tries  small but has a nice feel and very clean cut crowded but its just opened probably a good sign  ipas better than expected will come back to check out new beers as they grow welcome addition to haddonfield","2814":"a solid b to b i tried the falafel plate which came with rice and a small salad as well as a few slices of pita bread the falafel had a nice subtle flavor not overpowering but definitely not bland i tend to prefer my falafels inside consistency a little less dense if thats the right description but it was a nice flavor and a good cook for a nice crunchy outside the rice was cooked perfectly i cant stand an overlooked mushy rice but didnt have a whole lot of flavor it was light and refreshing but not spectacular the drizzle over the top tahini laban was a nice addition overall very nice food a solid bb","2815":"not bad steak and ribs were great chili cuo also but noisy shouty kinda place ya know yee haw anyway beer served in 22 oz is a favorite size with me but was disappointed when they did not honor the advertized 299 22 oz bubba beer beer every day all day posted on a board at the entrance huh cmon i didnt fuss paid full price for my beer kinda deceptive still id go back  oh grilled pork was seasoned well with the right spice buy waaaay too salty wont order that again","2819":"went here not realizing we had been to the west hartford location in ct until the very end of our meal  p  this location is way better than the ct location  in fact we would not have gone back if we had realized it was the same place beforehand so we were glad we had forgotten  staff was friendly and came by the table often    the table side guac was really great except ill say light salt next timeit was too much for me but i rarely use salt in my food so for most people it would probably be perfect  red sangria was good  my husband had the frozen margarita on the happy hour menu and enjoyed itbut be warned its strong  i wouldve been knocked on my butt if i had one  p  i got the fish tacos but instead of breaded and fried i asked for it grilled  it was really good  they could really invest in those taco holders though bc all the juices made the tortillas totally soggy and i had to ask for more on the side  flavor was really awesome though  my husband got the chicken tacos  came on a hot skillet  they were great  i tried them and they had a great flavor  the churros arechurros  nothing special but a nice little treat  there were some great sounding items on the menu but we just really went for a light meal so well be back again to try more dishes  oh fantastic happy hour menu  they have a good variety of choices for both food and drink","2827":"visited last year when i first moved into town  owners are very friendly and personally seated us  its an older diner but the staff were very friendly and the food was good","2828":"a girlfriend and i stopped by this adorable cupcake shop after eating lunch today she raved about how good they are and so i bought four for my family  i had the dark chocolate with chocolate sprinkles the icing was so delicious the cake was nice and moistim just not a cake person now if the cake part had some dark chocolate chips incorporated in the cake then id be a huge fan  the decor is fun and its in hip 12 south sprinkles even has a cupcake atm for after hourspretty cool","2832":"tastes like most froyo but the staff is extremely nice and do not give you the stink eye after your 6th sampling of the froyo i still prefer phileo yogurt on south street which has more flavors","2834":"you can rarely beat wincos prices  you just cant  the staff is all personable and hard working  are you going to find your roasted garlic and tomato with a dash of whatever hummus  probaby not  but you are going to find your staple foods and supplies  i love the bulk bins for spices  sunday afternoons and monday evenings are the worst time to shop and can be pretty frustrating  also monday seems to be when they are the lowest on stock  bring your own bags and you get 10 cents back per back it all adds up right  pro tip  their pizza dough and sauces back by the cheeses is a great cheap way to make your own pizza at home  pro tip 2 when youre leaving to go to your car check out the great view of mt rose  some of the most picturesque sunsets in reno ive caught on my way out of winco","2835":"what chain can you go to and  be asked what can i do to make your visit exceptional   this has happened both visits at this location that was my server  halfway through  the meal the manager  comes around and stops  actually stops at your table and asks if the meal has met your expetations again both times at this location working at chains is hard business and yet these friendly attentive people go beyond in the effort category  now the foodeggs done perfectly bacon to write home about buttered toast what seemed like homemade hashbrowns at the very least they did not taste like they were out of a box  coffee just perfect","2838":"the pizza was good a reasonably priced i also had dairy free cheese put on my pizza and you couldnt even tell the difference my only thing is that the pizzas are soooooooooooooo thin and i am definitely not a thin crust kind of person other than that it was very nice","2839":"i saw this place on a pbs special on vietnamese food in new orleans i stopped in for take out lunch today pork banh mis and pho delicious the bread was perfectly flaky the prices were very reasonable employees friendly and the food was prepared very quickly i live in the neighborhood and imagine myself coming back at least once a week highly recommend","2840":"edgehill cafe is located on edgehill between music a row and 12 south in a quaint little area called edgehill village   they have a wide variety of hot and cold drinks that you order at the counter and receive at a separate window im not sure how they get the order from the counter to the window but i suspect they use either paper digital transmission or they turn around and tell the barista what to prepare and ive missed it every time because im trying to figure out how much youre supposed to tip on a 248 coffee   their prices lean on the side of pretentious for a coffee shop but i do like going there and its very conveniently located between where i live and work   the staff is nice i can usually find a table they have a really cool round table in the corner that people must camp out to get in the morning because seriously theres always someone sitting there its always a girl like stressing out about a final she should have been more prepared for too   i had breakfast there once i found it to be worthy of them having a menu whereas some coffee shops make the food more of an add on and less of a specialty i enjoy their small plates like the cucumber goat cheese and honey plate because who can even get through the day without a healthy little treat like that   and thats what it boils down to we all need a little treat sometime when its 3 pm and you know you cant lift another finger until you get a little treat in your system you deserve it","2845":"this is becoming a great option for sushi at lunch time ive been a couple of times with a few coworkers the service has always been quick and efficient its a modern and clean environment i like to sit in the booths facing towards the escalators its just interesting to watch the reaction of people on the second level as theyre looking down at the action on the conveyor belt   i typically order my sushi favorites instead of waiting for them to come around on the conveyor belt my favorite so far is the dragon roll its perfect if you like salmon i also get the lower priced salmon skin roll that gives me 8 pieces of yumminess for lunch thats all i need ive had the unlimited miso soup as well its a little heavy on the spring onion but it has a great taste you cant go wrong with any of these items its all quite filling theyve recently added more items to the menu they have many nonsushi items to pick from as well  it all looks tempting  i can see the urge to grab other eyecatching plates as they go by your table you can definitely be in trouble if youre one of those people who eats with their eyes try to visit on a monday you get more bang for the buck on blue monday i can see why this concept has become so popular im a big fan of it im so glad that yo sushi chose tampa to be one of their us locations it fits in very well at international plaza","2860":"great place to start your day with fresh pastries and percolated coffee everything is made to order and the chef is always there prices are almost too good but thats not a complaint its become part of my day would be fun to see it get a bit more busy but no doubt it will with the food coffee price combination they have going","2864":"i came here for the world cup finals so i kind of figure that i had a different experience than normal  that being said i really enjoyed this spot having recently relocated to central indiana and i loved this bar they had a great beer selection i wasnt quite sure what i wanted and my waiter offered up options to meet my wants he was so knowledgable and led me in the right direction his name was shawn and he seemed like a beer master  we also ordered the cheese and gravy chips cheese fries are never a bad idea they were amazing and according to the menu theyre doctor recommended so go for it","2870":"firehouse is one of my go to places this new location  is right near my house the staff here is friendly and doesnt rush you even if they are busy i like all of their toasty subs so i cant recommend just one if youre tired of the boring subs from from subway you should give firehouse a try you will love it and this new location","2871":"we went for happy hour as part of yelp drinks week and sat on the porch which is their designated smoking areait was too nice to sit inside after a few sips i did not even notice the smoke  i had the traditional bratwurst stuffed pretzel and a mexican mule tequila ginger beer and lime served in a pewter mugfirst time for both and i enjoyed them waitress was cute and friendly the only thing i would like to see added is some happy hour specials on food i wish i lived or worked closer but then again it is probably good that i will need to drive a bit to get to the tequila","2886":"just ordered delivery and it was very good  i had a roll combo with cali spicy tuna and salmon avocado  the salmon avocado was my favorite of the three  i would definitely recommend to anyone in the tampa area  and if the swiss cake is available you should absolutely order it  also the delivery was quite fast","2887":"we tested this place out all due to the santa barbara axxess card membership  we all decided on the brew sampler tray and it didnt disappoint well return aging for sure","2889":"beer garden review if you are looking for a casual evening with some beer and your basic pizza and fries this is it the pizza has better crust than lariele they have created a great cozy outdoor environment in the beer garden i just wish they had more draft beers and more pizza options but hopefully those are coming the service was not great waitress seemed annoyed and took a while to come back to table the arancini was eh you are served with plastic plates and forks so definitely a casual setting","2891":"i first came here based on a friends recommendation for lunch i was super excited to eat a gyros sandwich and check out this local cafe that somehow had slipped my eye all these years when i first went in i was fully geared up to order the gyros sandwich but then i saw the menu and spent a good 5 minutes debating whether or not i should change my mind the manager i think was really patient and offered up some recommendations and i ended up getting a pita melt with turkey instead this would just give me an excuse to come back another time to try the gyros  the pita was great and immediately made me a repeat customer as i came back a few days later i love how the restaurant is run by a family and how friendly and talkative they are every time im here the place is never really crowded as i think most people come here to grab food to go but its nice to have the option to eat in  on days that i wanted to trick myself into thinking i was eating healthier i would order a gyros salad which provided the satisfaction of eating a gyro but with significantly more veggies  i love blackberry cafe especially since it falls in line with my goal of supporting local dining locales the service and friendliness also really helps just expect a brief wait for your food as they prep it when you order so everything comes out fresh also the parking can be a problem since blackberry cafe shares a small metered lot with three other places but this should not deter you from stopping in and grabbing a delicious meal","2892":"hadnt been here for several years   we were pleasantly surprised   crab corn chowder is very good as is the seafood gumbo   very good quality seafood and very good preparation   good portions and reasonable prices   service was very good   well be back","2900":"how i wish i could give zeppoli five stars  the food hands down is sublime  the one word to describe the experience  fresh  we ordered the vongole which could have been the best clams and macaroni i ever ate  my swordfish was the best   and every time i took i bite i uttered these words oh my god  this is fabulous  my husband and i both agreed that zeppoli was a treasure  for the food  unfortunately are two areas are in need of serious attention  i understand from the reviews the noise level is an issue  first thing i said to my husband when i sat down  it is so noisy in here  this is a serious problem when you cannot hear the person next to you  cozy is one thing  incredibly loud that it took away from the experience is something else  i think the later you make a reservation the better it is but that did not help the service  the other area for me that was a negative was the amount of time it took for us to eat  it was a thursday night and yes it was packed  however three hours for a dinner for two and waiting 30 minutes for bread and another 30 minutes once our dessert was finished and wine had been gone was way too much  when servers take notice and see that you have no wine your dessert has been finished a while ago there is nothing for you to do because your backs are hurting from sitting so long they could lose the uberchill vibe and ask if you are ready for your check  only three tables remained and still took a long time to get to the table  in the beginning once the wine was poured it took 30 minutes to get a menu and another large amount of time for bread  the wait staff were nice however inattentive  laid back is the vibe i got but they were so laid back we thought they simply forgot about us  i get that the experience is not rushed and you are supposed to feel as if you are in someones home but the wait and the noise took away from the delicious food    i really hope both the staff and the noise level could be corrected  the food is unbelievable  i made a point to rave to joey baldino about his food and did not mention any negatives  we are still talking about the food but my husbands back hurts from sitting so long  gotta be up for this type of experience  next time ill bring a back pillow   there will be a next time as i am hoping this was a onenight glitch","2907":"if youre looking for fresh spins on the classic burger this place is for you huge fan of the firequacker and the onion rings oh and did i mention their milkshakes are incredibleeee the service is quick and the food is fresh every time this place is fire","2909":"we made a pit stop to see a friend in philly on a road trip from boston to baltimore we couldnt decide on what we wanted to eat because my girlfriend was in the mood for ice cream while i was craving a cheeseburger lucky for us our friend knew about this place that could satisfy us both simultaneously  rating breakdown  22 stars for taste  i got the cowboy burger served rare the patty was meaty thick and grilled perfectly with just the right amount of pink inside the bbq meat juice that had dripped onto my plate was promptly sopped up with the amazing crispy shoestring fries that came with the burger desserts were good the pistachio and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream were delicious i wasnt terribly impressed with the apple brown betty because it was a bit more apple than i would like but if you are a fan of such things it was warm sweet and moist  very satisfying in my belly on a rainy day  11stars for value  most burgers and entrees were around 10 and came with a side of fries however large plates can also cost upward of 15 trespassing into a nono zone for me personally desserts were 4 each but come in decentsized portions that make them worth trying you wont leave this place hungry for sure generous portions ensure you leave here stuffed  11 stars for customer service  the wait staff here was definitely very hipster  wearing colored jeans or cutoff jean shorts which i found endearing our waitress was very friendly we had been in the car for over 5 hours so we were guzzling water with no abandon she made sure our glasses were always full even if it meant coming back every 5 minutes or so also one of my pet peeves is waiting forever for the check  receipt the waitress sensed we were in a hurry and came back promptly after i gave her my card  no bonus star because even though the food was good it wasnt anything terribly special for the price there are definitely other places id be more willing to drop 10 at in philly however if youre in the area and in the mood for both burgers and ice cream this is good place to stop by","2910":"came here for dinner but the wait was 2hrs long so we sat at the bar soooo glad we did firstly jason is the best bartender he recommended the shrimp n grits for dinner lets just say it wasnt only orgasmic because the flavor just explodes in your mouth it tastes homemade and makes you feel happy inside you also need to try the baked oyester for appetizer i can die happy ill give this place 4 stars cuz of jason and his amazing recommendation and the ambiance at the bar tip him well","2915":"the restaurants been open for about 2 years and i just noticed it when i was craving barbecue  i went in and was empty i had doubts but ordered beef brisket and ribs  the beef brisket was amazing loved the sauce  the ribs were good meat fell off the bone  they also have 10 plus different sauces you can put in cups and bring to your table  came hungary and left happy ","2916":"ideal la forma como la espera a las afueras del local se compesa con visitas cortas a las tiendas alrededor antes de una notificaci\u00f3n por sms   la atenci\u00f3n un tanto impersonal pero la comida vale la pena ahora los precios no reflejan la realidad se paga un premium por la fama","2918":"great gelato in stl i had the salted caramel chocolate dark chocolate which comes with bits of chocolate with salt and pistachio   they were all amazingly delicious the ambience and decor to the place is definitely a huge plus too great as a after dinner hangout place to satisfy that sweet craving","2919":"very laid back atmosphere very friendly staff and excellent food one of my favorite places for an inexpensive lowkey dinner out","2924":"i have only eatten whole foods takeout area foods  and have no complaints the store is very clean the checkers are friendly during high traffic times its hard to find a table and if you do its dirty but thats because it gets very busy there i would do my shopping there but its too expensive for me","2927":"the tour was great bob was funny and kept hubby  i entertained   we stop at 4 different places  oceana for seafood gumbo vics for muffaleta the gumbo pot  for jambalaya  tujagues bar for brisket poboy  i got my tickets thru groupon which i recommend  the food was okish best place was oceana  overall its a great tour and i recommend to do it at the start of your trip that way you can go back  try the restaurant you liked best we will definitely be returning to oceana  also if you do return to 2 of the restaurants you get a discount for mentioning you were on the tour  thank you bob we had an awesome time  one suggestion a dessert stop to end the tour would be great","2930":"the flavours are all authentic and the service offered is both friendly and efficient  those of you who enjoy wonton soup would do well to know that the authentic version served here features kelp  kelp isnt everyones cup of tea  i know that i dont care for it at all  but thats the way the soup comes out of the kitchen  recommended","2938":"it was whispered this was some of the best ice cream out there i can not dispute this fact  i splurged and got myself a single scoop of mint chip the scoop was huge i mean huge the flavor was delicious and it was so creamy it was a delight in my mouth  i also ordered a large cappuccino while it wasnt the perfect cuppa it was a decent cup of rich java and thats just what i wanted with my ice cream i would reccomend this place to anyone","2939":"this is the bakery i usually go to in chinatown  they have a decent variety of buns and pastries  red beanfilled buns mung beanfilled buns coconut stuff egg tarts etc  if you buy a dozen they will give you two more for free  the prices are standard for a chinese bakery with most things at approximately 1  the service has always been good  they do serve coffee and tea  there are a couple of tables inside with usually the expected group of older chinese guys chillin in the corner table debating about something  great place to stock up on the buns which i usually do before leaving town","2950":"fantastic breakfast spot  i went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times but both times the food was excellent  the first time the line was 10 deep and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order  it might have been because she kept screwing it up  my rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on sunday they werent serving hash browns only grits i opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well  great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal   best practice walk in to the back counter order your meal and then grab a seat  no wait staff  they offer up great bloody marys for those in need a little hair of the dog  i say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to  unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of even when still when your food comes out go and enjoy","2955":"had a fantastic birthday dinner at besito last night with my husband atmosphere is beautiful upscale and romantic which was exactly what i was looking for the food was quite good my husband got the camarones ajillo and loved it i mean loved it so much he destroyed the entire dish even though he was stuffed i had the enchiladas suizas which was also good might try something else next time though i didnt enjoy it as immensely as my husband enjoyed his meal but no complaints   their salsa is great but unfortunately we werent wowed by the tableside guac which made me a little sad because i love me some tableside guac but it was okay we got the medium spicyness so maybe we should have gotten the spicy and might have enjoyed it more no matter it didnt take much away from the evening my sangria was top notch and after our meal they even brought me out a slice of tres leches cake my favorite how did they know with a little candle in it my husband didnt tell them it was my birthday so they must actually read the comments you put when you do an online reservation since i wrote that it was my birthday dinner i thought that was very nice of them to do so  thanks besito we will definitely be back although probably only for special occasions because it is a bit pricey our total for both our entrees tableside guac a dos equis amber one glass of sangria and tip was a little over 80","2957":"afreakinmazing did you try the chicken and waffles they brought a whole new meaning to that sht and their pho and their spring rolls and everything everything here is awesome when im in the area i make sure to stop by and enjoy some of their deliciousness","2962":"i stopped in last night for a quick bite to eat and really liked the atmosphere i went with a half order for the signature wings which i highly recommend they were fantastic i also had a side of their chips which im sad to say were a bit of a disappointment they definitely seemed homemade but not very fresh i dont know if it was timing or if they are always that way but i wouldve picked a different side i imagine they would be amazing freshly made","2966":"awesome take out bbq  and the aroma is mouthwatering as you drive by their smoker and smoke shack  heading north on us 41 in lutz   you simply cannot pass it by  they offer reasonably priced take out for sandwiches ribs etc  you can also buy the bbq cooked meat sides and sauce  you may want to stop in and check with them to set up a pick up date if it is a really large order but i have been able to get 20 sandwiches worth on a drop in  i tend to be careful with shredded bbq because of the fat you can have inadvertently included but whaleys consistently has excellent quality lean meat with terrific flavor and sauce   its a must so be sure to stop by","2967":"i love to explore local small businesses and this one was a great find its a very nice small cozy and super clean neighborhood coffee and crepe restaurant staff is very friendly and their crepes are amazing i tried the honey bee which was good with mochachino the prices are pretty affordable it wasnt super busy on a saturday morning","2968":"basically come here for all of my gas needs and sometimes grab the occasional sandwich if i want something quick and easy but during rush hour the gas pumps are packed though","2969":"second time trying don day korean restaurant but i feel that i should be eating here more often the food is awesome and they have a very relaxed easy going vibe there are cool wooden table booths to sit at and kpop music videos playing in the background that and i like how the restaurant is tucked away in a random little spot you gotta know about the good spots ya dig   banchan  you only get two side dishes eye roll at edmonton and their weak banchan selection which was kim chi and seasoned seaweed the seaweed was so delicious we had to get refills three more times  spicy seafood soup 16 3499  spicy seafood soup with vegetables and udon noodles these korean hot pot dishes are so satisfying i love how you can just keep on eating and eating but by the end it looks like you havent made even the slightest dent in it the soup was nicely spiced the noodles had the right bite and the balance of seafood to vegetables was pretty reasonable it was a very filling satisfying and comforting meal  don day is definitely a hidden gem im surprised actually that its not more popular i guess there are quite a few korean restaurants in the same vicinity dont let that deter you don day is a great spot for some authentic korean eats","2977":"delicious avocado toast the bread used for the toast is whole grain and really really tasty solid cold brew cool staff and cool vibe inside","2982":"im a big fan of exotic meats  went to bareburger two days in a row  first time i had a wild boar burger the wiki  good sprouted wheat bun  it was dressed with pineapple relish and duck bacon  meat was a bit underdone even though cooked medium  delicious burger overall and very good sweet potato fries  second day i had a buildyourown elk burger with blue cheese and alfalfa sprouts with a side kale salad  again meat was undercooked   i ordered the hemp milk bun a gluten free option  good flavored bun but dry and crumbly  i think toasting of this bun is not needed  going back today for a third visit  i plan on a goat burger  stay tuned","2985":"weve tried most of the chinese restaurants in the havertown area  this is the one id recommend  consistently good food fair prices and pleasant service","2986":"my wife and i decided to have lunch the other day at granite city  we thought the restaurant atmosphere and decorrating was very warm and  relaxing  the staff was attentive and quite helpful  we each had one of their regularly featured brews and were pleased with both  the menu has variety but not so much that you would fear non fresh ingrediants  since it was lunch we went with a sandwich and a burger  my wifes chicken salad was good but nothing teribbly unusual  which you might expect from chicken salad  i had the napa valley burger  the menu description made the burger sound very interesting  angus burger with an avacado spread cheese mixed field greens in a balsamic dressing with sliced sundried tomatos  the burger was cooked to my liking and was well seasoned  there an number of what would be considered upscale burger places in the nashville area that dont seem to know how to season ground beef and charge plenty more than granite city  my only complaint is thatas it turns out the balsamic dressing in combination with the sundried tomatos over powered the delicate flavor of the avacado  additionally the the chewy texture of the sundried tomatos fought with the tenderness of the ground beef  next time i will ask them to skip the tomatos  we will return to try other menu items  all in all it was good experience","2987":"ordered a green hurricane smoothie that was delicious and the mediterranean chicken with zoodles zoodles were delicious and flavorful and the chicken was a bit small but very tasty shared a salad as well that was absolutely huge and delicious with apples and beets felt full without the guilt great prices and cute set up","2998":"what a gem this place saved my vacationliterally  my fiances family has a beach home in carpenteria where we have been staying for our very first vacation since having our 8 month son needless to say it has been a much needed vacation thats why when i got a nasty cold over labor day weekend i was determined to speed up the healing process so i could enjoy the rest of my stay being from los angeles we have our pick of health food stores on every corner and all i can say is it was a pleasant surprise to walk into pacific health foods and see products of the highest quality in health and nutrition   while waiting to pay i heard another customer speaking to an employee  i believe a family owner who was extremely knowledgeable about the ins and outs of eating to fight disease if you are suffering from anything or know someone who is i would recommend going in and picking her brain   i have been every day to get a veggie juice and a shot of wheatgrass my fiance loved their mango smoothie and the green acai bowl was a yummyhealthy lunch alternative when everyone else was cooking up burgers they also offer local coldpressed veggie juice which unlike noncold pressed holds the nutrients longer allowing me to take it home to drink later and fight off my cold   i got sick on the 2nd and today is the 5th i woke up this morning feeling amazing  thanks pacific health foods you have a good thing going","2999":"a  casual and relaxing eatery in center city philly with big windows that offer great people watching   a friend recommended this place for something goodquick and casual we started off with chicken rice soap which was blistering hot and tasted freshly prepared though it was surprisingly absent of rice despite not having any rice it was a tasty satisfying soup and chock full of fresh veggies and shredded chicken  my friend had the buffalo wings and they were an excellent version of this dish the chicken had nice crisp coating and juicy tender meat the sauce was tangy and spicy but not overly so it sauce was just right and a very good rendition of buffalo wings   i had the roasted turkey club which was a decent to good sandwich prepared with good fresh ingredients the turkey was moist and flavorful and the accompaniments on sandwich were wellbalanced and tasty though the sandwich couldve used a bit more chutney and mustard  we were too stuffed to have dessert even though our friend recommended this as the highlight of the restaurant   service was warmaccommodating and friendly   recommended for a quick bite if you are in the area and not looking for anything too fancy or expensive","3001":"so many options i dont know what to choose  i definitely thought my friends and i were the oldest people in the joint you know following the school of 3 year old birthday parties ordering before us the line went quickly and was worth it  a small scoop will run you about 3 and they give you plenty i ordered the  black and yellow crunch which has chicory that thing in cafe du monde coffee which was awesome it was really hard to not go with my gut and get a standard flavor but im pleased i did the red velet was outstanding and i tasted the oatmeal chip cookie which was good for a bite would probably be too much in a cone  they have an array of double chocolate sweets all the way on the far left but those are too chocolatey for me so i stayed away  i wish this place had more outdoor seating","3012":"this store is so convenient for when you forget to buy stupid things like flour sugar basic fruits and veggies basically anything except for meat and poultry  very cheap i have happily walked out with three bags full of ten dollars worth of groceries  tips bring quarters if you want to use a cart bring your own bags","3015":"came here for lunch today and got a chicken parm sandwich the portions are huge for only 67 dollars a nice easy chewable soft bread fresh mozzarella cheese and two breaded chicken breast the chicken taste a bit bland but over a nice size lunch   this is the first time i been here and this place is packed with varies of food you got fresh made italian food that ready to be cooked theres a variety of coffees alcohol and a bakery i wanted a cannoli but the lunch crowd got big real fast","3018":"i visited the french press on my most recent trip to santa barbara it was a pleasant establishment compounded with the pleasant company of those i was with and those at the tables around us it was very comfortable the tea i got was fantastic but its hard to go wrong with tea i enjoyed the art on the walls a specific piece with a masked face that i couldnt dare take my eyes off of i was intrigued perhaps easily intrigued also ill be back","3021":"i went here not expecting much because the other reviews werent too good i thought the staff was very friendly the cashier and another lady that helped me were both very nice to deal with the food was good and both of my togo orders were accurate i do think the portions are a bit small for the price but thats not this individual locations fault i would definitely return to this location again","3024":"dear brewpub  you are my goto place for vegetarian comfort food in indianapolis but somebody has to tell you your beer is bad this news best come from someone who loves you from an old friend so here i am trying to break the news gently after being tempted by the siren song of 3 pints last night   but lets be frank now you need to do something about your beer because you are a brewpub supposedly but your housemade beer sucks its flat it has no body for those folks out there who have thought that maybe brewpubs beer tasted bad because your unsophisticated palette was unable to appreciate the complexity of this craft beer that is not the case its just not good beer now that we have sun king and upland and peoples brewing tasty beer in the central region of the hoosier state brewpub your mediocre suds are unacceptable   i love your spinach melt your garden sloppy joe your salad dressings the sauce on your ravioli you have an enjoyable atmosphere and nice outdoor seating right off the monon so please just fix this one thing   with love from your fan emily","3026":"im excited to be the first one to review this new cupcake shop in glenside i drove past here last week and saw the sign and thoughta cupcakeryin glensidedangerously close to my home  so i stopped in the cupcakes are delicious i tend to try cupcakes wherever i go and theres something about these cupcakes that makes me want to come back for more so far ive sampled the very vanilla the frosting melts in your mouth toasted pineapple coconut fresh pineapple on top the salted carmel and the chocolate  vanilla   its in a very unassuming shop on a stretch of limekiln pike its very easy to miss its a small place that just sells cupcakes i hope this business does well as ive enjoyed myself every time ive stopped by while it doesnt win the award of the best cupcake ive ever had its definitely the best cupcake this area of montco hands down","3038":"i like the ambience and the attitude of the staff i shared a meat pizza with my husband but skipped the chicken as that isnt what we  prefer we were offered the opportunity to add an additional item bit chose not to  the pizza came out very hot and the quality of the toppings were very good service was attentive and made sure we were satisfied with the meal the crust was a thick style edge but the main portion of the pizza was thin underneath and crispy very satisfying  i consider myself a pizza aficionado and rate this among the best i have had in a long time  it just wasnt very special as it cooled off but that is to be expected   overall a fine little shop with good tunes being played it was a nice meal all the way around","3043":"great beers and cool atmosphere they recently finished their outdoor patio and it looks spectacular you can sit outside in any weather and stay warm their food is also really good i recommend the beer bread with the oatmeal stout beer they make a tasty sloppy joe sandwich a huge blt and a good blackened catfish their beer tour is more informative than the anheuser busch beer tour although it is not quite as long the only negative is that the food isnt cheap but it is made with local sources and is definitely worth the price   this is one of the spots where we bring outoftown friends they always like it bottleworks earns an a","3044":"surprisingly delicious as this cypriot place goes all in with the greek font on their menus i had always wanted to try this spot as it seems philly is lacking in quality greekmediterranean the kofta was incredible case closed","3048":"most of the cupcake favors are goodkoo koo for coconut and the peanut butter chocolate one are my favorites super cute shop though and customer service is fine  great for special occasions","3054":"im a big subway fan typically i dont think of chains as often being more then 3 star worthy but the staff here is friendly the place is always clean and they load your sandwich up with the toppings just a good subway franchise","3055":"my roommates and i came in here for dinner this past friday and we were all pleasantly surprised about how good it was we had never been there before and were all thought that is was going to be over priced with little to show for it we all left very full and agreed we would go there again  the quality of the fish was good and the service was good too","3056":"i end up here frequently on nights when i feel like going out but havent bothered making plans ahead of time   the food is uniformly good  always fresh fish which is really the only thing that matters at a sushi joint the standard menu has all the basics but little more than that the daily special rolls though tend to be excellent and they will customize them to your taste if you dont want roe spicy sauce whatever  service is friendly and efficient the decor is attractive and the vibe is lowkey plates are reasonably priced but probably a smidge higher than id like to pay otherwise id be here more often  solid thumbs up","3059":"im gonna say this is the closest to being korean chicken wings in stlouis the raddish used to b free and now its not so thats why i lowered it by one but overall good wings place","3060":"stopped in a couple weeks ago food was great close to perfect grilled cheese  soups were hearty and delicious  i especially liked the new hope fountain soda local all natural and great flavors  cant wait to stop in again","3063":"ate here when visiting the clearwater area  our greek friends took us and we let them do all of the ordering for the table  items ordered included saganaki flaming cheese taramosolata greek caviar greek salad broiled octopus and a 35 lb fresh snapper  we also had greek wine and several deserts from the attached bakery  the place is huge and you really feel as if you are in greece with the blue and white decor    the taramosolata was arguably one of the best things i have eaten recently  i had never had it and we actually ordered a second order  i definitely recommend it  other than that the food was very good but not outstanding  i have been to greece before  the saganaki was not as good as weve had at other places stateside namely detroits greektown the broiled octopus was cooked to the right texture but it could have used some  spices  it was just sitting in olive oil with lemon wedges on the side  the fish was superbly fresh and cooked well but when ordering a whole expensive fish i usually expect the waiter to serve it and help with the bone removal    also i hesitate to say it but we were not blown away with our bakery selections  the one exception was the baklava which was outstanding    overall great place to go with friends or a group  you will occasionally hear singing for a party and find yourself shouting opa","3066":"hipster central  honestly i mostly go here for the people watching and chai  they have definitely found a niche market in edmonton the chai teas are their signature drinks but they also serve alcoholic beverages kombucha and other fizzy drinks  food wise their chana masala wrap and samosas are my favourites great dishes to share when you want an afternoon snack  even with the renovations the venue fills up fast i would recommend scoping out a table while you are waiting in line bringing a friend and having a strategy is always the best way to go   you also may be waiting for your food or drink for awhile but it is all a part of the experience just keep a look out and listen for the orders","3072":"came for lunch and had to say that despite the loud music the food atmosphere and location are great  the food was in particular outstanding  we started with their daily special  baby octopi in a sesame aoili  delicious tender bright red baby octopi with a sumptious taste of raw octopi and sesame oil  then we had the sashimi sampler off the regular menu i must say we quite enjoyed the grilled squid tako salmon something else my coworker enjoyed and some very delicious white fish with a fantastic taste and texture we didnt recognize    we had the special maki roll  tuna  tobiko inside crab outside  delicious  they did not skimp on the tuna nor the real crab meat  hmmm then we finished with a small plate of sushi which i must say was outstanding  the fish tasted and felt fresh tender  moist  the accompanying spicy tuna roll was very very good more tuna with a light kick than the standard unrecognizable super spicy mostly sauce spicy tuna you find at some places  im not a fan of spicy anything roll because of this but izumi definitely put spicy tuna rolls back on my mind","3074":"my mother and i share a love for organic hippie food  the buffet at essene is so good that she requests to come here for a meal every time we go fabric shopping on 4th street  in fact during the week leading up to our lunchfabric shopping date its all she can talk or think about  they must be putting addictive substances in the tempeh","3076":"great little store for the tree hugger in all of us stopped by here today in search of a particular product and saw many intriguing items in the aisles i will return to taste the seitan cheesesteak wrap for certain friendly and helpful employees too ","3088":"great coffee house they have cold coffee and cold latte on tap not a gimmick really good stuff get the black and tan no sugar added and feel good about your choice of caffeination","3089":"well size isnt everything  i ordered the grill is on fire veggie burger  i was practically starving  when it arrived my first thought was oh dear im going to have to order two  the veggie patty is tasty  the texture is a little on the homogenous side but il not offputting  i was pleasantly surprised that my burger plus sharing a larger order of fries made me full  the sauces for the fries were interesting  i enjoyed the sweet hot mustard  a good bloody mary was my adult beverage of choice  the drink was well balanced and came with a swizzle of sriracha sauce on a spear of olives and citrus  service was great  shakes looked really good but i refrained from indulging  id definitely recommend a stop here if youre in downtown stl","3090":"theyve got some good tea really nice vibe free wifi a book swap shelf and its very spacious if i were a student id camp out here its quiet and doesnt suffer the same fate as other coffee shops in there area there is plenty of room to sit and spread your shit out  i think ill swing in from time to time to have a post work tea you know for the days where i dont need that post work drink","3095":"before i moved a year ago i never lived near a rallys now im hard pressed not to visit more often  the people at this location are always friendly thats a big plus especially with fastfood  my favourites are the big chicken sandwich and the fries the chicken sandwich is quite cheap for both the quantity and quality of what youre getting and the fries rallys fries are just perfectly seasoned awesomeness in a cup  best friendly polite employees quality food  worst on one visit they accidentally got a chickennugget into an order of fries it wouldnt have been a problem except they were my girlfriends fries and she was eating while driving and she didnt realize until it was in her mouth and shes a vegetarian so she was nauseous and didnt eat the rest of her fries which was a score for me but yeah that did cost a star because now she doesnt want to go there as much","3100":"my friend recommended this place i was scared it was going to be a tourist trap due to the location prices were high but it was well worth it we came about 1115am 15 minutes after opening we couldve sat inside and gotten seated right away but instead we waited for an outside table to clear which took about 30 minutes my wife and i shared the following fried seafood platter scallops and uni oysters everything was great but the scallops and uni on top were the highlight i would definitely come back here and splurge some more by getting a crab  but its just so hard to crack and eat haha","3103":"we did the sunday night prefix menu and it was delicious ample quantity and good value serive here is always excellent and friendly","3104":"oh my yum these donuts were delicious and it was a fun atmosphere i got the margarita donut since it was cinco de mayo and my husband got a mexican hot chocolate donut the filling in the margarita donut was a little too tart for me but the hubby really enjoyed it we shared i would love to visit again and try some of the other creative donuts available","3107":"update great lunch deal 2 slices and a drink with refills  cheese fries have melted mozzarella yum  trying to be conscientious i order the grilled vegetables so good grilled eggplant squash etc then i start helping myself to my friends cheese fries next time we get a double order  the price is right for the pizza special you just cant find a better pizzadrink deal 600 versus my grilled veggies 1100 plus my drink 250   oh i forgot to mention lulus happy hour starts at noon who knew long for a liquid lunch if only","3110":"stepping into the wine bar is like stepping back in time  in an amazing way i stopped in here today with a friend for a glass of wine happy hour from 46 every day that means instead of a glass of malbec i got a half carafe for the same price the jazz on the radio the small normalsized wine glasses the bartender in vest with perfectly waxed mustache hardboiled eggs for sale i felt like i was in paris in the 1920s or is it rome my friend and i decided it was a 1920s fratalian place and fell in love with it ill definitely be going back","3114":"i was surprised on my last trip to philly that they have these shops now to make pretzel buying easier  pretzels were a great price and tasted just like i am used to  they have several dipping options and they even sell sandwhiches and other items besides just the pretzels","3116":"been a while since i had lunch here  today it was really good  thy had a roasted pepper and gouda soup that as fantastic and went well with the grillcheese i had","3117":"ive only been to this location a handful of times but it was a good experience every time   i came by today where i ate sushi for lunch and picked up some tea that was on sale they even had a tv in the food court where they were showing a live fight on wwe i thought that was cool   another thing i immediately noticed is that they brought in bigger shopping carts these new carts handled much better than the old ones   however they need to do a better job with their cleaning because there were flies buzzing around the food court","3119":"sinfully delicious    offering everything from mini bundtlettes to full bundt cakes this place will kill your diet and feed your inner child with icinglaced confectionary goodness   my mouth salivates when i think about it    nice selection of flavors that change by the season   the only thing i dont like is the fact that they make you remain on their mailing list to get your free birthday bundtlette   they tend to over email you so i cancelled the email subscription and found out that i was not eligible to have my birthday bundt anymore even though i come quite often    a bit pricey but with the extra dough","3125":"as far as atmosphere goes i much prefer the nicer weather so i can sit outsidethe inside is a bit dated but if the foods good which it is thats not really a factor  nice location by the monon trail which makes it a great stopping point when out for a bike ride  im not a vegetarian but their veggie options are outstandingin fact i order them more than their meatier options  make sure you order the veggie chipsthey are delicious and that includes the beets normally a beet would have me spitting it out in my napkin but not here  this may simply be testament to my belief that frying makes everything taste good but im going to give them the credit    all in all a great lowkey place to go get a meal with friends and linger","3126":"my meal was tre delish this is one of those places you might be inclined to overlook but you are missing a real treat for starters the price is reasonable i got the chicken with mushrooms and cognac sauce oh man it was good  the reason for four stars rather than five is that one of my table mates was not as satisfied as me he ordered the lasagna which was loaded in meat and fewer noodles than one might  expect with this dish one appetizer we got that i highly recommend is the bruschetta such a fresh starter for my meal  i ended with cheesecake great meal and super price we will definitely return","3127":"we had the pho rare beef spring rolls and bhanmi steak the price is affordable the servings generous the service quick the staff friendly and the food very good this is my favorite vietnamese restaurant in the greater santa barbara area","3134":"i went to their happy hour on a pleasant weekday afternoon and the outdoor patio was fantastic but  well obviously not in the summer because its too hot i went in the fall so the weather was still nice sit outside they have fantastic pizzas at an incredible happy hour price the pizzas are not in their regular menu so make sure you go during hh they also have a late night hh so check that out too great prices on drinks all about that hh i got champagne and rose and each for 5 bucks  great deal service was great but if youre outside and theyre really busy things might just a little slow service wise","3137":"we arrives promptly at 4pm when they opened the doors and were greeted by the ownerbartender  they only had 3 beers on tap of their own along with 2 ciders at 8 and 14 ibu respectively  we had 5oz pours of gose a 54 sour wheat beer with salt and coriander and a 46 weisse with guava passion fruit and guanabana  both were tasty for those who like a cider instead of a beer  in florida beer and cider cant be made at the same place so they have teamed up with someone else to make the cider  the german chocolate cake stout was good at 54 with coconut vanilla beans and cacao nibs  i had a red ale that rang in at 58 that was slightly bitter with notes of toffee and chocolate    there is no food at all but they are impeccably clean and tidy  i like the lighting see pics ive added  the bar top was also made from reclaimed wood from the original building    they have a bit to go to get the place moving but are definitely headed in the right direction  i was really impressed to hear them talking about collaboration beers one with b nektar meadery in michigan","3141":"this market is small but has all of the essentials covered in addition to some very tasty baked goods  some highlights from this year opened in may i think  daily loaf   organic flaxseeds and wholegrain flour  marliscious the pistachio torte cake is 3 fantastics layers of pistachio cake sandwiched between and enrobed in a pistachiofilled cream  i have not found a pistachio cake anywhere else and this is just delicious  the prinzregententorte is amazing to even look at with 8 layers of superthin sponge cake layered with chocolate cream and covered in a thin chocolate coating its very good and has just the right amount of sweetness  she doesnt always have every cake every time but you can always order a particular flavor     farm fromage creamy organic goat cheese  its delicious paired with a spring mix salad and glazed walnuts   frecon farms hard cider  need i say more   jimmies cupcake co james taylorboston cream cupcake with a custard filling vanilla cake and chocolate frosting  personally i just like the names  cupcakes taste pretty good too but arent as fantastic as house of cupcakes in pton   livengood family farm  grass fed ground sirloin  makes really good tender burgers   macdougalls irish victory cake you have to try the sweet butter cake  its rich buttery and full of simple delicious goodness  they have other varieties but this is the traditional triedandtrue and in my opinion the best  definitely stop by if you live in the area and dont feel like driving down to reading or ardmore for your farmers market goods  i only wish that they had more prepared foods and snacks like sandwiches and roasted meats","3144":"i painted my bedroom the color of their lavender honey flavor no joke that is the most beautiful shade of light purple ive ever seen    and do you know what it is called on a paint swatch at home depot naturally calm yeah thats pretty much the effect good ice cream has on me  you see i    unlike some people    do not scream for frozen yogurt  i scream for ice cream dammit   and this is the real deal    so rich and creamy that i usually cant finish the whole cup dont ask me what my favorite flavor is    it changes every time i go in but my favorite color will always be lavender honey ","3148":"stopped by this cute little cafe after i found it on yelp i was near the area and needed a quick place to relax before an event the space is long and narrow but ample seating and bright and airy the overall aesthetic is very pleasing the pastry case by the late afternoon wasnt super filled but there were enough options to choose from like the lemon tarte which was delicious the coffee menu itself is rather small i ordered a mocha which was definitely a more bitter chocolate which i didnt mind but if youre used to sweet like starbucks this may be a pass for you the people working here were nice the prices were a tad expensive for coffee and pastries especially when the coffee isnt super elaborate i also wish they would use real cups they might have these but they didnt bother to ask if my order was to go or not they offer bread for purchase as well the staff was nice the bathrooms clean overall a pretty great cafe in philly perfect for an afternoon pick me up","3149":"delicous and inexpensive i had a yummy cuban sandwich","3152":"nice small breakfast place run by a husband and wife who make tasty crepes for affordable prices pretty small menu but the crepes are worth a trip there","3166":"drinks 5 small amount but delish  app 5 empanadas r amazing  entree 4 too saucy  service 3 short and unfriendly","3167":"saw this while walking the mall and figured lets check it out  havent been to a sushi place like this since japan  we had some plum wine  delicious  and a few plates of sushi that were good  would like to go back and try some other dishes","3169":"this is an interesting place all of its coffee is from kcups but mine still tasted fine my issue is that it is so environmentally harmful however that aside this is a good place to make a quick stop for coffee or to buy in bulk the owner is very nice and helpful we had a great conversation i wish that there was seating so i could have stayed longer however the price is fantastic and i liked being able to customize the strength of my coffee","3176":"this is my neighborhood gelateria it is so cool i can say that   the gelato is really good my favorites include dulce de leche stracciatella marscapone lemon caramel and the test of any great gelato maker chocolate i have never had a bad flavor here and the staff are more than generous in letting you sample the flavors to make your decision you can mix 23 flavors depending on the size you get as well they also have solid coffeefu and make a mean espresso   it is also a really nice mellow space to hang out in with lots of dark wood and a pressed tin ceiling i am a total sucker for these i like to play boardgames there with friends there is a nice outdoor seating area now as well with a gate through which you can bring your canine companions to lounge with you or i suppose felines on a leash   a great dessert to follow a meal on south grand or just as a destination in itself plus it saves me from having to haul downtown and i can walk to it which is beyond awesome","3183":"really cute new burger joint kind of a rustic grey decor that sets the tone for its exotic array of beef elk boar and goat burgers i had the elk and it was fantastic","3189":"i had their strawberry crepes and the grindhouse freddo by far 10xs better than any starbucks coffee i will for sure be enjoying this again","3190":"we stopped in during a weeknight in mid april and it wasnt too crowded i had been there before on a weekend and it was packed the food was fresh and the pita tasted like they just made and was a nice side dish the bakery is right next door and had plenty of choices and we each picked a couple of different chocolate desserts and they were great ive been there twice and have been happy with both meals i wanted to try the flaming cheese maybe next visit opa","3192":"pretty decent place no real complaints they tend to forget on the side items so just check your bag other than that i will be back","3193":"i was craving for a lavender latte from the mud house but wasnt able to find a parking spot and was crunched on time i finally saw where whisk was located and there was plenty of parking so i decided to go in yes whisk is not too far from mud house but only had 8 mins to spare i wanted to try their popsicles but whenever i walked in and saw a lavender scone i totally forgot about them im so happy i stopped into whisk because omg their lavender scones are absolutely delicious i came here on a wednesday afternoonthe case was not full of goodies but just enough to pick a few  what i tried  strawberry whoopie pie i got this for my nephew it was good something with the cream its light and fluffy and not too sweet at all  salted caramel cupcake recommend by staff it was really good but way too super sweet one bite and i was done the icing is just way too rich for my tasting   bacon chocolate chip cookie another recommendation by staff i tasted bacon once throughout the entire cookie for some reason i dont think bacon in a cookie goes together something i didnt care for   lavender scone it was calling my name but i had to askif they were moist and not super dry the girl was right she told me it was buttery and not dry at all i hate dry scones but omg out of the world yummy if i didnt have the lavender scone im sure my rating would of been a 3 star lol but i was craving something lavender  i will be back to try other goodies especially the popsicles and scones   if you like lavender and scones you must have one from here","3198":"they are out of chicken and dumplings and mac and cheese we waited a bit and they came through","3208":"the chicken here kicks ass seriously ive never had such good fried chicken in my life crispy thick and crumbly coating outside juicy and not at all dry chicken absolutely stunning  you can choose from saucy or dry and theyre both totally awesome i recommend ordering half and half prices are reasonable and food quality is outstanding location is easy to find and convenient if youre on the south side  why the minus one star i called ahead to place a pickup order and still had to wait 15 minutes for it the staff apologized and chalked it up to being busy indeed there was about 6 other groups of people waiting for their chicken i didnt mind so much but listening to the grumbling of others as they complained about their wait i dont think they called in like i did i think they just walked in to order it sounded like some others were waiting much much longer  i will definitely go back maybe ill go at an offpeak hour and hopefully avoid a wait","3212":"very good food for very good prices i had their italian sub and while i wouldnt say it was the best ive ever had  it is a close 2nd","3215":"super yummy i found this place about two weeks before leaving nashville and i miss it so much amazing salads and sandwiches","3221":"so every now and then i have a big carb craving i mean a noholdsbarredpizza and breadsticks and cookies kind of carb craving if im gonna cheatthis is the place i want to cave to their meatball sub is sooo perfect nice broiled bread with just the right amount of gooey cheese on top of the meatballs nothing pretentiousjust a damn good sandwich my kids love their garlic knots and theyre a great price to grab and go without feeling like you paid a ton oh and do yourself a favorget the chocolate chip cookie dont skimpits only two bucks and the size of a dessert plate theyre  buttery and soft with a nice crunch on the outside youll thank me later rememberyou can always work it off at the gym","3225":"im in town for a conference and turned to yelp delivery for an easy inroom dinner this place looked good so we gave it a shot the ease of ordering was great interesting menu with a lot of choices our food was delivered to our door about 10 minutes before the projected delivery time the food was tasty but not out of this world the portions were rather small and one of the burgers was overcooked overall it was good though id eat it again but i wouldnt go out of my way for it","3228":"this is pretty straight forward frozen custard and historical route 66 roadside attraction a tasty treat well worth the quick stop","3233":"this place makes a good cup of coffee but you already new that i came here once on a date that ended up being late so i ordered a cup of joe and played a game of chess with a man named grey im pretty sure hes the checker at vons long story short i lost the game and the girl so i knocked off a star","3234":"i had the boiled gulf shrimp appetizer and the chicken with roasted vegetables entre everything was fresh and delicious the wait staff are attentive friendly and happy to fulfill any request they can i had a very enjoyable lunch even though i was unable to finish everything","3236":"this place is a real treat to have in the northwest delicious italian food inventive cocktails and a wonderful outdoor space overlooking kelly drive the chicken parm appetizer is a favorite a whole chicken leg and thigh and a delicious tangy marinara with cheese i will often get it with a salad as my entr\u00e9e i love that they have plenty of bicycle racks for their guests as well","3238":"after living in the area for a year i decided i would give bob evans a try even though its a chain restaurant the food was still pretty good i had the french toast and everything came just as described on the menu that also has a long list of potentially delicious ill have to come back items to choose from this place kind of reminded me of dennys but a little classier wait staff was attentive and the place was clean and well kept","3239":"if i had a chance to eat here for dinner i suspect i would upgrade cyranos to 5stars alas wed already eaten so our group of 9 only had coffee and a couple items from the extensive list of desserts which are large by the way plan to split them   the low lighting and redthemed decor was atmospheric but still provided plenty of light by which to see the service was also greatfriendly and quickespecially the stylish water server   cyranos is definitely on my shortlist of places to visit next time im in town  trivia the character of cyrano de bergerac was only loosely based on the real man a dramatist whos work included early spacefaring science fiction the real man was known somewhat for his love life look it up and a genus of damselfly is named after him","3240":"another saturday afternoon in the books and i can honestly say it ended up satisfactory primarily because of the meatball sub i received  it was pleasant to rub elbows with of the local college coeds as well when i was young and was at muhlenberg u we didnt have talent like that  anyhow i am getting side tracked pretty great feature about this place it has a great selfserve soda and condiment area i left with over 14 straws was pleasantly surprised to see both rc cola and birchbeer as soda options i panicked and got sprite  sandwich was really good 2nd best meatball sub i have had since i saw the toomey debate out by willow grove i saw a toomey debate and by pure luck a top notch subway close by  funny thing about that night was i lost my belt again so overall good times","3244":"ive been ordering from this place once a week since they opened since the penn kids went home the delivery has been lightning fast i am talking under 15 minutes on more than one occasion which is insane but im just glad to have a sushi delivery option in west philly mizu doesnt always delivery out to my block and theyre not on grubhub anyway  my only complaint is that i wish they would add noncrunchified spicy rolls to their menu but i always request without tempura crumbs and theyre happy to accommodate","3246":"im not sure i liked it as much as some of the other reviewers but was better than i expected this location has been a number of different things crown fried chicken but the service was friendly it was fast and the steak and roll was pretty good not as good as genos or steves imho but better than others like pats for instance the meat isnt ground up like you see in some places  not much inside in terms of furniture or places to sit so more of a take out spot they have some of the normal side items soda and chips but at least the day i went they were out of some things ie only had diet coke and not regular coke  bottom line i would give them another try if i am in the mood for a steak sandwich","3250":"my friend lives across the street from here so we always find ourselves stopping in to grab some beers and snacks very convenient and like that you can make your own 6packs they carry a large variety of beers yes you can easily spend a lot on beer here but i think its worth it given that theres no minmax so youre not limited to getting a 6 12 or 24 pack like you would be at the beer distributor and you dont have to commit to getting just one type of beer but can mix and match","3254":"this place is fantastic it is a onestop shop for all your italian needs everything is made fresh and it has such an original atmosphere just from walking in on the outside you feel like you are stepping into a different country only thing is that if you are going on a weekend be ready to wait a long time for your food but trust me it is worth the wait the staff is no nice and time goes by quickly i would suggest that if you are going there to get lunch order first then walk around and explore so you dont end up waiting around for too long of a time also be ready to be in cramped a little","3256":"very cool modern hipster gastro pub  micro brewery  its in what appears to be a historic building downtown  they have picnic seating outside with games like cornhole inside they have communal pub tables and a bar top private tables seem to be few  i found the food to be over thought yet underachieved  nonetheless i still enjoyed their fare well enough our server was friendly high energy and had a silly salty demeanor perfect for this type of environment  i really enjoyed my pale ale it was crisp and hoppy with a velvet texture not too thick great head  my friend had a raspberry ale that was great for her but in my opinion i found it sour however if youre into fruity craft beers this would be just right for you  definitely try this place  we came to get out of the casino and found it to be only a 7 min walk away from the silver legacy  i mean you can only do the buffet so many times  glad we came","3257":"love maverik and was very glad to see this location open up  it is very conveniently located near the 395 onofframp and the intersection with north virginia street  we stop here very often to fill up and as of yet its never terribly crowded at the pumps   the price of gas is always reasonable and if you have their adventure card you can receive a discount of 2 cents per gallon on gas which makes it an even better deal    the convenience store is well organized well stocked and staffed by friendly and helpful employees  great coffee for getting you going in the morning    when in need you cant go wrong with maverik","3258":"i ate at this restaurant last night monday which is 100 taco night the tacos are good for the price they also have margaritas on special this night if you plan to drink beer youre better off for the money getting the 800 32 ounce mug if you plan to dine on monday get there between 430 pm and 515 pm because its packed after that time they also have live music on monday enjoy","3262":"i ate here before my gluten free issues  i loved this place i had the sweet potato pancakes out of this world the best pancake i have ever eaten i also had the hash browns and sauase all tasty michelle our waitress was very helpfull we did not know what to order and she pointed out the sweet potato pancakes you have to eat here if you like pancakes its a must in nashville we arrived around 9 am i hear the lines are bad we had no line  visited november 2011","3265":"its going to get four stars three for the perfectly cooked delicious cheap lobster an extra star since we had great service and you get a bib all restaurants should have a bib option   if you want lobster this is the place for you they have 1 pound 2 pound 3 pound and any mix in between if youre coming for anything else or expect fantastic side choices this is not the place for you they  have  a fresh seafood counter with good prices   the fish dip must be delicious but they ran out insert sad face the soup was puddinglike but such high potential with fresh lobster piled on top of your mug of chowdah   although it says only beer and wine it looks like a full bar to me  good beer selection served in a bottle    if i want to eat lobster this is my place","3271":"the habit chain not a chain i dont care  all i do care about is this is a solid fresh tasting burger  not amazing not the best burger ive ever had but solid  someone complained about all of the references to innout but i think the comparison is completely appropriate  the style of burger is similar and it gives a person an idea of what kind of burger to expect  it is similar but in my opinion a little better  maybe because we of the weather or because there was a teriyaki burger option  had a bit of a regular char burger too and that was solid as well  but my onion rings were what was really good  crisp and you could actually eat it with the onion  the onion didnt come flying out the first bite like most onion rings  the berating on them was really good  i would also like to say how awesome it is that the habits burgers come with caramelized onions automatically  all burgers should  so yes i can make a much better burger at home but the habit makes a soli fresh tasting burger","3274":"great spot for all casual affairs  this location is perfect if you just want to grab a cup of great coffee to go or if you prefer to enjoy it inside  there is ample seating space to sip at your leisure  it is located within rittenhouse area so the parking will be tough i typically park a few blocks south and work my way up walking in the counter to order is right in front and then the seating area is towards the left inside its upscale but casual lots of tables and even small booths to get a group together for coffee and work many people seem to find this location ideal to open up their laptop and enjoy a good coffee   the coffee is what sells this place  great roasts with bold rich flavors as you walk in you can smell the amazing scents  and it tastes just as great as it smells  the workers are pretty friendly and the menu is lean so it doesnt get too confusing when putting in your order the feeling i got was that if i became a regular the baristas would definitely start knowing my name and my order it has that charm which is pretty endearing   overall definitely recommend this place and this brand of coffee  awesome stuff","3275":"overall a fun place to be played some slots and had dinner at the cafe there was live music but because of that you couldnt really talk at dinner food was mediocre though","3282":"i come to this baggins location at least once every two weeks i work down the road and the location is a nice 510 minute walk from my office although the lunch crowd can make a line out the door each weekday i still love it and always see about 5 others from my office so its an easy sell to get a walking partner  i have tried many things on the menu but my go to favorite is the unforgettable baggins sandwich i get the wholesome half which includes 1 side and a fountain drink with your half sandwich the whole sandwich is huge so this 7 deal is awesome for a quick grab and go lunch i enjoy the sesame pasta salad with it  you can also switch things up like adding cranberries or green chiles for another 45 cents many of their normal toppings can be added for free as well  i suggest that if you go there between 121 pm on a weekday you should call or order online ahead of time i like ordering online because you dont feel so rushed as when you call on the phone you can also see all of the extra toppings you can get which is nice if youre in the mood for experimenting  i just went there about an hour ago i ordered online and doublechecked my noavocado unforgettable im allergic tear and it did have it on there i brought it to the manager and she personally made me a new sandwich and gave me an extra cookie too for the inconvenience the manager can seem disgruntled during lunch time but ive been there enough that i know she is doing a great job and really keeps her employees in line to make things right and correct any mistakes  definitely check it out if youre in the neighborhood or if you have jury duty etc","3283":"5 mimosas to follow a new years eve hangover you had me at hello pub and kitchen is a very relaxed and easygoing hangout spot with good food to match the bf and i were both craving some red meat so we decided to try pk we were seated in the back little private dining room which is cozy with lots of small tables exposed brick and natural light the burger was cooked to my liking and they were very accommodating to some topping substitutions i loved the fries and the food the waiter was extremely cool   the only downside  and it had nothing to do with pk  was the fact that because of the mummers parade there seemed to be tons of loud families in what would usually not be a typical family establishment i love kids as much as the next gal but sometimes usually after a night of heavy drinking you just want to eat your burger and drink your alchy sans rugrats","3288":"good beer nice bartender would have given it a 5 if it had ac to hot in the mid of summer had to leave to soon but we will be back","3290":"just a quick review on the dessert spot we discovered this past weekend  i had heard good things about frost before and didnt know there was a location on oracle near where my wife and i do a lot of our tucson shopping  so when we had the opportunity to stop in we took advantage  the staff was helpful greeting us as we walked in and allowing us to sample freely until we made our decision  my wife went with a lemon gelato and i had a combination of black cherry and raspberry  all three flavors were excellent and we felt like it was a good value for the price  yes it is a bit more expensive than your typical scoop of ice cream but the quality reflects that price so we still feel like we got a good deal  the only knock i have is on their drinks  they have tea and cocoa listed on the menu but the person who rang us up admitted they dont serve them anymore and should take them off  i appreciated the honesty","3291":"i was told by a lady at work that this truck was the same as mexicali which ive heard great things about and have been meaning to try  in reality mexiphilly is not mexicali despite how similar they sound but its not bad  i was apprehensive because of the low rating on yelp  i decided to try it anyways since it featured vegetarian burritos similar to mexicali and i had been prepping myself for the sweet potato burrito ever since the morning when i realized all i had for lunch was a cupcake  i ordered the sweet potato burrito with the medium chipotle and hot habanero sauces as well as jalapenos  a lot of people around me in line ordered the sweet potato burrito as well so it seemed like the way to go  there were only a few orders before mine and i received my food in a little over 5 minutes  i didnt experience any confusion in the orders but probably because there werent that many people to keep track of  the woman who worked there was very nice and recommended that i put both sauces on my burrito good idea  my burrito was very enjoyable  to me burritos filled with things like sweet potato plantains eggplant and spinach were very novel and unexpected  i liked that it was toasted on the grill  the burrito came with both black and pinto beans and the sauces i had ordered  i thought the flavors of the fillings were great together but the burrito was not evenly distributed so half of it was delicious while the other half with only sweet potato and no sauce was not as flavorful and pretty mushy  my friend got the eggplant which was pretty good and contained a couple more veggie including celery  the burritos were a good size pleasantly filling but nowhere near food comainducing  good bang for your buck at 350 a burrito  this is probably more of a 35 but i think this food truck deserves more stars than it has gotten so im rounding up  maybe ill try mexicali in a bit and then will have to downgrade this one","3297":"yum tater tots on pizza late night delivery that came faster than promised friendly staff taking the order and a delivery guy who made me smile cant ask for much more thanks we wish we lived closer","3300":"never had a bad experience  we usually get carry out and the food is always ready when they say it will be","3306":"when im in tarpon springs this is my place yall   greek food is amazing unlike chinese food greek food hasnt been adapted very much to the american palate thats one thing i love about it ive eaten greek food in greece and with a few exceptions its pretty much the same everywhere what sets one greek restaurant apart from another are two things selection of food and qualitypreparation of ingredients  hellas is a very large restaurant they offer free parking behind the building a ticket your server gives you at the end of your meal im eating there anyway i get free parking while im at it in season the wait for a table can take a minute so be prepared the bakery is always mobbed so be ready for that at any time of year my only real issue with hellas is how close the tables are together its tight guys dont consider this place for heart to heart conversations  i love the menu here very traditional greek with a lot of items you dont see and many items you do normally see on my most recent visit we got the trio of spreads and i ordered a chicken souvlaki sandwich the trio of spreads is a lovely hummus perfect tzatziki and a feta spread my favorite with perfectly toasted pita triangles the chicken was really really good the ingredients were fresh and the sandwich was assembled so that many perfect bites were achievable   i took a slice of baklava cheesecake home and had it for dinner that was a good call","3308":"yes this certainly can be considered a tourist trap however i am still a fan just barely this is a large farm and country store that features various pick your own options depending on the season for the fall that means pumpkins and apples   my biggest qualm with this place is that there is no difference in price between pick your own or those items picked up in the store and you have to pay for a tractor ride out to the fields400 would it kill them to deduct the fee from your purchase anyway we did it for the experience and it was fun and from the children we encountered they were enjoying it too but at 79 a lb for pumpkins you would save mucho dinero by purchasing them from your local supermarket who most likely also buys them from this farm at much cheaper costs  while on the hayride you also have an option to pick apples again same cost inside the store and the apples on the tree are huge think of the  chocolate covered monsters you see at the holidays and you are getting close   the store boasts many varieties of baked goods from these we sampled a pumpkin blondie that was incredible there are also sandwiches salads snack foods and take home dinners to name just a few some of these food options are also available outside on busy weekend days you can tell that much thought has gone into maximizing commercial viability there are other activities for children here including a petting zoo corn maze and other farm like displays most of these activities carry fees also  overall i am thrilled that this farm is thriving places like this can connect us to the land and provide children with their first glimpses of where our food really comes from but i cant help but imagine that a generation ago this operation would not be so commercialized and i really hope that this trend does not continue to worsen because if it does it could exclude those who may appreciate and need it the most 4 pumpkin spiced yelps","3309":"omg  food coma  excellent prices and large helpings  im not going to rave about the food but we did leave quite satisfied for what it was  the price point is on point   ya dont need to spend much chedda to eat the chadda its an inexpensive decent meal i guess is the main bullet point im trying to make here   i had the monte cristo which was good and the chips and queso which i gobbled right up  the staff was very friendly and helpful","3313":"i am a very happy customer the food was absolutely delicious my only gripe is that they are closed sunday and monday please open up at least on sundays im sitting here starving lol","3314":"we were driving from la to san luis obispo with our 8 month old son and decided to stop in santa barbara for lunch  living in the midwest and missing the ocean we were craving seafood  i used my yelp app on my phone to find this spot  the location is great  at the end of a pier overlooking the pacific  the atmosphere is very casual and familyfriendly and parking is easy and can be validated  my main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh the majority of it was flown in from other locales mostly atlantic ocean  it just seemed so silly to eat seafood flown in while sitting next to the ocean  i had the crab sandwich not local crab and it was really delicious  my husband had the lobster from maine tacos and was disappointed  i tasted it as well and found that they werent terrible but all the seasoning and additions really took away from the great taste of lobster  service was good beers were good and the location is great so while i think this place is a solid 35 stars i will bump it up to 4  cant beat oceanfront dining","3315":"i believe they have new management now the produce section has vastly improved   no more gnats flying around rotting fruit and better dates on dairy eggs etc the store seems much cleaner now you can actually get to the milk refrigerator case there is no longer a table of products placed in the way that you have to trip over the bakery section is surprisingly good ive purchased a few cakes here and all have been fresh and delicious the employees behind the bake section counter are very nice and helpful thanks for not blasting bubble gum music over the speakers great job","3323":"i came here with a group of 2 gals after hearing some good reviews of their burger it wa sa beautiful day and we wanted an al fresco style happy hourdinner thing going on we came in sat down and decided on the cocktails and wine im not a crazy drink person but i enjoyed my cocktail on to the food though i settled for their burger which was definitely good meat was cooked to perfection and the addition of the bacon was just what made the burger pretty memorable i would say im a burger snob and i prefer burgers that arent bleeding and mooing rare but i dont want my burger tough enough to chuck it at someone well i like them medium rare and they were quite successful in that regard i would love to come back to try their bread since ive heard its one of the best around but it definitely is a must come back place","3332":"after two days of packing cold cut sandwiches for volunteer work lunches we found that zimmers was within 5 blocks of our gentilly work site so we decided to get po boys to go for ourselves the number of po boys togo probably overwhelmed zimmers when we ordered but it was well worth the wait we ordered a variety of po boys from fried catfish shrimp oyster veal and well as 12and12 sandwiches i had an excellent large fried catfish sandwich the first day that had 45 big catfish pieces on each half of the sandwich that i got 23 through  the rest made for a tasty nighttime snack later when i was working on my computer whenever i order fried seafood po boys i doctor up mine with ketchup and hot sauce which adds a little extra kick  the next day i ordered a small fried shrimp sandwich that was generously stuffed with shrimp and was delicious all too many places that fry food do not change their frying oil often enough but this is not the case at zimmers zimmers is a great find and worth seeking out","3333":"ive come here almost on a weekly basis for the past few years to watch soccer an excellent place to watch a match there is not place that can compare outside of the downtown location the food ranges from decent to delicious im certain that the pizza here is the best in the area by far","3335":"pretty decent acai bowls they were a little sweet for my taste and could have been better with fruit on top but otherwise they were good i got the dragon bowl and my friend got the kale acai bowl just a warning hers was much sweeter than mine because it had froyo and guava juice in the mix this breakfast was a muchneeded break from nashvilles comfort food and kept us refreshed for a while","3348":"just stated trying this place a few weeks ago and i enjoy the food and prompt service the sauces here is the star and there are plenty of combination available in term of food choice i end up getting the same thing but sooner or later ill start to try other things for side dishes the new balsamic tomatoes are excellent","3349":"i love this grocery store the staff is polite but some times the parking is a pia they have great salad and hot bar bakery sushi bulk items and produce my suggestion is to keep an eye on the prices some things are way crazy expensive and others are super cheap always try to get the 365 brand even there big bag of cat food is just 2 bucks","3357":"this was my third visit to the this place yet it was the first time my burger was even slightly interesting it was more than that it was great i always wanted this place to be awesome but every burger i ordered was under seasoned and bland not to mention the high price you pay upwards of 10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you dont get a side with it now im willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch which i believe theirs is and when the flavor is amazing which it hadnt been until yesterday so maybe its time for me to give this place another try  i have actually always been a fan of their fries their house made sauces and their onion rings   their ice cream was never really my favorite i really prefer a creamier ice cream and i feel theirs is on the ice side however i think ive come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that its just different my favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream i got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well  annoyances worth mentioning  the service ive always had servers with decent attitudes but theyve never been terribly attentive i always feel like im looking around for them and waiting for them to come back i dont know if theyre understaffed  the noise this place is super echoey and super loud it made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation   parking its not easy or cheap  community seating ive been at the community table two out of my three visits both times i was lucky enough not be sat right next to strangers but its still nit my favorite style of seating  over all i know im going to go back to this place especially since i finally found a burger worth paying for","3359":"the monsier croquenut is delicious there are some really good donut options here and the hours and operation keeps expanding","3371":"this place blew me away its set up like an outdoor bazaar but its all inside many different cultures came together and make for a fantastic international experience boise needs to support this place the coffee place kahva has seriously flavorful coffee ive been lamenting the frothy bulls8 that a certain popular coffee place puts out for years this place had the single best cappuccino that ive had since i left europe  i ate at one of the middle eastern places and the rice and lamb dish was excellent there was a small area where one could have a true traditional eating experience you take off your shoes sit down on beautifully custom made furniture and go to work with your hands  a not so hidden gem is a record player in one of the corners where you can put on your own music the shelf is loaded with the best classics ever dean martin elvis commodores and many more old school greats  will return for sure","3374":"when a cupcake craving hits which seems to be happening now as i write this review  im most likely to hit up the closest flying cupcake location which is usually this mass ave location i appreciate that they dont pile on the frosting as much as some other cupcakeries and they never seem to be lacking in available varieties from the traditional to the more inventive regardless of what time i stop in","3378":"this place has heat donuts bit set the tone for our visit as the first place we tried in new orleans the pbj and mixed berry donuts were our faves it is a chill place with a kind of hipster feel you could easily be in brooklyn with the feel of the place worth a trip","3384":"these were amazing mardi gras snowball stuffed with cheesecake i got the throw me something mister and my husband got the fat tuesday","3390":"i came here after hearing multiple different people rave about this place saying how authentic the food was herewell they were right the inside is nice and clean with decorations such as fresh rose petals scattered in a bed of water with lit candles floating among them we started out with a few appetizers they were pretty good but the great food was our entrees i got the goat masala which was incredible if youve never tried goat i recommend it it tastes very similar to beefsteak and this restaurant prepares it deliciously the other people i was with both got chicken madras which was also good but i liked mine better all of our entrees came with a big pot of basmati an indian rice and freshly baked naan a type of flat bread which was a good bonus the service was a tad bit slow and it took a little longer than usual to get our food but that makes for more time to visit with and enjoy the company of friends and family overall you can expect well seasoned tasty authentic indian food from this restaurantand definitely another visit from me","3393":"great place for after work networking great food and tasty beer selection","3397":"i dont get the lack of love for this place currently a two star rating ive eaten at two star restaurants ive even eaten at a two star bjs before this location is leaps and bounds above that  a two star bjs makes you wait fifteen minutes to be seated even though the restaurant is have full every time ive visited the lutz location three currently ive gotten in and seated within a reasonable amount of time even though every booth and the bar was full   a two star bjs has a very inattentive server and kitchen staff who brings out the wrong order does not work around dietary restrictions despite their menu saying they will and leaves your glass empty for most of the meal at this bjs the server is checking on us constantly my glass of water remains full for the duration of the evening the longest i waited for it to be refilled was two minutes when i order the brussels sprouts i get the honey sricha sauce on the side not once have they failed to clarify my order and bring it out correctly as for the taste of the sprouts whoa doggy nicely charred and crispy and tossed in oil better brussels sprouts than ive had at any other tampa restaurant even my meat eating butter loving fat indulging friends cant keep their hands off them and thats without the sauce who knows how it would be if they offered a vegan sauce for those sprouts for my main course i am enamored with bjs vegan lentil soup ive eaten it both as a bread bowl hold the butter and regular bowl the soup is filling slightly spicy and flavorful rare is it to find a chain restaurant in tampa offering a vegan soup even rarer is the restaurant that offers a really good vegan soup on one occasion i ordered the mushroom and asparagus salad sans goat cheese if i had to do it over again id get the dressing on the side i dont have the same love affair with dressing as a lot of people so i usually find the amount that restaurants put on to be too much bjs was no different  a two star bjs has people working there that are unable to answer questions about the menu at the lutz location we had a gluten free diner seated with us she asked for the gluten free menu and they obliged she decided to order the gluten free pizza and asked the server about toppings the server said all toppings were gluten free except for the meatballs when another friend inquired about what barbacoa was the waitress gave her best answer and then double checked with someone else in order to ensure that my fellow diner could make an informed decision  a two star bjs does not bring out a garlic roll for the toddler who might be just a little less patient about waiting for her food the lutz location served my daughter a drink and a complimentary roll right away i thought this was a fabulous idea because my daughter is still at the age where she tells me she wants mac and cheese and she thinks it should be there moments later the roll helped to stem the constant where is my mac and cheese questions because she had something to snack on  does this location have some kinks to work out probably they mixed up checks once when i was there had her drinks on his and vice versa but considering that they are restaurant that has been open just a little over a month id say some kinks are to be expected   kinks and all im definitely a fan of bjs  that sounds dirty","3399":"quiet place in a charming building with local art adorning the wall and great for people watching by the french market while i did not have any of the gumbo which the sign said was the best in the city i did enjoy the fleur de lis omelet a large omelet with crayfish delicious sauce and that came with hash browns and toast   service was good prices were reasonable and this is a nice place to start your day before hitting the market or take a break in between to chill and take in the scene","3406":"this place has a really nice outdoor covered patiogreat service good foodusually willing to accommodate food allergies","3410":"we are regulars here great burger and fries the bun is soft and fresh fries are hand cut gave it a 5 because its always consistent wait staff is fast and food usually arrives quickly come hungry fries are unlimited i dont like their homemade ketchup so i request heinz and they always have it available ill be back probably next week the basic bear creek burger and fries is 10","3411":"this place never disappoints  john had the alligator sausage po boy and i had the boiled shrimp  yummy shrimp the best ive had in along time  we were looking forward to the duck debris po boy but its no longer on the menu  when visiting for dinner you must try the cold smoked tuna  cant be beat","3413":"love it broad ripple brewpub is and indy classic  i like how their decor has an irish flair with the contrast of light walls and dark woods and carpet and smaller dining rooms the outdoor dining gives a fun view of broad ripple foot traffic or the monon trail which i also enjoy  a great destination for a bike ride or as part of an afternoon in broad ripple  i enjoy the basic brat and chips when i visit and ive never been disappointed with what i order or with the service","3418":"we had breakfast here this morning based on the yelp reviews and were not disappointed    the coffee was great most important thing in my opinion and the food was also good  i had the french toast and while i cant say its in my top 10 of french toast it was good i tend to eat french toast in every town i go to for comparison  hee  mama had the blueberry pancakes and she said they tasted good  the bacon came out cooked just right   service was ok  we were not asked about refills which bothered me as i would have gotten a to go cup of coffee but overall the experience was good for the money","3422":"wowabsolutely fantastic breakfast this morningthe special omelette was just out of this world and the coffee was the best ive had at a restaurant in a long long timeservice was equally wonderfulgreat ambience music open feel definitely check this place out sooner rather than latergood job ","3432":"itsugar is a fun new candy store in the village   fill full of all kinds of sweet treats for all ages  they have hundreds of packaged candy and hundreds of others that are sold by weight a  little on the expensive side but what the heck   the staff was very freindly and very eager to help the ankle bitters  so just another great reason to check out the village","3436":"its a nice welcome to otherwise not very attractive part of town on a busy intersection between bears and nebraska culvers is a welcome additions if you are into fast food restaurant like a greasy hamburger and fried chicken sandwich you would added to your already long list of fast food restaurant along fletcher ave for me it is the many flavors of delicious custard that draw me into culvers and thats what the 4 stars is about","3439":"oh auntie annes how can you be so good when all your pretzels are is dough and extreme amounts of butter   i have worked at auntie annes in the past so i try to stir away from it the fact that every single item is dumped in butter makes me want to vomit however i had an odd craving for some cinnamon sticks on my lunch break recently i came here at the end of my lunch break so i was able to order as soon as i walked up to the cash register the cashier was very friendly and did not forget to ask me about sauces everything was in stock and looked fresh my cinnamon sticks were delicious and filled my craving  if and when i do have a craving for auntie annes again in my lunch break i will come here again","3445":"i feel like a minority owner after dining at clear sky 3 days in a row we were at the clearwater seafood and blues festival and had never explored downtown clearwater and in doing so found clear sky on cleveland which is the main drag for dt clearwater good restaurants keep themselves from becoming great restaurants by slipping up on the small things on friday night the cleveland location was packed but our 715pm reservation was waiting so we sat and waited and waited  and finally our server stopped by to tell us she would be right back so we waited some more  when she did come back we ordered the highly recommended avocado fries and wine  and waited and waited some more  finally got the wine  and then waited and waited and waited some more  only to learn that the avocado fries we waited and waited for were no longer available certainly disappointing then the entrees were also delayed and our server offered were really packed tonight as an excuse when they did arrive the grilled oysters and oysters rockefeller and the flatbread were excellent   the blues festival kudos to the organizers as the line up was fantastic kept us in the area on saturday so we returned to the scene of the crime on saturday night seating was immediate and service was very attentivebut the entree chicken saltimbocca was over cooked dried out and very crustywe noted this to the server who apologized left and returned with the manager on duty we had to try to cut the chicken to prove our point to him upon which he said he could replace the entree with another a no cost the replacement chicken sataya was flavorful but arrived late the server provided us a bogo card for the trouble  so being the gluttons for punishment we are on sunday morning we went to the clear sky location in clearwater beach for breakfast thinking that the third time will be the charm close but no cigarwe were quickly seated waited on and served returning to my midwest roots i ordered the  country fried steak and eggs with grits the eggs and grits were fine the chicken fried steak must have been cooked by the same chef that did the saltimbocca on friday night it was over cooked tough and chewy my gracious and beautiful bride enjoyed her omelet so not all was lost  we certainly enjoyed the ambiance of both locations and experienced somewhat acceptable service but missing on the details keeps clear sky on our maybe not again listthree strikes and youre out","3447":"this is one of those places that continue to surprise me here in new orleans  that a convenience store food mart serves vietnamese food and it seems pretty legit i discovered the place when i did a banh mi search on yelp i was surprised but probably would not have made the effort to go if it wasnt located right next door to the aristocat nail salon where i had a living social coupon for a mani pedi the owner of the salon is vietnamese and i trust that she knows her food and she highly recommended the place so far ive only had a banh mi there which is a bit different than other ones ive had i usually go with the standard cold cut combo but eat wells is overstuffed with barbecue pork it s really delicious but it can also be a tad bit greasy but you know sometimes grease is good the people who work there are really nice and you can call in and theyll have it ready for pick up and they dont seem to mind when i ask for extra pickled carrots and daikon oh and extra spicy too now i go out of my way to pick up a banh mi before work mmmm  im hungry now just thinking of it","3448":"aldi is a weird yet somehow entertaining experience for me the bring your own bag concept prevents waste so i think thats a good thing their fit and active sugar free jam is superb youd never know it was sugar free their vegetables and fruit are the cheapest ive found but and its a big hairy but youve got to contend with the some odd characters shopping there i dont mean dawn of the morbidly obese living dead like you find at a walmart but odd nonetheless their belgium blue moon knock off is fantastic and at the price hard to beat","3451":"we went for the lunch buffet  there are about four veggie dishesthe methi potato korma was amazing we had fresh naan with ghee brought to the table  service was friendly and fast the place is unassuming from outside but give it a try","3453":"prices are reasonable  the owner and the staff is friendly  the place is clean  the garlic soy wings and fries are delicious","3457":"the ice cream here is delicious portion size is very generous and the staff is nice and patient we had the morning coffee and rum raisin flavors the dessert side of the place is super cute but could be a bit cleaner for a slow afternoon the tables were pretty dirty and there were a few flies the pricing for the neighborhood makes it still worthy though","3458":"this is a great gem we discovered that looks to be a neighborhood favorite that is away from all the commotion happening downtown we wanted something a bit more hip yet quick and good this place delivered all the way around the coffee was good the bagel breakfast sandwich was outstanding and the vibe was spot on if youre okay with hipsters  in all seriousness i loved the local vibe and would probably frequent this spot if i lived nearby","3459":"i eat here once every weektwo the service is always friendly and the drinks are the best ive had better pho the pad thai ive been told isnt the most authentic but its cheap and good so i usually get that its just in building at a busy intersection so its not always convenient to get there and out of there quickly","3460":"had a wonderful dinner tonight sat at a table with view of delaware river fresh delicious food and great atmosphere ","3465":"schlafly is rock solid beer that usually wont blow you away but you wont be disappointed  their fresh hopped ale harvest ale this 2010 was amazing but the other styles are by microbrewery standards perfectly acceptable  the reason i felt the need to add to the 90 reviews is that i think it is worth noting that this is a beercentric place that is also welcoming to kids or at least highly tolerant of them  i have taken my 2 year old there several times and have never been made to feel that he is not welcome there are always other kids  however i dont think the presence of kids detracts from the atmosphere for adults because they have large bar and biergarten  the food is pretty good and they use a lot of local ingredients  i have taken out of town guests there on multiple occasions","3470":"good ice cream try the cinnamon very popular located in the don caesar hotel but has a street level entrance   one scoop is plenty","3476":"i am a fan this place is a local institutionthe prices are high but the quality and service are very good awesome sushi too i wish the aisles were wider","3479":"this place is at the end of the pier and is awesome  had some great clam chowder  not too many seats only about 4 or 5 outside and some more inside but this is the best food on the pier  we got lucky to find parking on the pier however it looked like it could be hard to find open spots during peak hours","3480":"awesome lunchwaitress was very pleasant and has a great service attitudemy lunch was hot and was brung to us fastthe restaurant was clean and quiet and it was a pleasant experience will be back soonthanks guys ","3485":"we stopped in on a fluke saturday afternoon we were treated to one of the best vegetarian pizzas we have ever had i would certainly go back","3488":"what an awesome treat  we were down the road at diggerland and a local friend told us of this place  im so glad he did as we really enjoyed our food  this place is located on a main road in a small strip mall     there is a main counter where you can order food and take it to go    we sat in the side room which had waiter service  the waiter were really nice and helpful  the kid had a chicken tender kids meal which was 5  it came with two tenders and fries which was plenty for him for lunch     i had the caprese chicken with a side bowl of tomato soup  the caprese had mozzerlla tomoato basil pesto on  grilled italian bread  hubby had the mushroom and feta with fries  his sandwich had american provolone muenster feta mushroom and argula    we each took a half a sandwich   i wish i cut those halfs in half it was huge  three hours later we are still full   the sandwiches were amazing   the fries were tasty    the soup was really good   its hard to make good tomato soup and they have it down packed  im a soup eater and i wish i lived closer to get this soup more often  im not a big grilled cheese eater but im glad i tried this place  i was not disappointed  if i am in the area i would definitely stop in again","3491":"if i could eat here all the time i would  their breakfast is amazing so is their lunch and dinner now that i think about it  they offer so many different foods and the prices are super cheap  the owners are funny and really nice so are the waitresses  food comes quick and they check on you often but not too often  this is my favorite diner around","3493":"the dope one of the best brownies ive ever had the employees are terrific  very friendly stay away from the bacon chocolate chip cookie though bacon and chocolate just dont go together","3497":"im pretty apathetic about sushi and still loved my experience at izumi first of all its byob second its a nice atmosphere and somewhat upscale which is not always the case with byobs   we went with a big group of seven and were struggling about how much to order what to pick etc our waiter gave us a couple typical options then offered to just select dishes for us and course it out  he promised to be fair with portionsprices which i was pretty skeptical about but it turned out amazing he brought a sashimi appetizer gyoza tuna with avocado  ponzu sauce excellent a selection of maki there was a special monster roll with soft shell crab on top that was great then finally a selection of sashimi its not exactly what we wouldve ordered had we just done it ourselves but everything was delicious and we each ended up paying around 25 not tons of food but definitely enough   not bad at all","3498":"wowthis is a pretty interesting burger place on a pretty noninteresting street  what do i mean about interesting  at least 16 different types of burgers9 different types of sugar cane root beers a huge alcohol menu alcoholic floats ice creamtheyve got a lot of everything here  now on to the review about the place itself  1 waitstaff  back story two of us in our party had our minds made up even though we were originally deciding between two different burgers  it took the waiter about 3 seconds to get us to change our minds due to the burger being his personal favorite  everyone we encountered was friendly and accommodating  2 facility  this place is huge with an upstairs and downstairs seating area and it is definitely great for large groups  the environment was very casual yet not rowdy  3 burgers  i decided to go with the abc burger which contained roasted apples bacon and i gotta say it was definitely interesting and thoroughly enjoyable  my other coworkers decided to get the morocco burger spiced lamb caramelized onion chutney feta arugula and seemed to be extremely satisfied  everything on the food menu is homemade and locallyraised  4 fries  yep the fries deserved their own little section  4 gets you a large helping big enough for 23 to share comfortably along with one of their 10 different dipping sauces  we went with the beer mustard and the crazy sauce  wasnt a big fan of the beer mustard but the crazy sauce was goodessentially a mix of sriracha and homemade ketchup    5 ice cream  obviously had to try a little bit of their most eclectic flavorthree chili chocolate tastes like rocky road ice cream going inand then you get a kick to your taste buds through some chili powder towards the end  wasnt quite sure if i enjoyed it or not i finished it all but it was definitely an interesting experience  overall i really like this place and would recommend it to any group or casual diner  prices are in the 912 range for burgers but can quickly add up if you get a ton of the other stuff","3500":"my local supermarket of choice i have shopped here consistently since 2000 it is a very busy store with a lot of walk in customers selfscan is convenient for small orders it now carries a lot more selection of local products the busiest shopping day of the week is generally sundays","3501":"i think tbar has been discovered  went here a few weeks ago after searching for study spots on yelp and reading about what a quiet and uncrowded place it was so i was fairly surprised to find it well crowded and noisy im not saying it was like i was in the club or anything but it wasnt the serene study oasis id expected especially since i got stuck studying at the bar and had to sit on a backless barstool which is less than optimal for hunching over a contracts textbook for hours  all that aside they have scores of varieties of tea and you can get an entire pot for just a few bucks and the pots come with cookies they also have helpful descriptions of each particular tea for novices like myself that explain the flavors and effects it is also a nice open and welllit space definitely seems like it would make an excellent meeting spot  bottom line not the best place to study at least not on the weekends  but a great tea house with a cozy setup and tons of different teas","3507":"hoe excited was i to find a gluten free vegan pizza up charge option staff was super accommodating and courteous when ordering gluten free it is common to be asked allergy or preferance but when i get down the line to add my toppings they actually switched gloves to prevent cross contamination which i have never seen before so thought full  the price is pretty good for a personal pizza in this area   the crusts are my favorite and are thin and nicely cooked   lots of choices for toppings ","3514":"this is a great greek restaurant the staff is always friendly and love yelling opa  the melted flaming cheese is easily the best app you should get that every time  they do serve pita that seems to be fried on one side that is also incredible  the salads are great a little strange with the potato salad under it all but the dressing makes up for that  main course i know the whole fish is great  i also like the gyro platter and the grape leaves  dessert is probably the best  great baklava and the greek cannolis are similar to lobster tails in boston","3526":"i got the darkness chocolate croissant and the tiramisu brownie the darkness was a little underwhelming not much flavor despite the boasting of chocolatey goodness it was also a little too salty for my tastes however the tiramisu brownie was delicious and moist kind of reminded me of a cream cheese brownie the decor and ambiance of choquette was as always beautiful  bright airy delicate and dainty are a few words that come to mind i love staring at the pretty cakes chocolate shoes and princesses on display","3527":"the historic railroad depot building is neat the rye whiskey is good the blue corn whiskey is not the chicken squash salad with pinenuts and arugula is not that good because the chicken is poor quality the bathrooms are nice its a good place for college people and hipsters","3531":"this store is amazing   i stopped going to walmart a year ago because they treat the employees like crap they are underpaid and most dont have health insurance   yesit is cheapbut at what cost    so i needed another store   the difference in the customer service alone is worth it     great floral section amazing fresh fruit section and the baked and organic breads are so good    with the app on your phone when you go into the store in registers what you usually buy and you get great deals on that    sometimes it gets you out of your comfort zone with things that are new   i love it","3542":"why did we not find this place before we went to the habit burger grill only on the last day of our trip to santa barbara and channel islands this place serves the best burger thumbsdown and also has pretty decent customer service the veggie burger and sweet potato fries were made just right and were eaten in less than 30 minutes a happy stomach is what we walked out with ","3550":"burgers are the true ambassadors of all things usa they are the first thing i mention when i am asked about what i find great about this country and i insist that they are better here than anywhere else a good foodie city must also have good burgers and philadelphia does not disappoint  we came to 500 degrees because it is close to the kimmel center rattle was pretty awesome tonight and because it is a place that pops up when asked about burgers in philly besides bobbys burger palace was disappointing lately so we were craving for something new  500 degrees is surprisingly lowly ranked on yelp but similar to bobbys burger palace i have the impression that its actually due to its popularity bbp has weaknesses  inconsistent burgers occasionally horrible service and unpleasant atmosphere when its packed 500 degrees also has its fair share of weaknesses i thought their sauces was rather bad especially the ketchup and while i appreciate their open kitchen i didnt really want to see how their fries are taken out of the freezer instead of being freshly cut on the other hand their burger totally makes up for it we got a 500 and a classic with guacamole both medium rare along with truffle fries and sweet potato fries the burgers were cooked exactly the way we would have expected medium rare to be they were juicy and both their cheddar and provolone went well with the burger i should also mention that i especially liked the slight sweetness of the buns despite being taken out of the freezer the truffle fries are actually wellmade because they spray truffle oil at the end keeping the fries nicely crispy finally the sweet potato fries were delicious but not overwhelming  with 1250 for a burger truffle fries and a fountain drink i thought the prices were pretty good cheaper than bobbys burger palace at least all in all this is a place i would enjoy to come back to because their burgers and the big choices of toppings come at a good price","3552":"great beer great atmosphere awesome food truck  i would have given a 5 star if i had a place to sit outside get some outdoor tables and chairs","3553":"visited hopewell valley vineyard on a rainy tuesday afternoon  we were the only customers and i enjoyed the experience  the staff was knowledgable and the choice of 6 wines for the wine sampling was a nice way to end the day  one of their labels specifically supports autism research  enjoyed the white merlot and and white port","3558":"great place to take out of towners it has a great atomosphere that is family friendly  it is quick to get your food once your sat however there may be a line to get inside  be it is worth the wait so walk inside the door and grab a local magizine to read and find your next great thing to do in nashville","3559":"very nice and conveniently located in stpete  parking may be a little confusing but you should figure out in the first min or so  i really liked the cheese room and the wine cellar was nice too  this place is so far away from conventional markets its why people like it so much  from the specail imported products to the butcher block you wont be disappointed  my wife really likes the deserts and pastas  its hard for us to visit all the time but when ever were up that way we would like to try and stop again","3566":"ive eaten here a bunch of times for me its fast and convenient its like every other chinese take out the difference is the food isnt horrible im not saying its amazing grace but its definitely doable also the folks who own it are warm and polite and for me that goes a long way so go ahead and order your usual itll be just fine","3581":"good coffee on the pricier side but any alternative to starbucks in newtown is welcome fast and friendly service and lots of seating the ambience is pretty good for working but the wifi can be spotty or extremely slow","3584":"so maybe im living in denial when i tell myself and others that i am not a dessert person yes i love cookies and ice cream but cakes and pies and pots of cream with crispy burnt sugar tops are not my thing i dont crave them i pass on them all the timeexcept when they are from the swiss pastry shop now the swiss haus my mom knew this and wed always get a cake from here when i would visit whether it was my birthday as with my 35th which is the picture above or some other event i dont know the exact number but we passed many bakery on our out of the way journey to get hereif youre driving bring a friend so you can double park and run in quickly parking is scarce   the chocolates are amazing the italian cremes out of this world but the simple rum cake was my favorite vanilla sponge cake with rum infused butter cream frosting with cashews pressed into the sides ","3585":"hands down my favorite bar in east nashville its super close to my house and away from the 5 points madness just wish they stayed open a little later","3588":"good local joint with a wide selection of beers and great food lots of seating and family friendly if you dont want to be around kids theres an upstairs bar for the 21 and over crowd worth the trip you wont be disappointed","3600":"a tucson original these guys have been in business for a very long time and they have really good fried chicken fried chicken strips fried steak strips and fried shrimp all of the food is really good just kinda pricey or would give 5 stars","3602":"the doughnuts were decent but the doughnut holes were ridiculously delicious  they were like fluffy doughnut pillows that melt in your mouth  not to mention the place is super cheap  we got six doughnuts a dozen doughnut holes and three milks for under ten bucks  its not a cool hang out joint the place is really dated but dont let that keep you from trying the crazy good doughnut holes","3605":"i had never been there before but when i walked in the first thing i noticed was how pristine clean it was and this coming from someone who has been diagnosed with ocd so i was very pleased the lady in the front was very nice and helpful when i was deciding what to buy my mom who i was taking lunch to she was patient with me and very polite only reason why i didnt give 5 stars is 1  i didnt eat their food but mom enjoyed and 2  the wait was very long next time ill order in advance over all i will be back to try next time myself","3607":"had my first taste of rolling feasts southwestinspired fare using local ingredients at a bank promotion surprisingly prompt service supersavory flavors in a vegetarian enchilada loaded with black beans corn eggplant squash tomatoes and topped with fresh pico de gallo bursting with flavor but almost too heavy a meal for lunch also tasted the quesadilla made with goat cheese mozzarella prosciutto lightly toasted and served with a sour creambased sauce on the side would love to try some of their other creations seen other websitebut today was a limited offering the locally sourced fresh veggies and madeintruck rolls and dishes are just what a lot of us foodies are looking for surprising that i havent seen any other reviews of this truckespecially since theyve been open since 2013 in any eventcheck them out via twitter or nashville food truck app","3609":"the most pricey market around but for a reason they carry a wide range of everything great store brand products and something for every eating style whole foods also gives local brands a chance to feature in store has hot food w good flavor profiles a cheeses section as big as a walk in closet and on certain days give a ways the store is clean and sports a friendly knowledgeable staff that rarely lets the lines get too long you can grab organic anything and also something for your skin while youre here they really do sell everything you may spend your weight in gold before you leave but youll be satisfied","3610":"great drinks good ambiance nice setup waitress was a little slow but once it started flowing everything was good i cant wait to get back up there and order a plate of dungeness crabs drool","3612":"sucky bagels but great coffeethats pretty much the gist of it this is the only nonchainbajillion calorie eateries around my office from our front door all i see is burger king wendys kfc and popeyesits a food lovers wasteland  its nice to have an independently owned coffee shop and sandwich joint within a block of the office because quite frankly im usually too lazy to make my own coffee and would rather starve than eat fast food on a daily basis vinny p just started working downtown in exchange i moved out of cc for work and now i feel the pains of working amongst people that have no idea what good food and coffee tastes like my manager knew what i was leaving behind when taking my new position in this neighborhood and immediately introduced me to wired beans skip the bagel but do order the coffee its la colombe and has helped me to somewhat fill the void of the smiling faces i was so accustomed to seeing daily at dilworth plaza   i havent been back for lunch yet so i cant attest to their sandwiches but if theyre as quiet during the day as they are when i stop to grab my coffee then this may be my new favorite lunch spot when needing a break from the crazies that come through my office the shop reminds me a bit of central perk on friends with its eclectic mix of furniture and the locals that are often enjoying their morning cups of coffee it has a generally cofortable and welcoming feel to it and the staff is really friendly as far as i know theres no credit card minimum but ill have to report back later on that free wifi open mic nights a kidlet section complete with toys and a lengthy food and drink menu all add extra appeal to this cute shop nestled amongst chelten plaza where other storefronts in the plaza stay barren this is the blocks shining star   if youre in the area do stop by i dont know that they are necessarily hurting for business but this quiet coffee shop is a nice reprieve for those with chaotic work days and neighbors who need a little pickmeup theres something for everyone here and i for one am thrilled to have them so close by","3618":"aldi is small so its easy and quick to get in and out if you only need a few things they have many organic items the vegetables are ok but i found the fruit to be low quality and not tasty the chocolate bars and crackers are good they have really good brie cheese thats very reasonably priced they dont not have shopping bags so bring your own you will also need a quarter so you can get a cart which you get back when you return the cart parking is convenient in the lot right there in this shoppng center theres also a dunkin donuts","3621":"this place is great for quick delicious extremely well priced authentic italian food the people working there are extremely friendly and helpful this place is no frills and nit where youd want to bring a date but if you are in the mood for some serious eating  with no hassle stop by here be prepared for  mess and dont wear your good clothes i had to use my tie for a napkin like an 17th century english nobleman  after mycalzone dripped all over me i kept eating but i had to throw my tie away still well worth it","3628":"i felt like being such the tourist and went to the anheuser busch factory   i was impressed by it and as much as i thought it would be a lame waste of time i really enjoyed it    i learned a few things like the fact that beachwood adds no flavor to the beer at all   it is the same wood that popsicle sticks are made from  they add it to the brewing process so the yeast works better   i learned that at the only difference between bud and bud light is that bud light spends one additional hour in one part of the process which lightens the beer  budweiser owns other brands like stella and goose island  i loved the old buildings and enjoyed the history     the horses were cool  i didnt turn down the cup of budweiser that they gave me at one point in the tour or the free one you get in the beer garden   i ordered goose island more to my liking   i enjoyed meeting a bud employee  great guy  the official barber for the company  we sat at the bar and talked motorcycles","3630":"i really loved it here makes me wish i lived closer and could stop by everyday i had the dark hot chocolate  it was made in every way i like milky chocolatey whipped creamyy they had a maple bacon latte i couldve gone for buuuut i just wasnt ready for the challenge the atmosphere is gorgeous wooden floors dark decor big comfy chairs makes it cozy and warm they also have a great looking selection of wines and some snacks as well i think if youre planning to take a date coworker hipster friend parent here is a great place to do it  only down side is when i went i found it very crowded my drink although worth it took a good while to come about and the lemony water in the pretty dispenser was empty  i was thirsty  i do love this hipster haven","3631":"went for friday night italian dinner feast bring a group of friends to eat drink byob and be merry so much food and you can ask for a box to bring some home with you too they dance between course which is entertaining its loud so it may be hard for older adults to hear they change their menu each season try them all fun for out of town wars because its a 3 hour affair","3633":"its firehouse always consistent throughout the chain i like the subs here my only complaint is with their ice tea its way too weak always this particular location also seems to be least enthusiastic about the  welcome to firehouse greeting  always but thats ok gives hubby and i something to joke about when we eat here and weve been coming here since they opened","3638":"i got a mint chocolate waffle cone and it was delicious one scoop is a ton and will surely get you by my husband had a coffee waffle cone which was also really good the service was nice not super chatty or overly enthusiastic but he was pleasant i would definitely go here again and try the cookies","3639":"amazing atmosphere and nice beer selection  one of my favorite places for social gatherings as well as to take visitors from out of town","3643":"this is a very good bake shop that does well on both sweet and savory items  the only reason i dont rate it five stars is because they could improve on their customer service  my favorites from the sweets are the carrot cakes macaroons and chocolate chip cookies  on the savory side their breakfast pockets are excellent  they also serve above average pizza but its overpriced and tends to be too salty in my opinion  the only wholly negative experiences ive had with the place are the occasional rude employees  for example the place takes delivery orders and once an employee actually had the gall to tell me to hurry up and that he didnt have all day while i was placing an order over the phone how rude  and sometimes theyre a bit reluctant to elaborate and describe items when deliberating between the vast array of treats they offer  i feel they should help because the item names are generally not indicative of what they are so the employees should help you understand what youre buying  ps  if the place offered free tap water like starbucks i think it would make a huge positive difference because its a long and unconventional walk for many people to get here","3646":"while on vacation in clearwater my family and i traveled to tarpon springs for greek food we chose to eat dinner at hellas we were promptly seated and greeted by our friendly native greek waiter nando we started with an assortment of greek dips ie classic hummus red pepper and feta hummus and tzatsiki along with warm fresh pita  best pita ever the spread was delicious and perfect for 6 people we also started with the lemon egg soup although a bit creamier in texture than im used to it was still very delicious for main dishes we ordered the fantastic and huge greek salad that included large slices of fresh feta and delicious greek style potato salad my sister and i ordered the chicken souvlaki sandwich pretty simple pita sandwich with juicy chunks of grilled chicken also had a side of greek style fries  long thick cut steak fries perfectly golden brown with lemon and feta my father ordered a classic greek dish pastitsio its basically a greek style lasagna with ground beef tubular shaped pasta and a tomato cream sauce the dish was a delicious traditional meal with a crunchy cheese coating and piping hot beef filling served alongside peas and rice our guest ordered the pan fried grouper a huge piece of fish that looked delicious all meals were affordable ranging from 8  souvlaki to 13 pastitsio to 15  grouper we ended the meal with desserts  amazing baklava at the hellas bakery my only drawbacks were the service as dirty plates were left on our table throughout our meal and drinks were never refilled promptly the decor is also very tacky in a meditaranean greek disco club sort of way but gave the place some charm all in all i would recommend hellas to any out of towners looking to experience the local tarpon springs greek culture","3648":"cramped feeling but very friendly staff   we know that wf is always a great place to grab a healthy snack or drink today it was just a giant bottle of 365 brand bottled water for 69 cents when were traveling and this visit was no exception","3649":"full disclosurei stumbled on this place by accident and didnt drink so why 4 stars well waze led me astray for the first time ever and took us to this address the employees chuckled that we meant to go to st bens they kindly offered a tour of their magnificent building interspersing it with whiskey trivia if i wasnt such a cheap date id have had samples but whiskey before beer is a no go for me i will go back for sure being kind to folks wandering thru south kensington is a sure fire way to gain a customer next time im in those parts","3658":"its a pub its a kitchen its pub  kitchen  ive been here for brunch happy hour and a late dinner and all three times were solid they have outdoor seating and big windows which they open up in nice weather so even if youre sitting inside you can enjoy some sunshine  their kitchen is open late which is a big plus for me ive eaten here after 11 on a wednesday night so they must serve food until at least 12 on weeknights big fan  you may have heard good things about the burger these things are true it totally delivers although pk has a good beer selection i chose to wash down my burger with some champagne cause thats how i roll   to top it off the staff is always very friendly and the music they play sounds like my indie station on pandora i like this place more and more every time i go cant wait to go back again and try the welsh rarebit","3660":"ha ha i see this site is now called out on google maps  i guess most normal people have no problem getting off the freeway and getting into the lot but sometimes i  fail    once there though the product is consistent and reliable  bathrooms arent gross either","3661":"ive been here on the east coast and am thrilled theyre open in tucson the cookies are warm and soft ice cream is rich and creamy this is a great spot to grab a bite in downtown the staff are friendly and the menu is simple they are opened until 3am daily the space is handicap accessible and spacious yay cookies","3673":"ive been there twice now  real good food  friendly staff  nice environment even with the construction going on at the strip mall  the bakery looks great too though we havent picked up anything yet","3674":"good selection  produce is always fresh when we have been there register employees are always friendly i do like the little salad bar thing in the front of the store along with the wide selection of bakery items the blueberry muffins are awesome my kids always like the randomly decorated doughnuts the fresh salsasbrushettas are good as well","3675":"pags rules this street with three separate venues a pizza place a fancier italian restaurant and the superromantic wine bar we love  the front room looks like an old time train station waiting area with its dramatic hanging lights banquettes and tiny tables and the bridgette bardot poster    the wine menu is heavily french and not cheap so savor those glasses but they will give you a taste before you invest  for example they had a veuve cliquot yellow label open to try by the glass 13 and a full bottle was 84   most wine places dont have such an expensive bottle available for glasses  the last time we went we were in the mood for ros\u00e9 having just accomplished one of lifes milestones  due to excellent recommendations from the owner we developed a major crush on pommery champagne which they had as splits in two different versions pink and blue  oh such a cute halfsize wine bucket too  there is a full bar not just wine and sometimes they bring out free tapas such as kalamata olives plus a little dish for the pits nice touch  we have enjoyed the arugula pizza back in our ovolacto days but you dont come here for the food  the building is long and narrow so the back part is even darker and more intimate if you need to hide out and there is a tiny patio in front though i have never seen anyone on it  music can be anything from classic jazz to electronica and i dont remember any tvs hurray  recently nina simone was playing just perfect for our mood  my bf got into a discussion about indian and brazilian music with the owner who then played some recommended brazilian artists from his own collection for us and wrote down the names so we could hunt them down later  interlibrary loan  ipod  amazingly broad and deep music collection ssssh","3676":"shout out to the peanut butter cookie cream pie shake bro thats what i am talking about so simpleso good id get that again and again","3680":"wonderful went two days in a row during our weekend visit to philadelphia we found it by dumb luck and then my daughter said i have to take you to my favorite bakery it was swiss haus great treats for all and excellent coffee friendly too","3682":"great small and quaint latin supermarket lots of fresh veggies at a lower price than publix  check out their extensive selection of latin american products","3683":"i had the popcorn chicken wontons in spicy chili oil pig stomach and mustard green soup and beef chow fun  popcorn chicken mediocre the breading was too thick and a little bland i tasted some sweetness which i found unusual for popcorn chicken definitely could have done without  wontons in spicy chili oil flavorful with a good spicy kick they actually give you a decent amount considering it is an appetizer id recommend if you like spicy  pig stomach and mustard green soup ive actually never had the soup prior to my visit here but was up to try something new it has a pickledsour taste from the mustard greensthe pig stomach has a slightly chewy texture and there is a white peppery taste in the broth i was actually surprised that i liked the soup  beef chow fun the noodles were a little too al dente for my liking and i think it could have used a little more soy sauce or flavoring  overall reasonably priced food good variety and food is pretty decent very casual ambiance and only had to wait a few minutes for a party of two next time im in reno id probably return  theres a yelp deal 10 off your bill of 45 and the restaurant also has an app 101 taiwanese which sometimes has coupons but when i went i didnt find any current coupons","3687":"tired of eating junk for lunch when you crave something healthy this is a good choice great salads cold wraps and hot burritos yummy tomato basil soup plenty of  fresh juice choices","3692":"full disclosure im writing this review while sitting in the business itself which in part is why i love this place so much  the relaxing atmosphere that jersey java provides is second to none its a great location to unwind with a friend book or just a coffee oh and dont forget the baked goods for which they have a wide variety cookies quiche homemade pop tarts to just name a few   and whats a coffee shop without the coffee their house blend falcon head is quite good and i highly recommend it from cappuccinos to chai lattes they have it all and bonus marks for the perfectly executed heart on that cappuccino   jersey java has become part of my weekly rotation for good reason and i look forward to coming here every weekend cheers","3693":"i used the shoprite home ordering option the staff was great called me to let me know that they didnt have as many of one item as i had requested which was nice to know ahead of time when i went to pick up the order it was ready and i also got a free july 4th cake again the staff was very helpful and friendly","3694":"my husband and i came here after a 5k at the laurel hill cemetery it was crazy packed around 7 on a sat night so we grabbed seat at the bar we each had a couple of cocktails and menu items we had the short rib gnocchi and cheese plate the food was really good and looked good judging other peoples plates i liked the vibe of the place and would like to check it out again","3696":"strong and not at all bitter espresso and my first introduction to gooey butter cake which why did no one tell me about this before like eating a stick of butter dipped in sugar so yes","3698":"okay so its obvious that this place is one of the top choices for breakfast in nashville the service and food is 5 stars hands down   if you order pancakes and why wouldnt you at a place called pancake pantry you must try one of the syrups they provide it is a cinnamon honey concoction which is absolutely heaven heaven you will not regret   the 4 stars is for the long long wait have a little snack before you come and stand in line also there is free coffee near the entrance for the 2 hour or so wait we discovered this after we went across the street to provence to buy coffee","3701":"this is my local walgreens and theyre very helpful here everyone from the pharmacist to the cashiers is always willing to help if something rings up wrong they fix it immediately without the eye roll you get from most the line for the pharmacy can get quite long during peak hours so i always try to avoid going here directly after work","3706":"this place is definitely up there with the good pho places in the area its major advantage is the design your own pho soup i definitely never was able to order a tofu flank and brisket combo anywhere until i came here fried spring rolls were considered good at the table i couldnt eat due to shrimp allergies eating area is spacious and staff is good i definitely recommend","3711":"i made my first visit to blakes yesterday i give it a 35 its a great addition to the fast food scene here a different more hip vibe and a decent burger  i love that their ketchup packets actually have a useful amount of ketchup in them free wifi is a plus i used it and it worked great the staff were friendly and it seemed sincere they seem happy to be working there  the lotaburger came with a substantial meat patty that had good flavor and texture  two complaints  the chocolate milkshake was bad  its the dreaded ice milk from my childhood that the family would buy when we were on hard times financially  a huge yuk didnt even finish it  also the hatch green chiles were too hot  i love hot as evidenced by my high ratings for poco and moms here in tucson and for various nm food venues  but this was ridiculous just too much which takes away from enjoying not only the chile but the hamburger  i guess if frat boys want to get into a competition to survive high heat in their mouth this is the place for them  but the rest of us will have to make a more palatable green chile burger at home  if i go again and i might ill have a burger sans green chile and stick with a soda rather than the shake","3716":"stopped in for a bahn mi poboy after wats and it was great the prices are a little more than you would pay elsewhere but the quality was there a friend had the vietnamese curry that was huge cheap and outstanding i cant wait to go back and try the curry again for myself alot of competition in the new food scene area on girod and okeefe","3721":"love this place except the last time i went the guy said he could make a lavender tea iced not sure why it couldnt be poured over ice it had been before but i still love this place and the vibes","3727":"really great beer  liked the free video games and skeeball as well  tacos were delicious but they could expand the menu a bit","3730":"great breakfast and brunch place good friendly service i had the sweet potato hash which was very different would definitely recommend this place  lots of variety and pastries and mimosas looked good only downside for me was no espresso  ","3736":"this custard is goodso is culversthat being said when you order a tart cherry custard for your daughter who wants pink custard and cant have strawberries only to see strawberries in her custard a couple minutes after shes been eating it then being told by the teenage boy with a sarcastically dirty look you just now noticed not the best customer service skillsyeah i just noticed because my daughter was eating it not mei didnt see any when i handed it to herand then he proceeds to begrudgingly request they make an actual tart cherry custardughfrustrating","3738":"ive been to 3 nights markets so far chinatown 2011 mt airy 2012 chinatown 2012 and cant wait for it to return this summer the experience is awesome crowds of people lines of food trucks live music always a great time  my favorite experience was my first in chinatown mainly based on the food that i had i have no idea which truck i got this from but i have been dreaming about the butternut squash and sweet potato lasagna i had almost 2 years ago heavenly other standouts were a variety of tacos from guapos tacosdespite the long ass line and corn on the cob straight from the grill  mt airy was also great great hilly street with food trucks going on forever standouts included margherita pizza from nomad and korean tacos  cant wait to go this coming season hopefully in a spot i havent been before","3744":"i looked here on yelp then went downtown looking for a breakfast adventure  as my husband called it  lately every restaurant seems to have the same coffee supplier in boise and it all tastes somewhat like dishwater  but only having had 1 cup before going i decided the heck with it i wanted a cup of coffee    so let me start off with saying the coffee is awesome  they get it from the coop and it was really good  the waitresses were all really friendly and the food was cooked quickly and was good  i had a breakfast burrito and it was ok it could have used some type of spanish sauce with it it did come with a bit of picodegallo and that saved it from being bland  the breakfast potatoes were very good  our servings were large  we would definitely go back again  we had a good hearty breakfast in an atmosphere that was totally enjoyable it doesnt matter where you come from you will feel at home at moons","3750":"im sitting in this location right now and im very pleased the inside looks clean and wellkept maybe even recently refurbished i think most people use the drivethrough so its not too crazy inside however the parking lot is a nightmare so watch out for that the person on the register wasnt terribly nice but the service was very fast on the plus side they do have free functional wifi unlike some of the other dd locations that ive visited lately id definitely come back again","3754":"ive eaten take out from enzos before and dined there for the first time in nov the food have had pasta dishes as well as pizza is excellent  and the prices are fair unfortunately the service was mediocre the server seemed indifferent the entire time i asked for item to be omitted from my pasta and they forgot to put it on the order to the kitchen we asked for more rolls whoops i forgot took forever to get a refill on sodas and then presented the check without asking if we wanted desert we did but decided to go someplace else for an after dinner drink hopefully this is just one bad apple because the food is great","3756":"oh crabby bills i think of you often so cbs has this fantastic raw oyster deal and the oysters are a fair size as you can see by other peoples pictures  the oysters are cheaper than i found in even new orleans so take advantage  my first time i went to cbs i had the fish tacos  i was not fond of the mango salsa mixed with the cilantro cream sauce  i am usually a big fan of mixing things like that but the mango salsa was just overpowering and weird with the fish flavor tooand yeah i wont order the fish tacos ever again  clearly others like the flavor or they wouldnt stick a picture of them front and center on their website but the 2nd time i went there i got this 2999 snow crab special they had  oh my gosh the snow crab tasted so amazing the crab was perfectly cooked the seasoning didnt overpower the sweet taste of the meat that just melted in my mouth  it was fantastic and worth ever cent  im definitely a fan of crabby bills and will be back","3758":"being a vegetarian i have a thing about restaurants serving bland boca burgers and charging me 6 and up luckily for moons that wasnt the case veggie burger was excellent tasty perfectly cooked and paired with a big pile of fries fries are good but not great fresh but slightly undercooked and stuck together probably arent blanched long enough before frying good milkshake which i watched the waitress hand make my service was great and the waitress very attentive pretty expensive for a solo lunch but most of that was the unnecessary but totally worth it milkshake","3761":"i work on vassar st in reno which may qualify as a food desert fast good as far as the eye can see very little freshness therefore i cant say how grateful i am that a place like cafe deluxe is only 5 minutes away   the food here is fresh locally sourced when possible and reasonably priced delicious dishes with or without meat great veggie and vegan options they do togo orders also which is helpful when i need to eat on the run i appreciate their combination of easily portable foods like smoothies sandos and wraps with dining friendly options i like good options whether i stay or go   some dishes to try apple cheddar melt mustard on there is to die for grilled hummus sando flying squirrel   the only reason im withholding that 5th star is because of some service issues ive had some long waits at that counter and there are times the tension amongst some servers is palpable other than that i love this place","3762":"authentic taiwanese food in reno wtf really  found this place as i was scouting places to go during a 2 night weekend in reno this place was not in a crowded area  but off kind of in the middle of nowhere next to like a subway or something   the food wellit was good had the beef noodle soup and it sure did hit the spot you cant beat hot soup on a freezing cold day   my wife had a taiwanese sausage dish it was pretty good as well  next time i come back to reno this is surely a place to visit again   why cant there be these type of places in sacramento gosh","3764":"upland up in carmel here it is new to me so i was excited to try it  loved the champagne velvet  not as large of a selection of craft brews as some places but i like that not as many decisions to make  food was excellent service excellent and the location is very convenient right off 116th street","3770":"crepes were fabulous the location is slightly odd but i guess that is the nature of philly caramel latte was delicious and a very good bang for your buck they also serve juices from rijuice which were very refreshing i would recommend this to any philly new comer","3784":"good and affordable takes me back to the cookies i ate from mexican bakeries in the mission when i was a kid they seem to have 50 cakes cookies and pastries available at any given time the steady flow of people and what appears to be aroundtheclock baking would explain how fresh everything tasted they also do torta sandwiches using cold cuts i believe which are apparently also good and very cheap","3789":"the fudge is awesome fun little spot with some cool features you can listen to old radio soap shows while you dine the service while always kind is sometimes slow","3797":"what a great concept and such delicious and carbalicious food  it was packed on a weekday afternoon to my surprise but that goes to show how well regarded this eatery is  i loved my peach pancakes and the abundant flavored syrups that came with it  big portions but nice to your wallet  very near the vanderbilt campus and some boutique shops where you can walk off some calories after  i cant speak for the locals though there were many eating around us but a perfect stop for a meal in between touristy things","3798":"i love visiting new places and i love trying local brews and wines when i am in those places  we were out and about in saint louis and decided it was time for some beer it is always time for some beer and turned to yelp to find somewhere not anheuser or budweiser to go to that was also close by enter 4 hands brewing  as we drove up the dead end street we saw what we thought were food trucks and i got a little excited but upon closer examination they were popup clothing store truck things also very cool but not of interest to me on that day there is street parking but there is also a decent sized lot across the street from the brewery  it is kind industrial which i like it fits well for a brewery like brad g said if gave me rhinegeist vibes two floors for your local brew drinking needs exposed brick and wood is the kind of vibe going on on the second floor are plenty of community style tables arcade games projection television and another bar if you are floorhopping the pos system is connected between the bars so you can order on your tab at either one  as for the beer they have a nice variety to choose from i dont like ipas and they definitely have more than just hoppy beers fruity beers and soursgosessaisonsshandies are my kind of thing and they had several on hand to sample  i do wish you could get a flight of 4 for the price of a regular beer but the prices are per sample 3 small samples end up costing more than a full pour of something but if i want to try a few different beers without getting wasted itll cost me more also some bartenders were letting some patrons have free samples about half a tasting glass worth before they ordered a full glass of something and others didnt offer it or it was just offered to some customers i would have liked that option and then gotten a full pour of my preferred choice  still if you like beer and you like drinking local 4 hands is a cool place to do it","3800":"its warm gooey chocolate chip cookies at your door when youre in pajamas and its 11pm i mean come on i placed and order online and the order came in 20 minutes oh and they also have chocolate milk and ice cream  yeah i know   do yourself a favor and get the cookie pizza ice cream with a freshly baked cookie is the way to go will you hate yourself tomorrow probably but its pretty awesome you guys","3803":"limited menu but very good food the owner is delightful","3807":"my girlfriend and i just went there saturday night and loved it the food is fresh and very good  plus reasonably priced they had already run out of the crab legs we wanted so we went with another crab dish that was also good the lobster bisque was very good and the shrimp tacos were really great i wish the chairs had backs on them though  we sat indoors and most of the seats are bar stools  so kind of uncomfortable","3813":"great little gelato place in south city very casual and inviting flavor selection isnt the largest but they do get maximum flavors out of the fruits they use they do have seasonal flavors which is nice lemon and rosemary being one of my favorites if it is available not bad pricing either you definitely recommend if you are looking for something cool and refreshing but not as heavy as icecream enjoy","3814":"yes its star spotting sensation and the pancakes and bacon are fabulous but go without the kiddies   your kids wont like the wait  heck im a grown up and i dont like the wait  and once they get to their seats they will be treated to the ohsounspecial treat of having no booster seats but old boxes of sugar to sit on   can you say owner without children  alas if you are going on a weekday earlyish its a darn good eatin joint  ive never had an order that was slow or anything less than what i expected  its worth the extra money  the wait is up to you to decide","3821":"good breakfast spot with all the basics for a reasonable rate well located whether youre staying in the quarter or the warehouse district i had the eggs with bacon and potatoes and toast pretty good although a little oily","3827":"its ok my husband and i love thai food and eat a lot thai foodi had a beef basil stir fry and i dont think wont order again it just not for memy husband had a pad thai it was good but not great  we had stuffed chicken wings for appetizers it was good and different  thai tea was delish place was clean everyone was very  friendly ","3830":"asian fusion they added a few new menu items i always get the mongolian chicken creature of habit i added the pork egg roll this time i like the new touch screen coke machine you can mix any combination to create a soda flavor of your choice","3834":"always great but im always impressed when the employees treat you great when you walk in 15 minutes before closing   my hats off to the closing staff suggesting a new item for my wife to try was great the pad thai is something i now have to try as i return","3839":"this is by far the one of the better grocery store around vail area  selection of diverse product lines and customer friendly workers  i pick this location over the one on 22nd street","3841":"the budweiser tour has always been one of my favorites  the tour is actually very informative and the people are relatively entertaining  being such a huge corporation the tour is very clean and the routes run every 15min in the summer time    the tour is very planned and starts with a history of the brewery which is interesting  then you move on to the clydesdales which are impressive  they take you into the stables and you get to see them getting groomed and get the story behind horses and the farm    next you go into the brewing room and get your free sample bud light or bud  for some reason the beer at the factory tastes betteri personally hate most of bud beer but at the factory its actually palatable  also you get to hear about the barley hops and rice  from there you go to the mixing room and see all the tanks  after that you head back to the brew house and get your last sample  the last sample is a real glass about 20oz of beer so choose wisely    overall a good tour with two free beers  the beer at the brewhouse is cheap if you want to hang around and i like that they serve it in the designated glasses for the type of beer you are getting  also if you checkin on yelp you get a 10 coupon at the gift shop","3842":"thank you mason you made our night the pizza 12 basilpepperoni 12 hawaiian delicious the crust was perfectly browned toppings regulated yet plentiful perfection btw sushi in the side heaven","3844":"went here on a weekday for breakfast the quality was a1 you are eating breakfast in montecito you shouldnt care about how much most things cost i do but i was on a short get away with my wife breakfast was 60 after tip but one of the better right sized breakfasts i have had this is not your beach bum 5 breakfast so dont expect it the banannas foster french toast was excellent and the coffee and oj were top notch the only more expensive and more enjoyable breakfast has been at their sister restaurant luckys down the street","3845":"love this place good service even better queso","3848":"my first instinct is to start this review by saying youre an idiot if you dont go here but that sounds so south philly and judgy then again why change now  the restaurant is rustic and cozy and i dont mean that in the way where im trying to disguise some flaw we recently went to laurel and it was rustic and small and beautiful and elegant but the space just wasnt right to me  servers here should train the rest of the worlds restaurants  knowledgeable attentive friendly  they seem like longtime customers who just decided to work at their favorite restaurant no one likes a hoverer hovering is only appropriate if im on my death bed  the pasta here is the mvp the four of us tried a total of five pasta dishes next time id like to just order the entire pasta repertoire for the table carbovores unite  im sure they would accommodate parties of 6 but i think that would be the limit and if youre a party of two and you were to end up near the door i would feel bad for you i certainly wouldnt sit near the door but you might  im taking off one star because i didnt love the shrimp and cannelloni bean dish nor the bread salad   i also regret not trying the fennelcello digestivo with dessert so im taking a star off for myself as a diner fair is fair","3849":"so yummy there are a million flavor combos both simple and decadent the workers were amazing and you can even taste flavors all of the flavor were spot on and the ice is very fine i will definitely be back","3850":"huge rouses fan all of their employees are helpful and really seem to know what theyre talking about id rather pay a little more for good service and quality food product over somewhere like walmart","3851":"not sure why this place only has 2 12 stars but it was great  happy hour was good  the drinks were delicious  i had the lemon drop and my friend had the bloody mary and they were great  the apps were good and we loved the oxtail service was also great  waiters were very friendly","3853":"the wk cheesesteak was fabulous a lil salty  the rueben cheesesteak was good too   not at boring was fun to eat nothing heavy great service   spoiler alert no free refills but tasty lemonade with rhubarb","3857":"super friendly place nice outdoor seating had the pretzels and beer cheese our server was very nice and attentive","3862":"tried their sushi called heart attack and it is to die for will definitely come back for more the other sushi and shuimai  is pretty average unfortunately","3863":"great little place do not let the size fool you the food is awesome and very fresh","3868":"good service where i used to live the drive thru at kfc took 10 minutes here although there were four cars ahead of me only took 2 or 3 minutes the order was right hot and oh so good","3877":"if i lived in medford and went here on a regular basis it would be great for the playground and feeding zoo but its a little pricy 14 for 1 kid and 2 adults probably worth the annual pass if youre a local","3878":"i am staying at the grand sierra resort in reno and went to look for lunch  i was in the mood  for a burger so johnny rockets appeared to fit the bill  this was my first visit to this chain  i am skeptical about any chain but this was a wonderful surprise   they were very busy but we were greeted by an energetic waitress named lyndel  she was amazing  we felt like we were the only customers in the place  after a few jokes and a smile she took our order  the food came quickly and as perfectly prepared  the portions were large  the burgers fries and milkshake were all better than any chain i had been to  in the end it was a very good experience  my hat is off to lyndel for doing a job so well that it makes a lunch like this memorable","3879":"all around excellent but there are one or two family owned places that serve a better burrito","3882":"we have had the pizza a bunch of times and its always reliable and ingredients are clearly high quality between 34slice is very pricey though i ordered two of their catering trays for a tailgate last month and adam was very helpful in advising how much to get for our group of 30 sandwiches were a huge hit bagels were good too salted caramel brownies gluten free were the best ive ever had if not for the price point theyd be 5 stars","3883":"for suburban chinese food this is definitely decent i didnt feel like anything was overly greasy or battered and the portions were adequate for the money if youre in the area i would give this place a try","3884":"i love cafe du monde this is the first time i tried the famous bengiets at this location and i loved it  i wouldve given it five stars however the only downside it had was theres only one cash register it would seem like there should be an even flow because the orders are already up before you even get to register however there was a large group in front of me and due to only having one cash register there was close to an 8 minute standstill in the line","3885":"just happened to stumble upon this place while walking downtown and just loved it the downstairs area has kind of an old cafeteria vibe with the long table and the upstairs has individual tables for more privacy  if you are wanting a burger with a new spin to it then this is the place plus all of the homemade sauces are delicious","3886":"healthiest lunch option in the cool springs area by far sure there are other places that offer a good salad but grabbagreen really makes sure you cant get distracted by the add ons like that extra brownie for dessert i ordered the gulf of mexico bowl with chicken instead of shrimp everything was fresh and great quality but overall kind of bland the avocado dressing just tasted like a pureed avocado which isnt necessarily a bad thing but if youre looking for a flavor punch that dressing will not suffice if you get chicken its ground meat instead of choppedjust fyi in case you dont realize it when you order i think the ground chicken definitely makes the bowl look more like that classic clean meal prep lunch im sure there are other bowls with dressings that are far more tasty i mean they even have a healthy mac and cheese but when i come here its either the intention to go all the way and eat as many greens as possible   as others have said grabbagreen is a great option if youre really trying to stick to a healthy eating habit or if youre like me you eat here when you feel really guilty for eating a bunch of junk days before there are quick grabandgo items available and fresh made juices and smoothies so its a great option to add to your cool springs lunch rotation","3896":"this is one of my favorite starbucks locations  its large has ample indoor  outdoor seating generally good customer service and delicious coffee   i like that they always have nice displays of their coffee cups and other merchandise you can buy  i have purchased a few gifts for fellow coffee lovers here good place to study  with headphones on  and always love the free wifi","3899":"i was here for the monthly pizza luncheon for my high school class  we do not need to go into what year     i chose to have a cobb salad in the small side size  it was definitely a meal by itself  i also shared in a chicken and spinach florentine pizza which was very good  the crust was a relatively thin one and quite good on its own  service is fast casual  our food came out fairly quickly  and as we were not rushing to leave they came and cleared the dishes when we finished eating","3900":"great scott the second best spicy beef soup of st pete after bich nga excellent food and good clean atmosphere good vegetarian options too the pho is flavorful but not my local favorite a little sweeter than most would come back for the tofu banh mi every time  service can be slow on weekends because of drink orders seasons also sells boba drinks and for this reason it is a local high school hangout","3904":"tre lune is one of my fav restaurants in santa barbaramontecito area they always have wonderful italian food and are very accommodating also i tried a new to me italian white wine falanghina which is lite and fruity","3912":"buffet is probably the best ive had in the area and for only 7 one would really get their moneys worth  i love raita  i could easily put it on anything and thoroughly enjoy whatever i was eating and they do raita the way it should be done here","3915":"my family and i went here for lunch and it was absolutely delicious we had the shrimp tacos crab cakes and fried shrimp and onion ring platter everything was fresh flavorful and cooked to perfection the tacos were my favorite and i wished i lived closer so i could have them more often  we sat inside because it was freezing but on a warmer day the view would be much better outside inside seating is bar style but its still roomy and enjoyable  the service was attentive and friendly and the prices were affordable this is definitely going to be the place to go whenever we are visiting santa barbara  the only reason i didnt give five stars is because the location is a bit small  still 100 worth it though","3922":"i love tjs and this location is no exception the parking lot is always packed if you come monday  friday over lunch though  excellent products especially frozen foods","3927":"love it love it love it  hands down the best price you will find on staples like milk eggs cheese tortilla chips canned veggies  the selection isnt the best and i can rarely get 100 of my shopping done here  however what they do have is fabulous and dont worry about those long lines the cashiers are lightning fast and friendly to boot   pro tips  bring your own bags  bring a quarter to rent a cart  dont be a d return your cart  try the wines especially the glugwein at holiday time  check out the miscellaneous goods aisle especially for birthday gifts  they have millions of kinds of cheeses try them all","3928":"the hubs and i flew into nola late the night before so we crashed near the airport instead of driving to the dell late that meant a morning and afternoon to tool around the quarter before heading home  the hubs brother suggested we drop into this cafe for some eats and to say hello to his wife our sisterinlaw  cute little place  delicious menu  too many choices i saw someones pancakes come out and they looked fluffy and nomworthy but i decided to go with something that had a little more local flavor enter the seafood benedict  yum the crab and crawfish patties were so tasty the biscuit underneath was impossibly light i liked the hollandaise sauce but would have loved it if it had come out piping hot and not lukewarm the hashbrowns that came on the side were waaaayyy too salty for my liking but the hubs had no problem chowing down note to self check his blood pressure  the man ordered shrimp and grits one of our fave things to make at home aka a heart attack on a plate but you go out happy   anyway the shrimp were cooked well not overdone and rubbery the way they can get but i imagine in the crescent city they know how to cook a scrimp he said the grits were perfect  not too runny not too solid his only complaint was the gravy  he said it tasted strongly of worchestershire did i spell that right was overpowering  wed absolutely go back to this place  there were more items id like to try tasty","3934":"real gem coming across this place wraps were delicious it was a cool unexpected find","3941":"i agree with the previous poster that this is one of the best pasta house locations  our waitress erica is always nice and on top of making sure our drinks are topped off before we even ask  the food is always very good  the only drawback is the prices which for the chicken parm i like is 18  if it was a little bit cheaper i would give 5 stars  i do have to say that the portions are large and i always leave full","3947":"my favorite chinese sichuan restaurant in the philadelphia area and worth the one hour drive from center city  ive eaten in china taiwan hong kong and this place is authentic they dont hold back on the spice their menu is extensive and most everything ive tried is good some of my favorites wontons in red chili oil black bean fish fish stew with chili oil cumin beef","3952":"what a pleasant surprise we actually saw this place last time we went to reno but decided to not eat here  im glad we did this time the waitress was really nice and accomodating  we tried sooo many things some things were pretty cheap so we thought it was a small portion but its actually pretty big  the taiwanese burger is actually like a baoa pork belly bao was what we had and it was good but this one was expensive 4 or so but yummy beef pancake yummy free hot sour soup was okay jaja myun  i think thats what it was  it was alright minced pork over rice ordered two of these huge good sweet had lots of leftover mongolian beef good chow fun meh veggies okay red bean shaved ice yummy but normal  overall really satisfying and good used the yelp deal and total for 5 ppl with lots of food was 60 or so  nice nice well definitely be back","3956":"few places can accomodate my strange requests for instance do you have soy milk oh great yes a latte but can you put it in a really interesting mug i noticed bizarre tea cups over there   aside from indulging my proclivities centennial cafe has a great selection of sandwiches and dutifully so breads for said sammies salads and coffeetea drinks that make this a great spot for a casual lunch scenario i had their tuna salad on multigrain baguette and it was the perfect mushy tuna vs perfectlytoasted bread combo my favorite part about this place is the bizarre decor vinyl tablecloths that sent me into a tailspin through timeenvisioning family picnics at my grandmas house think mayocentric everything punch hinged on lime sherbet and ambrosia salad yeah we went there  just a fun spot in general with lots of windows and odd items to stare at during conversational lulls see sorcererbarbershop wind chimewhirlygig thingie if you do indeed visit ill definitely be back for breakfast as the menu included some items that sounded interesting and the latte was a huge success great prices too  lovesies d","3958":"love their fries and sandwiches possibly best fries in town   summer is getting close grab an iced eegees drink and kick back and enjoy three standard flavors pina colada lemon or strawberry are carried daily with a fourth flavor on rotation changing each month","3961":"rusans offers adequate food with reasonable prices i have been there twice in the past three years and found the food  service to be consistent each time the buffet is filling with an assortment of fried  seafood sushi rolls noodles fried rice calamari four other selected dishes of the day vegetarian inaka miso udon soup salad  lightly fried banana rolls if you do not care for the buffet there is an extensive menu of your favorite japanese cuisines  very important tip 1 please note to not waste food from the buffet or you will be charged for what you do not eat there is a sign posted on the buffet  the server was kind enough to inform us as well   tip 2 the weekday buffet is best to get there before 100 pm   tip 3 the parking meters in front of rusan only allows 1 hour intervals for a maximum amount of 100 bottom line save your change as the meter will only count up to 100  anything more it will just take it   now to the physical condition of the restaurant the restaurant is as clean as it gets as i witnessed them disinfecting sweeping  mopping however in all honesty this restaurant could use a makeoverrenovationupgrade the plates and silverware are scratched the floor is scuffed the green tea kettle appeared dingy the female restroom has two stalls with one missing a door and the buffet equipment is worn  outdated   take some comfort that rusans has a 97 health rating as of september 2015 that is visible in the front of the restaurant   the ambience decor cleanliness quality of the food  service are very important to me and that can make or break my overall dining experience they did change their music thank goodness to more pop  classic rock genres   four generous stars as this restaurant has the potential of being a five restaurant however needs major improvements in the areas mentioned above sooner than later","3964":"yummo  how happy i am that i have such awesome vegan food options within walking distance of home the match meat vegan pizza  heaven the curried hummus  a dream come true beer bread  mmm and who wouldnt love the beer   plus bottleworks frequently hosts some fun foodbeerart festivals and the maplewood farmers market  im only giving this a four because the service can be slow","3965":"i come in here often as my office is close by i cant say enough good things about the people that work behind the counter their breakfast platters are all made to order with fresh ingredients their house coffee is bold with a smooth finish which kinda matches my personality just kidding and you can get as many refills as you wish which comes in handy on monday mornings they are more on the pricey side than i would like them to be a blta is 9  but it  is worth coming in for the food and the friendly smiles","3967":"we had a great lunch today the food was excellent as well as the service we really loved that they are dog friendly on the patio great atmosphere we will be back","3969":"i love to make my own yogurt this place has a nice selection of toppings and yogurt to choose from  the price is in line with other similar places it is clean and the staff friendly they have a loyalty program i think for every 10 you spend you get one back","3972":"after a long wait i finally got to check out livery the place was nice didnt have to wait too long to be seated the atmosphere has a nice vibe this is not a place for dinner it is reminiscent of a tapas place if you want a place to grab some drinks and not so heavy food this is the place i went with two other folks we started off with the corn empanada with a spicy ranch sauce and queso empanadas with black bean sauce i actually liked the corn empanada with the black bean sauce better the second round we had brussel sprouts steak empanada and pork al pastor with a corn cake the second round was even better than the first the brussel sprouts and the pastor are a must try in the end i will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu","3974":"since i am not a regular vietnamese food eater i am giving sf 4 stars but in my book it is a 5 as i was wowd this place has been opened 5 months and it was well run the front end and the dining room are decorated for a great ambience food was great  i ordered 3 dishes for my daughter and i the recommended salt and pepper pork chop as well as the special of the day  tomato and bean curd hot pot with beef and the chicken pho  the hot pot was great as served  i added no additional condimentsi love tomato and beef together in any cuisine and it really stayed tremendously hot  it was bubbling under the lid when served  the salt and pepper pork chop was sliced into pieces fried and served with dried red chilis onion and garlic  smelled divine  great spicy tastebeware of bones   the plain chicken pho had a nice mild sweetness to the flavorful broth and was very satisfying  no condiments were served with it like lime wedges  not sure if we needed to ask or if it a regional thing the menu includes traditional chinese food and lower luncheon pricing on a variety of dishes sf kitchen is close to the gsr my home away from home and an even shorter distance from renown hospital unrmom gsr","3976":"very good calzone  chilly in the restaurant  very good service  i recommend the calzones","3979":"this friendlys always has reliably good service and is clean  those are really the only qualities which separate the different friendlies   if youre ever in the mood for a sundae not a bad place to stop","3984":"great sandwiches baked goods and of course their famous tomato pie i also love the homemade spaghetti sauce and meatballs they keep in the freezer  i always end up spending more than i intended when i walked in  staff is friendly and helpful","3986":"two words pecan pralines  this place was so good  i brought tons of it back to philadelphia","4010":"coffee shop with limited but great tasting coffee ample seating area allows many to bring their laptops and use the complementary wifi just pointing out the music is a bit loud if you need to be on the phone  this is the perfect spot to work and  study or get coffee to go the guji and the bouquet latte are my favorite items prices range from 3 to 6 and they offer onsite parking  i wish bandit had food items aside from chocolate chip cookies and that the staff seemed less indifferent and dismissive","4021":"had a great meal here saturday night monks was packed and we wanted some mussels sat outside which seems like the way to go service was on point our server was amazing its like she was reading our minds and she had the perfect balance of attentive but not intrusive  we had a cheese plate to start then i had the mussels which were great  i remember drinking tasty red wine of course so i cant remember what it was also of course  will definitely be back","4023":"i didnt want to risk having a dry burger so i picked bison meat specifically the southern caviar which also contains bacon pimento cheese stout onions and a horseradish remoulade  i didnt pick up on the onions or remoulade the bacon and pimento cheese stood out as the heavyweight topping champions  i have to admit the bison burger was thick and cooked to a nice pink medium i could actually envision my bison roaming around happily in his humane pasture  it wasnt very seasoned but the salt from the bacon and tang of the cheese balanced it out i also liked the hearty seeded brioche bun a side of spicy pickles instead of fries ensured that i could walk out without feeling gross in the stomach area i ended up being way less upset that i spent 13 on a chain burger than i thought in fact i would recommend spending the money on a bareburger burger","4030":"having lived close by this location in my college years i have a fondness to this starbucks because of the memories and will still stop by if im in the area they have a decent drivethru and they make my latte right   apparently starbucks has updated their oatmeal to stone rolled oats that arent quite as good and the baristas are still working out the water ratio my oatmeal was extremely watery on my last visit and i tried to bring it back but the barista told me he put in the right amount but i had to wait 5 minutes ok it had been at least 4 minutes but to give him the benefit of the doubt  i waited another 5 minutes still extremely watery  i get that its new but i wish he would have just gotten me a new one instead of making me wait another 5 minutes oh well my coffee was still good and ill be back if im close by","4032":"i went to culvers with a work group who had all been before and assured me it was fantastic they described it as the steak and shake of up north i was first impressed with how friendly the employees were from the moment we entered and ordered to the person who brought our food they seemed genuinely excited it was my first time and directed me through the fairly simple menu i ordered a simple cheeseburger with fries while my more experienced friends varied with more complex orders im pretty picky with cheeseburgers fast food or not and i was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and size of this one it tasted extremely fresh and the flavors were what i would expect from an approximately 4 burger the fries were hot and fresh and just the type of texture i love there was a coupon for a free ice cream on my receipt which i redeemed the same visit overall i had a great experience it is not someplace i will frequent just do to the unhealthiness of the options but not because of the flavor of the food when the craving for a great cheeseburger hits culvers will most definitely be at the top of my list","4036":"nice nano brewery please go taste their awesomeness buy it on sunday  i forgot i couldnt buy on sunday whats the indy loophole  you can buy alcohol in restaurants wineries and now craft breweries   aptly named after the german form for beer i went to the most inspirationally named brewery bier midseptember i was hoping for some fall inspired beers but i think they were kicking the kegs for summer  whatevs i tried several flavors and ended up grabbing a growler of the whit reminiscent of a hoegaarden or allagash white    their nanolike brewing process is really brilliant  they have different beers every week and i imagine it keeps the locals good and hydrated  the taprooms pretty cool tool lots of space big tv couch darts beer all you need really    only complaint a bit expensive for growlers  but you got a keep a great operation like this going somehow  that is moola   looking forward to trying the pumpkin if i can get it before they run out","4038":"stopped by here one day with my bf and my sister unfortunately they didnt have enough black and white cookies so i didnt get the chance to try it however i did try the cream puffs and the chai mini cinnamon bun the cream puffs were just average but the cinnamon bun was heaven the chai syrup that pooled at the bottom of the bun was so delicious i have previously tried one of their cakes as my friend got me one for my birthday last year it was also pretty damn good it had a thick ganache on the top and light creamy custard on the inside i definitely will be back","4041":"solid truck located in this one alley between 30th st and drexel cucina is a great truck i got their captain crunch fish burrito which was amazing it was very crispy with two large filets of white fish the sauce for the burrito was on point the line is really long so be sure you can wait a while overall this truck has something special and is recognized for it will be back soon","4045":"my favorite place to get tacos from theyre usually pretty good i usually get the carne asada and carnitas and both are very flavorful the reason i say usually is because depending on whos cooking the flavor is a bit lacking i once got the shrimp tacos and was disappointed they were these teeny tiny shrimp that looks like they came from a bag frozen would have preferred them to be bigger my fiance gets the chorizo and he loves it not too spicy the price is good the customer service is ok the young girls that are there dont really talk or smile or anything they look like theyre bored or something others are very friendly overall they are delicious and i would recommend them if youre in the mood for authentic tacos","4048":"ive had a decent amount of trouble ordering over the phone here with several messed up orders but their food is amazing so its not worth passing up their baos are amazing and the popcorn chicken is seasoned with five spice its the best and most affordable quick bite","4049":"had a great lunch with my wife excellent chicken salad sandwich and corned beef fries with the sandwitch would have been nice","4051":"plain and simple these tacos are the bomb  never been disappointed when i visit the west coast taco truck where ever they may be  youll think youre in austin tx home of truck food when you bite in to one of these authentic tacos served the way they should be","4066":"not the best burgers in the city but its my favorite out of the other burgeroriented places in the area they have a large menu with interesting options different meats and milkshakes the hot honey is delicious   they serve some of their chicken sandwiches with funky cuts of meat so if youre a whitemeat only eater then ask before ordering ive had one bad experience with an order and the manager rectified it so theyre fine in my book  have ordered delivery a few times and it always came within their estimated time","4068":"ill be honest the guy offering free popcorn outside the shop had a pretty sweet sales pitch  want some popcorn  thinking  yup  the taste on the street was good  well really good so good that it got me in the building i was not hungry at the time but once i got in there i wanted to taste them all   you can taste as many as you like and after my fourth or fifth variety i realized that there was no way i would be walking out of here without some popcorn   i was okay with that  after a mental struggle with what flavors i wanted to get i mentally limited myself to two i got a white cheddar healthy because cheddar is cheese and cheese has protein and the cookie explosion becausedessert  the prices are reasonable and the popcorn is great just try not the buy some clearly i failed and it was delicious","4072":"the st pattys day cook was leaps and bounds better than the monday cook the clams were great cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches bread is lacking philadelphia style though   good place to go after a game and to watch a game go phils  dont go here to play pool","4075":"reading prior reviews i wasnt sure what to expect  we went for lunch on a friday and were seated immediately   our server was very attentive  the children loved the view of the boats in the marina and their frozen mango drink  the blackened grouper was cooked perfectly as was the grilled crab cake   we had the cleveland oyster appetizer  the oysters were from the texas gulf and were a good size","4077":"love the mahi fish tacos and enchiladas vegetables verde great prompt service and excellent menu","4088":"my first experience there was great the wait time was a little longer than anticipated but it was certainly worth it customer service was great very courteous dinner platters come with two sides i ordered fried tilapia greens yams and mac and cheese tilapia was cooked perfect seasoning was on point greens tender not soggy yams were the icing on the cake for me just like my aunt used to make mac and cheese was pretty good just a tad on the salty side all in all id recommend this place","4091":"the  husband and i went to cappys on a whim  every other time we have wanted to go there they have been closed  i do admit the hours they are open are few but it was worth it we had the italian style pepperoni pizza which is basically ny style so so good there is so much cool stuff there  you wont know where to look first   this is such a cool place   the patio section is so pretty and serene  cappys got a 4 rating from me only because when we were there they had an extremely loud group sitting in the middle  they were awful  aside from that is our new fav  you must go  be careful you could spend a good hour just looking around at all the cool things they have there","4104":"great local place and plenty of delightful concoctions  im a strawberry fanatic so naturally got the creole strawberry  strawberries were all fresh and tasty","4105":"what to get beignets service 45 atmosphere cafe fast take out wait 5 mins saturday 10am for 2 parking large parking lot  the experience july 2016 im no stranger to cafe du mondes beignets in the french quarter so im okay trying other locations further from the original this one is located inside a mall so its relatively spacious and easy to get to theres a huge parking lot encircling the mall so no worries there either  the cafe du monde here is reminiscent of a mall food court level place its a quick service type where you order at the counter and you find your seat to enjoy your beignets and coffee at one of the few tables  if youve never had a beignet youre in for a treat its like a lighter doughnut with a mountain of powder sugar on top very messy youll need a pile of napkins to clean up afterwards eat them while theyre fresh and hot in comparison with the ones in the french quarter the quality is about the same  so if youre looking for the infamous cafe du monde beignet you can try it at further locations less traffic less tourists faster service just the location isnt anywhere scenic but its part of the tradeoff","4106":"after spending almost the entire day on an airplane i was in dire need of some burger action thankfully b was on board so we headed to baileys brian and have been here twice together but many other times separately my usual order is the smoke bomb with a side of small chili cheese fries ill get to these soon enough he doesnt have a usual just whatever hes in the mood for this time around i ordered a medium rare love on the rockschili cheese fries and b chose the medium rare mediterranean sans red curry chevreregular fries   burgers the love on the rocks is a combo of cocoa dusted beef patty whiskey apple slaw cherry jalapeno jam and spicy walnuts although i enjoyed the burger it did not quite hit the spot as well as the smoke bomb typically does the mediterranean lamb patty cucumber relish roasted red pepper roasted tomato red curry chevre was soso and was kind of bland another thing that ive noticed that happens quite frequently here and in other saint louis joints is when i ask for medium rare there is hardly any rare oddly my burger was more on the well done side and brians was actually medium rare burgerwise we dont really feel like the burger lives up to its price and havent been too impressed by any of the burgers weve tried  fries bs not a huge fan of the fries he felt they were a bit soggy but appreciates the variety in sauces i on the other hand think that the chili cheese fries are probably one of the best things i have tried on their menu the cheese chili chives and fries combination work their magic every time for me   ice cream after finishing up our meal b was wondering if he felt like having ice cream i told him yes because a thats how this works and b ice cream is always a good idea and i wasnt wrong we chose a scoop of the pistachio and of the coconut crunch this had to be the best part of the meal for the both of us the coconut crunch has pieces of dark chocolate in it and the pistachio is absolutely delicious this ice cream experience was just magnificent   overall we feel like baileys does a good job in providing a lot of options but does not always live up to the price it charges however chili cheese fries and the ice cream are the clear winners for us      a rating 4 b rating 35","4109":"i checked la c coffee out on a recent visit from dc i liked the coffee but didnt love it and found it annoying that theres no coffee menu like they expect you to know it by heart i felt old which i kinda am and distinctly unhip which i am not   as a side note dont breathe in too deep or youll suffocate from the parfum dhipster","4112":"good burger with crazy good flavor combinations they make their own catsup  you can tell the difference if you arent sure that is a good thing they make their own ice cream  have adult versions as well","4117":"great on a weekday morning small and gets filled quick but thats not a bad thing  everything is great and great staff  i might freak out on some biker if i clip myself on one more pedal get your bikes off the patio  weekend mornings are a mess with the crowds take your chances though worth the wait    bring back the baked pretzels","4121":"definitely one of my favorite coffee shops to go to in the nashville area  its such a cool atmosphere and it provides the perfect get away  whether you go there for a coffee date or just to get some homework done they provide that relaxing and friendly environment  the staff is wonderful and the coffee and food is even better  they also have a great little reward system where you will receive a text that can be redeemable for a free coffee  i would recommend you check them out at least once and who knows you might get hooked","4122":"i was a little sad that the old business thai nakorn closed down in this place so i tried out this business with my boyfriend to see what was up we were greeted well and sat down they had a wide set of options ranging from vietnamese pho to americanized chinese dishes i ordered the oxtail pho and my boyfriend did with the mongolian beef the mongolian beef was really yummy the meat was so soft that it could just melt in my mouth the sauce was just right my order of the oxtail pho was alright as well though i felt like the pho needed a little bit more flavor the meat was tender though which i liked a lot the service can be improved and the ambiance too ill be trying out this place again","4126":"excellent open facility serving all sorts of beers especially summer and fruit infused beers the space is huge for parties and future use they have plenty of bike parking but being on tchop the parking and getting to it by bike is a little shaky i will be back because i really enjoyed all the different wits and ipas i can see a brewery bike tour coming soon","4127":"i went yesterday in the event dinner under the stars and i love it the entree was delicious  the siger make the night pleasurable","4128":"i hate to admit it in pulic but i do like subway this one in particular is nice because the staff is so kind  they seem eager to please wait patiently while i make my selection or try to say goodbye to my father on the phone  they seem interested in making sure i get what i want   the selection at subway is pleasing as it includes salads and sandwiches and lots of yummy cookies  for an inexpensive sandwich in center city this is a good choice","4129":"cool place like 2 totally different places between upstairs and main floor had fun playing skee ball while trying their beers love their guildsman sauvignon blanc will definitely go back only complaint was one rude bartender downstairs","4133":"wandered in on a whim with some friends on a rainy saturday afternoon for a late lunch where pub and kitchen delivered everything that makes a rainy day comforting and cozy versus wet and agitating  we settled in at the bar where i had my samuel smith oatmeal stout and gnocchi with brussel sprouts and sweet potato i think sweet potato idunno i wanted to doublecheck online but wow what a lousy web siteer web page with only a contact link to email my boyfriend had a po boy which was absolutely delicious but equally as delusional if it really thinks its a poboyfishcake on a round bun for 11 feel free to call yourself a delicious homemade fishcake sammich but please recognize that a poboy you aint neither by bread nor by price  aside from the misleading definition of aforementioned boyfriends sandwich and an under construction online presence pub and kitchen is a dimly lit inviting and friendly corner pub where i look forward to spending many a lazy winter saturday afternoon with my ass atop a barstool and when i do ill need to try one of their bloody marys because my mouth watered as i watched the bartender mix a few  ps thank you for not giving us a problem when we split the check 3 ways with 3 credit cardsit was reflected in your cash tip","4137":"even if they forgot the extra seasoning for my rings the staff members who run this place are tops  they work hard and they keep the place acceptably tidy  recommended for a grease feast","4141":"completely reliable for hearty salads i tend to favor the shrimp and avocado salad and the cobb fresh ingredients that are easy to customize as its all made to order except if you want to take advantage of their modest grabngo cooler which is a sweet option for when you are stumped about dinner the atmosphere is nothing to write home about and i think better sandwiches can be found elsewhere but for a nice salad for lunch or a carry out dinner this is a great chain","4143":"was here over labor day weekend so yes the place was packed and there was a long line we decided to order at the window and eat on the tables located on the pier the long was line and we did wait a long time but once we ordered the food didnt take as long as i thought its pricey but its seafood and worth it we ordered the lobster sandwich calm chowder and a side of onion rings the lobster sandwich was amazing they look small but trust me its loaded with a ton of lobster and was super filling the clam chowder was good as well as the onion rings but the lobster sandwich is a must try","4154":"made reservations and came to dinardos before walking to a performance at the arden theatre  walked in a bit just before 600 pm and were seated at once not before engaging the bartender in conversation that resulted in a delicious mojito  we advised the maitre d that we had an 8 pm theatre function and they took pains to ensure we walked out on time    after a delicious plate of calamari i enjoyed a broiled seafood melange and my partner had the surf and turf  both were absolutely awesome  we washed it down with a superb pinor noir  casual pleasant with good food and superb service","4155":"the food was really good today the drive was worth it the gyro platter was good the greek  salad was really fresh","4164":"when it comes to food trucks  they have it down to a science things i love about kbop 1 everything on the menu is good 2 super quick friendly service 3 good prices  the only thing that gets me each time is consistency since ive tried almost everything once ive come to realize my favorite menu item is spicy tofu which btw is only 7 for a huge portion every time i order it however its different sometimes with just white rice which i think is how its supposed to come based on the menu descriptions sometimes with vegetables sometimes doused in spicy deliciousness sometimes not as much sauce   but that isnt as big of a deal because like i said everything is fantastic the portions are huuuuuge for the price this food truck is my goto","4167":"clean location and fast friendly service no indoor seating but a small amount outside small parking lot everything is always great here","4168":"we took pizza home the first time and ate in the restaurant for our second visit the pizza is thin crust and cooked in a gas fired oven similar in style to wood fired pizza ovens the pizza is very good the gf crust was ok and the salads average one very noticeable thing for me was the lack of a recycling bin for the plastic and glass containers we took all our recycling home please provide recycling at your restaurants","4169":"good spot  we come here about once a month   good pizzawingsbeer  wed they have all u can eat crabs  large portions and decent prices","4171":"great setting and environment porch with a roof to accomodate for hot raining or weather affected days good food for a barpub but not amazing dog friendly but there will be dogs with different tempers there free wifi but very spotty","4172":"ted drewes seems to be a local hangout in st louis  i was in town for a couple of days with friends i knew and they took me to ted drewes claiming it was a must see in st louis  its pretty tasty but i dont understand why its the attraction that it is  their custard is delicious but its rivalled by other ice cream and yogurt places  their combinations are delicious though  if you want to get a taste of st louis and great custard youve got to visit ted drewes","4173":"the food here is legit my mother in law is thai and ive spent some time in thailand so i can spot overamericanized thai food from a mile away thai legacy is pretty authentic even my mil gave it her seal of approval weve gotten take out twice and both times got different dishes we have yet to find something that isnt good the pork in basil garlic sauce and the yum woon sen have been my two favorites so far try this place out if youre a fan of thai food you wont be disappointed","4182":"terrific find off the beaten path in nola great seafood and italian specialties  the mussels appetizer was fabulous","4184":"my vegan girlfriend and i came here for vegetarian reasons and were happy with the vegetarian bourbon chicken we had  the service was kinda slow and meh but thats kinda par for the course at a hipsterpunk restaurant  they always have better things to do but never do them either","4186":"good food  same consistent quality from chipotle now in reno nv  i would be willing to bet that the opening of this restaurant will be the closing of qdoba and baja fresh","4191":"good food and friendly staff cant go wrong here for good barbeque dont feel shy about bringing the kids or some friends cause even though its a small place the seating is nice and comfortable","4192":"we always enjoy eating here coffee is exceptional and helps to pass the time as they get very busy i recommend reservations on the weekend","4199":"stopped in again for a second visit we got there at 815 on saturday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 5 after we arrived the line grew rapidly by the time we ordered it was around the corner of the building and down the sidewalk the service and food were good my husband loves the breakfast medley with the perfectly good hash browns and over easy eggs i also recommend the chocolate sin and sweet potato pancakes next time im going to try the french toast it looked delicious","4201":"a very good place to bring a family with children andor family members who survived the 1950s this place is filled with a bunch of memorable and a large train train track with functioning train the pizzas are phenomenal i have had the pleasure of indulging in both new york and chicago style pizzas","4202":"i got the small banana pudding concrete with hot fudge and it was delicious the custard and hot fudge were very creamya little too much for liking i recommend trying atleast once","4204":"i agree with most of the reviewers about this place  i met up with my date here and we were quite comfortable in this quiet cozy joint in queen village  we sat on comfy chairs that made us feel like we were at home  they even have 2 bathrooms one small and other large that was convenient  parking is problematic in this area and i was lucky to get a free legal spot mostly due to coming in on sunday afternoon  i ordered one of the 2 coffees they offered  they were both roasted and even though  im not a fan of roasted coffee i needed my coffee fix  it was pretty good although im still not a fan of roasted coffee and it got lukewarm quickly  i should have asked the man to heat it up  id recommend going here one a short date or just to meet a few friends  however next time ill probably try the bubble tea like my date or get hot tea","4208":"fun environment great service delish food i love having a quirky and reasonable dining option  downtown this would be such a great summer restaurant spot dont hold this against me st louis but id choose this over fitzs ","4210":"the woodrack caf\u00e9 officially opened their doors last week a welcome addition to the mckernan and queen alexandra neighbourhoods just south of garneau 109th is a busy street so theres no doubt that commuting edmontonians have driven past the new storefront wondering when they could grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the space its finally here  im not sure why i was expecting a small shop the corner unit is expansive with numerous seating areas catching up with a friend is ideal on the couch and in front of the fireplace or perhaps a small table to set up a work or studyspace or if youd like to chat to coowner kristy nicknamed shammy by friends and family sit alongside the bar and watch her make up your coffee  since i entered through the 76th avenue entrance the first thing that caught my eye was the take a book leave a book shelf space already filled to the brim with all kinds of reads next the incredible reclaimed wood pieces from local alberta farms upcycled as art and decor to display the woodrack caf\u00e9s homemade jewelry antler art and boho crafts which are all also for sale upcycled wine glasses mugs handmade in victoria if you like it its probably for sale  rounding up to the main entrance and counter i got pretty excited to see a display case full of whoopie pies and with fallinspired flavours to boot who wouldnt want a pumpkin pie carrot cake or chai whoopie to go along with their drink the crazies thats who their menu online also states that puddings dark chocolate salted rice puddings and bread puddings will be available as well as treats like duffins so help me if spellcheck doesnt let that one through its a doughnut and a muffin having a delicious baby brookies a brownie with a big spoon of cookie dough and butter tarts the amount of crossbreeding between pastries is enough to get you wideeyed and drooling all thanks to inhouse chef tracy or mama t  coowner melissa was up front and center manning the front when i visited last wednesday with a background in business the new development space was a perfect but challenging match for them to open up shop set out to launch in summer 2015 construction and tailoring the space for the kitchen became the main cause of their delay id like to say though that it was all worth it the open concept kitchen inviting and the details of the tintiled ceilings and woodpaneled floors all coming together to create a warm space   alongside the whoopie pies and assorted pastries the woodrack caf\u00e9 is serving up two kinds of brews local edmonton roast ace coffee roasters and one all the way from the east coast anchored coffee from dartmouth nova scotia having never tried anchored coffee before im excited to try the lighter brew next time im in woodrack for last weeks visit i opted for one of their espressobased drinks instead the danesi caff\u00e8 rome italy latte is always a sure way to go  oatmeal and soups are available for now but woodrack hopes to add sandwiches and heartier meals as they ease their way into things currently their hours are monday to friday 730am to 430pm with goals of extending their hours to 7pm to accommodate the afterwork crowd and weekends baby steps for now but im hopeful it will happen soon  with only a few days tucked underneath their belts it was a pleasant surprise to see the space full of people and from different walks of life a concept true to what kristy and melissa had wanted they hope to bring people in and stay in never feeling rushed and pressured to leave fostering a sense of community is in all honesty one of the measures of success for a caf\u00e9 by the looks of how things were going i could tell this wasnt a grabandgo kind of space you can also tell that the woodrack caf\u00e9 had thought this through theres builtin plugins at the counter  if youve been following me youll know that i am always excited for a new caf\u00e9 and quadruply not a word i know as happy when its a local business supporting local products and art i also love spaces where i can relax order a drink and a bite to eat every hour of course and type away willynilly on my laptop heres to another fantastic space and to the expansion of edmontons coffee culture cant wait to come back to the woodrack caf\u00e9 check out their menu expansions and a new brew im also crossing my fingers that there will be a duffin or brookie waiting for me or even a tarduffin thats a butter tartmuffin obviously","4212":"this place has moved around a few times im glad its closer to where i live now  the bread is great get it and make it with your breakfast it pulls apart into little bun shape rolls that is perfect for toasting or dunking   the sweet breads are just as good  they have a shell sweet bread and a kiss sweet one that is my top picks   the tongue is more like a cookie wafer crossed with a light sweet churro its a nice snacking one  butter loaf and bundt same buttery dense bread but in two forms these are good as is which is a little sweet but very tasty i take it and fry it on a pan with butter yes i go there with it and make it like a corn bread dessert  they have day old bread which is still perfect for the next few days stop by and ask questions if you have any the workers are always super friendly  oh tamales yeah they have them give them a call when theyll have them and come get them  they are guatemalan style so its made with banana leaves instead of corn husks much more most than youd get elsewhere  plenty of parking lots of choices perfect for just picking up a few sweet buns or a few breads for dinner","4220":"good service and food we went close to closing but still got awesome service the chips were alright we have had better chips in other locations","4221":"i cannot express how much i love trader joes and this location definitely lives up to the franchises reputation great staff very clean and easy to get around my only complaint is the large population of selfabsorbed customers i dont think that this venue encourages that behavior but i do blame this occurrence on the location from the parking lot to check out if you arent willing to elbow someone for a banana be prepared to get trampled","4224":"the service was great and the atmosphere of the place is definitely a place i would just bring my friends or a even a date too the dessert was alright but i definitely like the blueberry lemonade they had","4226":"ive been a huge fan of phat bites since they were in their previous location and long before food network featured them the food is different but delicious the funky vibe is fun and its one of the few places i feel 100 comfortable going to eat at alone   a majority of the time i order the meat and 2sides especially if i am in a hurry i always get the southwest chicken salad and the spicy noodles my second side is different every time but im super loyal to the first two i used to always ask for it togo because i couldnt finish the plate and it made for a wonderful snack later in the day quick easy and a great value   the last couple of times ive gone however i dont get nearly as much food as i once didive gone from wow what a great value to eh didnt get as much food as i paid for im still giving 4stars because im not sure that im being unfair comparing it to years past and not considering the changing climate of the nashville economy because over all if you want a unique dining experience  definitely check out phat bites","4230":"we made our way all the way to the end of the pier and added our name to the wait list after a 45 minute wait we finally got to our table outside the view was amazing and although it was windy and a bit cold the heaters above our table helped keep us comfortable   the santa barbara shrimp cocktail was just a standard shrimp cocktail nothing spectacular i had the crab sandwich it was good but would have been better slightly warmer  my husband had the rock crab special which came with a caesar salad and clam chowder the clam chowder was excellent he usually adds pepper but said it came seasoned just the way he liked it  the crab was great too a great deal and very high quality  our son had the chicken strips he ate 3 out of 4 of them which means they must have been good  we had a pitcher of firestone they actually have a very good selection of beers on tap as well as by the bottle  the location is very casual the inside consists of more bar like and stool seating there are 4 actual tables outside with clear views of santa barbara  the food is high quality and very much worth the price other than a long wait it was a great experience","4231":"the people that work here are so rude however the donuts are fantastic every time i have come and asked one of the ladies a question at the register you would have thought i just asked for her to come fan me and feed me donuts super super rude no smile rolling eyes hey lady with the glasses if you are so miserableget another job lucky the donuts are good coffee is terrible though","4234":"i went back for dinner and was impressed again by the size of the portions  there was live music performed on a saturday night that was pleasant and upbeat    we shared the cold appetizer sampler traditional hummus eggplant and giant fava beans and dolmades  delicious and the dolmades are perfect among 4 people which was a good starter   i loved the special whole bronzino wrapped in grape leaves but not as much as the whole dorado that i had at kanella  i did not love the grilled calamari as it was probably too fresh from the sea for my taste  i am not accustomed to this style  i like mine cooked through and sliced in rings rather than large soft tenderized whole pieces there were 4  this may be a traditional greek style of grilled squid but i wasnt open minded enough for its mushy texture    personally i thought the horiatiki salad could have used more cucumbers and tomatoes and less green peppers and red onions however it was refreshing and tasty all the same    reservations for weekend dinners are probably a good idea i was told that it was a slow night at kuzina by sofia because there was a famous greek singer performing in ac that evening yet there was but one table free at 7 pm    though i enjoyed my  food from my first visit for lunch far better kuzina by sofia still gets 4 stars from me for dinner based on the kind service their welcoming accommodation to disabled persons cleanliness and the fact that sofia smiled at me","4237":"was in mood for some fried chicken while at riverwalk so decided to try canes hot fresh pieces good size and flavor not a lot of breading and crispy the crinkle cut fries were also good the food court area is clean and orderly like the rest of riverwalk","4241":"we really enjoyed our breakfast the menu is different but still offers the basics great cocktail and mimosas menu french toast was delicious as well as the eggs and homemade jelly bacon was outstanding","4244":"was in philly and saw this small spot and decided to try it jerk chicken was great but expect atleast a 15 minute wait","4247":"outstanding tofu skewers and the miso ramen two ten jack you have your work cut out","4251":"since i was just chatting about this new bakery over on twitter i guess ill finish my review  the space is small and they do have dine in tables but no liquor license if youre here for brunchbut they do have mixers im told if you bring your own  the staff was courteous and prompt   but on to the important stuff the 1 croissant bites are genius they melt in your mouth with buttery deliciousness but still have a bit of a crunch on the edges i hate a mushy croissant i also tried the mixed berry and apple turnovers they were perfectly sized and the mixed berry was clearly the winner being tart and not too sweet the apple was good to but the berry was amazing  as im not a coffee person i got a perfectly tasty iced tea and was out the door  the one thing that is lacking is their signage maybe its building rules or maybe they just havent gotten there yet but blink and youl miss them they are riverside on magazine between general pershing and milanso dangerously close to home  ill be back soon","4252":"treated a new friend to lunch at spot burger today and all i can say is it definitely earned me some cool points food was better than before got plain fries as opposed to cheese fries and was much happier my friend was just flabergasted she thoroughly enjoyed the meal my only gripe is i cant seem to find their menu online anywhere i really wanted to try something different but i didnt wanna spend 5 mins on the phone inquiring about the menu to do so spot burger guys if your menu is online somewhere please direct me to it so i can try more of it","4257":"besito is really good i was expecting run of the mill americanized mexican cuisine but they have some real yucatecan food and some central mexican food they have michelada a beer with tomato juice very traditional and jamaica pronounced hamika and tamarindo i studied abroad in merida and these beverages made me very happy","4259":"good beer nice staff if youre looking for something to do on a weekend check this place out","4260":"so good not very healthy but i cant resist the orange chicken broccoli beef and grilled teriyaki chicken and this is coming from a chinese girl  heres a tip each time you order complete the survey on the back of the receipt for a free entree next time you come if you keep doing this youll get an endless cycle of free entrees ","4261":"midtown spirits is truly like a candy store for craft cocktail enthusiasts  they have a fantastic selection of hardtofind liqueurs and an especially robust selection of highend rum bourbon etc  next door is a beercigar store that was the first place in town i found the full lineup of fee bros bitters and luxardo maraschino cherries only 17 a jar  the one issue that i have is that aside from their specials the pricing is too high  61 for yellow chartreuse  seriously  everyone else on the planet sells it for 45 at the high end  ive run into a number of situations where they were way off on pricing over the years    they do have wonderful customer service on the liquor side not so much on the beer side and truly seem to be passionate about the products they sell  as a matter of fact id probably have given them a 3 star if it wasnt for how good the service is  basically to stock your bar with the basics hit frugal mcdougals for anything you cant get there go to midtown","4263":"i had been reluctant to try this place because i had several bad experieinces at the eatery that used to occupy this space and was afraid that perhaps they had just tried to rebrand themselves as enzos  well in the mood for a chicken cutlet with some greens i decided to give it a try the sandwich was pretty good and they have the mexican sodas coke sprite and fanta orange at a very reasonable price for center city standards  the availability of sodas out of glass bottles and made with real sugar instead of corn syrup plus the good sandwich is probably enough to make me a regular visitor at least every couple of weeks  if you dont already know about mexican sodas do yourself a favor and go find one why not stop here and pick up a chicken cutlet sandwich and wash it down with a delicious and refreshing soda in a glass bottle made out of real sugar","4265":"always great food and drinks and the cookie desert is incredible my kids love this place   service is always average or below average  thats my only complaint","4266":"good beers and decent food  good spot for catching a drink with friends although it might get pricey compared to other options in the area  can get crowded after work so watch out for the yuppies","4268":"wicked fast pizza from order to eating was seriously 7 minutes prices arent bad either about 8 for a do it yourself unlimited toppings the pizza is decent customizable so you can make it to your taste the crust is plain no seasonings but its nice and light sauce is very mild they go very very light on the toppings so i found i had to request extra of nearly everything over all i think its a great quick bit works well for travel with a small person who eats only when he wants what he wants id go back","4269":"theres only one reason i come here birthday cake ice cream  where else am i going to get crazycolored chocolate chips in ice cream and the fact that they make malt shakes as well as regular milkshakes is a plus and thus far service has been pleasant on all my visits here including with my colleagues and our professors though they really need to fix that door if they havent already  i really cant tell you if they really are more than just ice cream since i havent had anything but ice cream here reading some of these reviews does prevent me from sampling the establishments nonicecreamrelated offerings  perhaps one day i will be brave enough  disclaimer review rating based on ice cream and shakes","4270":"k  s is surprisingly much larger on the inside than it looks  they do have a great selection of fruits and vegetables with good prices  my main reason for going was to look for bento boxes to pack my childrens lunches  unfortunately they did not have any but i bought so glass containers instead","4271":"fresh flavorful healthy and a great selection of items to customize my meal the way i want  that is why i come to qdoba  fast food at its best  better than most area mexican restaurants and on par with  those upscale tacorias that keep popping up  the line was out the door today but everyone waited patiently for their turn to create a lunchtime masterpiece i waited about 10 minutes before it was my turn today i ordered a taco salad to go  my server was deep in concentration as he ensured perfection of the salad the lime tequila chicken was moist refreshing and flavorful fresh cilantro and pico were fantastic lots of romaine and a few shredded chips on top and dont forget the guacamole and a little queso want a salad all for 790 i can see the ingredients are fresh what a great deal  they have also added shrimp and roast brisket to the menu options and some fancy hipster tacos  i completed the survey on my checkout receipt for free chips next visit they care what i think the only thing that would make qdoba better would be margaritas or some good craft beer for the dinner menu","4274":"service was fast an great manager jumped on register bring my water up the just of my order for cheaper bill because the way i ordered it wouldve been more expensive fast friendly smile from everybody even the one that wasnt happy to be at work food a little llackluster but other than that great place to go","4276":"love corropolese tomato pie been eating this stuff most of my life and im pretty sure its been the same exact product that whole time why mess up a good thing i guess for those of you looking for regular pizza this is not the place maybe head over to bravo next door for that here they serve cold square tomato piesthinnish crust with tomato sauce and a sprinkle of grated parm on top this stuff is great any time of day especially a morning after drinking if you dont feel like cooking somethin they do a variety of toppings on these pies i prefer the original with just sauce but they also do one with mozzarella and peppers that is quite tasty too","4283":"nice cafe in lakeview  theres a cigar bar next door and a few tables outside to enjoy them  look for a  short bald guy chainsmoking and tell him i said hi","4286":"great established bakery for cannolis prepared fresh slices of pizza cakes and bread quality is very good and prices very reasonable","4287":"im a nofrills coffee person i typically drink it black preferably in a paper togo cup  if youre looking for the opinion of a coffee expert i cannot help you  but i can say that this is the best coffee in fishtown tastewise the flavors are just delicious the hook brings you back","4288":"we came here because the subway down the strip was packed and we definitely made the better choice  i got the 5 piece chicken strips with honey mustard and fries the chicken strips are huge i couldnt finish them and barely touched the fries it was very good though next time i would try a different sauce and side","4293":"being a vegetarian naturally i was excited to try this place out it just may be one of my favorites but i cant say for sure until ive tried some of their other menu items i had the vegan alfredo bowl today made with zoodles zucchini noodles which i have to say wasnt as amazing as i had hoped it was more on the watery and bland end but definitely something different than your typical mushroom alfredo im not sure how they make their sauce but my mom makes alfredo sauce out of cashews and if you do it right you can still get a creamy texture anyway my boyfriend ordered the bison burger which came with a side of your choice he said it was pretty goodthe bun is not bread but what appears to be a healthier alternative the portions were a little smaller than we both expected but i like that bff cafe offers fuelpacks theyre like little lunches to go and they have different sodas offered using agave overall i liked it but i wouldnt say i loved it","4294":"this place  got great reviews so we thought we would stop by we were a little put off by the location and the building as it is obviously an old bob evans dont let these things distract you from the excellent food inside the pho and banh mi were both great and i had another noodle dish with chicken and peanuts that was tasty the biggest bowl of pho is a lake of the servers were friendly and fast and adequately attentive   i like seeing local restaurants takeover the buildings of old chain restaurants this is especially true when the new restaurant beats the pants off of whatever corporate place was there beforehand","4296":"goodsized location with indoor and outdoor seating options usual chipotle efficient high quality great food love this place  love that they satisfy vegetariansvegans and carnivores alike","4300":"i love this place because i can have almost any weird flavor imaginable","4307":"had a great time playing the penny and nickel slots its a big casino with lots of different slot machines to choose from they had many new games and also some older games so it was a nice mix the staff was very friendly and also very helpful when i had a problem with a malfunctioning ticket redemption machine i even walked out a winner would definitely return when im in the tampa area","4308":"great little place ordered the pastor tacos and the chicken empanadas i loved the tacos and the fact that they put pineapples in the taco which really enhanced the flavor of the pastor i thought the empanadas were okay i probably wouldnt get them again the service was good and you do have to find street parking","4311":"great selection good service and cant complain that i have gone before and gotten free pint glasses for buying a case of beer","4312":"my favorite food truck in drexel area the line may be long and makes you freeze in this weather but the food is totally worth it i had the cap n crunch tilapia burrito short rib and chicken satay tacos and they were all good the chicken katsu here is just ok nothing very special and the consistency of this mayb off sometimes my first order the rice was very soft and mushy and the second time it was kinda dry so i just come here mainly for the tacos and burritos and they never disappointed","4315":"theyre open through the growing season which means julyjanuary they make cider continuously from first apple harvest through january fantastic local apple cider from adrian orchards we go every fall  every fall  and we have their cider every year  apples are the star of the show but its not just apples  theyve got lots of other stuff","4320":"i really wanted to try gooey butter cake a st louis tradition i started at claytons across the street but they only sell whole cakes not cake by the slice who does that nowadays in the age of modernity i then went to this place across the street and thank you fellow yelpers for not failing me  i bought a slice of cake to go 244 including tax and wow the cake was a subtle sweet light and airy although covered in powdered sugar the sugar was not overpowering at all and just right the cake true to its name was a bit crunchy on the outside but not so hard youll break your teeth and gooey in the middle the crunchy topping was an added texture bonus what an absolute delight  inside the restaurant was clean warm and inviting the smell of freshly baked breads will slam into your face like a pie throwing contest and its a wonderful feeling i will definitely return","4323":"after returning from france i was absolutely dying for a decent croissant lucky for me la patisserie chouquette came to the rescue all of the pastries we tried were delicious the croissant and the pain au chocolat we both super high quality real french style treats you simply cant find that quality in mot bakeries granted the cost was quite high making this a special occasion treat instead of the every day event it was in france but overall i highly recommend this place for really quality pastries","4324":"best tacos ive had in a long time this will now be my go to taco place when im craving mexican food the prices cant be beat and whether you get the seasoned beef chicken or steak tacos they are all the same price my wife got the burrito and it was huge and was presented very well we will definitely be back and ive even told some friends that we will need to go","4325":"the food at qdoba is always great the staff at this location was also great i got the bowl with chicken it is just the right amount of food at the right price the decor in this location is modern and has a nice rustic feel i will definitely come back to this location again","4329":"i heard on thu that this place opened that day i wanted to go for a pretheatre dinner the next nite but couldnt find out from their website if they served food or even if they were open they dont answer their phone or have a recorded message so we just went glad we did because the beer and food were good service was spotty but hopefully they will iron out those kinks a little odd that an eastern europeanthemed pub doesnt have an ris but maybe they will in future","4330":"i like a bar with some kitschy theme this place gets at least 2 stars for taking provincial surroundings wooden tables candelabras with real candleswax and pairs it with the boilermaker  beer with a side of whiskey to be sipped with your beer and not shot i also like a boilermaker so this place was like a little sliver of heaven for me  it was hot in here but it seems everywhere this summer is all kinds of hot so i really cant complain the drinks were fairly priced and the service was just fine i didnt try the food because nothing on the menu really appealed to me thats the only major drawback i saw  i am sold on the boilermaker idea  its what scores this place that extra star that makes it more than aok","4332":"when reviewing places like ted drewesand by that i mean places that everyoneeveryoneeveryone says you have to try because its a saint louis thingi dont really know where to begin so as a saint louis nonnative im trying to review td based solely on their goods and service is the custard good noits great they have lots and lots and lots of options and they have more than just frozen custard concretes to choose from they have a variety of sizes so whether youre wanting a wee taste or youre manically craving it theres a proper size available for you the service is so much faster than i anticipated when you drive by ted drewes or look at pictures of the lines online you might think screw the wait ill just hit up dq but they have a whole row of windows where at least half a dozen servers are popping theirs heads out and getting stuff taken care of so dont let the hoards fool you the prices are perfectly reasonable and they accept both cash and credit the only issue is they dont have much outdoor seating and custard melts fast so youve got to head home pronto stand around outside or sit inon your car   so in the end i say this go for the kitsch factor go for the good custard or go for the fastandfriendly serviceno matter what just go itll be worth it on a number of levels","4334":"ill definitely go back  this is a breakfast and brunch place that is right out of someones pinterest board its a tad hipstery but very charming chalk board wall faux fireplace cutequirky touches everywhere the food was very good and the chef himself came out to ask how everything was it was busy the morning we went but we sat on the patio so there was no wait  the staff was friendly and the food arrived quickly","4344":"i love me some sprouts now that the hype has died down a little  its much more pleasant to shop there   disclaimer  i only do my produce shopping here because they dont have a huge dry grocery selection so yes i go to two supermarkets for my grocery shopping but its worth it because of the price and quality of the product 31 avocados 199 lb grapes 59lb bananas how could you go wrong all of the produce is so fresh  it makes publix produce look old we tried doing our regular weekly grocery shop there but they just didnt have the brands or variety publix has but the produce selection is enough to keep us coming back   the staff is friendly and helpful and they have a nice big parking lot i also love they have two kinds of grocery carts traditional ones and also the shorter double stacked ones","4346":"great tour lots of different nawlins favorites mixed with a side of history a perfect combo and quantity of food and local lore","4347":"this market offers all sorts of foreign ingredients if you need rice noodles soy sauce etc they probably have it here this is not a fancy supermarket but its fascinating to walk around through the aisles to see what they offer  theyve remodeled recently and are now offering more items","4350":"i absolutely love this cafe  when i first moved to philly 2 years ago i lived right across from this place and would stop by on my way to classes to grab a coffee  not only are they only 150 and you can get a refill for 50 cents they have amazing pastries my favorites are the almond croissants blueberry tarts and pain au chocolat  i also buy the afrique beans for my french press at home and it is just as delicious  a few times the coffee hasnt been perfect or the cappuccino not as awesome but the european atmosphere and the eclectic clientele make up for it  there is no wifi and the tables are small but i still can get some work done in here and prefer to meet up with friends here since its pretty big and theres always a free seat  there are very few working plugs so bring a book if your laptop battery doesnt last very long  also the iced coffees here are amazing  only 2 and they always put a shot of espresso in it  they also accept cash or credit card no matter how small the bill is","4354":"the food was very good  what we iiked is that the chicken fajitas were not over salty  portion was perfect for the price nice crowds at the bar area  definitely not a place to pass  enjoy","4355":"overall i would highly recommend we used josefs for a dessert table at our wedding in incline and it was fabulous   i had trouble finding a local bakerypatisserie to do the job because i had to plan the wedding from southern ca and the fact that there are very few options as well sonja the owner was able to arrange a meeting with us and do a great job with just 10 days notice  there are desserts that are better than others but that was the great part of having a meeting with a tasting beforehand the only dessert i did not care for were the eclairs we had the premium line cookies petit fours a french wedding cake creme puffs towercroquembouche fruit tarts mini pies mini cakes and napoleons i have not tried the deli food but it looked delicious and the restaurant was busy when we went to our meeting","4357":"no better way to start your day  joel bartenderserver extraordinaire was charming  that comment extends to all staff  beni and duck hash were scrumptious and creative  coffee was hot and not as strong as i would like but good  tempted to try the sweets  visually enticing but had no room  perfect ambiance i will be back","4361":"elm cafe serves the best sandwiches in the city  actually if i were ranking my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever items from elm cafe would make the list several times  their creative combinations of flavours using impeccably fresh ingredients have on numerous occasions left me almost dizzy with delight after partaking of such savoriness and oomph    the only downsides to elm are the space itself serious lacking in elbow room and the attitudes of the staff seriously lacking in tact and general courtesy  i probably would go to elm more often but i dont particularly want to have to endure a long wait only to endure bad hipster attitudes  but the sandwiches are outstanding really truly outstanding","4370":"took a break from thanksgiving shopping and ate with my mom and auntie   for a fast food spot it definitely had this homey charming restaurant vibe the layout out of entrance ordering at the counter self service fountain drinks  its got a very local vibe for a fast food spot   i can dig it thumbs up","4374":"at barnetts its all about convenience  i lived behind barnetts for about a year and a half and it was great having a place to pick up beer and other essentials  they have a really nice nonalcoholic beverage selection as well as a deli the staff is also friendly and tend to remember you especially if you frequent it like i did i always felt safe going there which is important in this area  the hours would be the only thing i would change they close at 8 pm on weekdays and at 4 pm on saturday also they are closed on sundays which was a bummer   barnetts is more than aok in my book in fact i still find myself stopping here when visiting friends in the neighborhood the convenience got me there but the selection and staff kept me hooked  i cant quit you barnetts","4376":"the soup of the day is potato spinach and it is really good i havent been to josefs in  a long time and it looked completely different inside it was much more roomy and it no longer looked as if 2 stores were pasted together   i was greeted quickly by a server which i always appreciate and found an empty table to sit at  my favorite lunch has always been the curried chicken salad sandwich because it is always good the combo of soup and sandwich was a perfect size and i got a cookie for dessert   it is good to see a reno landmark that is still doing well next time im in the area i will definitely go back","4385":"all good here good fresh food and tasty shakes stays open later than other eateries inside gsr attentive friendly service pretty simple straight forward car hop menu the basic burger and fries are a safe choice can be busy with long waits at peak hours service levels good for all things considered parking can be problematic","4386":"nice but expensive supermarket if you live in center city and you dont have a car it is a convenient place i am there 12 times per week","4390":"ate here today the orange chicken was over cooked so it was hard i went around lunch time the rest of the food was good it is a hit and miss with the consistency here food here is still good though staff is friendly a few tables needed to be cleaned off i cleaned my own table off floors looked cleanoutside looked clean","4392":"i am a fan of starbuck but i dont drink coffee i go in for the green iced tea yes i love it i also have a few snacks while i was at this one most all are the same good service and good drink","4397":"i pass citi market almost every evening and stop in every week or so for a made to order wrap i like both the veggie and nonveggie options both tasty and reasonably priced i dont buy many groceries here but i usually pick up a few things that i need the staff has always been friendly which is another reason i like giving them my money","4398":"when you scan the yelp reviews for kanella it looks something like this  brunch brunch brunch brunch brunch cyprus breakfast brunch brunch brunch brunch brunch delicious brunch  and id say thats pretty accurate  rather than boring yourself with reading the details just go","4410":"all starbucks coffee and food is pretty much the same at every location so this review is solely about the service which is top notch   i have been going to this starbucks on average 3 times a week before work in the morning for the past 2 or 3 months i always have the same baristas who are super friendly and genuienly nice the service is incredibly fast too   the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars is because they havent learned my order or name yet every morning they still ask for my order along with my name to write on the cup they recognize other customers why not me i desperately yearn to be a regular","4412":"the gelato is spot on i havent been to italy but i hope this is what its like over there too  their dark chocolate in particular is straight up sin  their sugar free hazelnut is excellent  i wish theyd do more sugar free flavors  the reason i docked them a star is because their venue is cold and sterile  plasticmetal chairs metal tables tiled floor  blues whites and silvers  very cold feeling  perfect on a hot summer day in tucson awful to try and relax in on any other day  their outdoor seating definitely helps a tremendous amount though  their espresso is straight up wrong  they use prepackaged coffee inserts and the espresso machine just gushes water out uncontrollably in all directions while the barista powers the handle to try and keep it all under control  its quite comical  that said when you dump water thats been flavored with coffee on to gelato magic happens  it can be pretty crappy coffee and it still tastes good somehow  my favorite is to order gelato here and run over to le buzz a bit away and get a doppio to dump on it for an affogato that takes more effort than it should  they will do blended espresso drinks gelattes and blended sorbet drinks with sparkling water sorbettinis also  the staff seems to have some regulars but still a lot of college kids floating through  overall they are pretty nice and helpful  always friendly and willing to help and get you a sample  this is my go to place for creamy cold sweet  you wont find better in tucson  large variety of rotating flavors","4414":"debated between a 3 and a 4 but the good pushed it up the food was phenomenal get the catfish get the pork ribs the twice cooked wings wereomg just amazing what brought this place down from a 5 is that the service was not the best our drinks were made incorrectly i love a strong drink and rarely turn one down but the drink i received was just nasty it was a friday night and the bar got busy quickly buti overheard the customers next to me complain about their drink as well we will definitely be back regardless because the food is really good","4415":"what can i say that has not already been said goooood stuuuuffff   enjoy","4417":"not half bad this place is a nice change from your normal snowballs considering you can get it stuffed with cheesecake its really refreshing and sets them apart from other snowball stands the reason i gave it 4 stars though is because it doesnt top my favorite snowball stand hansens if i would have never heard about hansens then the bar wouldnt be set so high for snola but thats the way it is plus hansens is closer to me but if im ever closer to snola definitely wouldnt mind going here","4418":"the fountain on locust is a saint louis gem i try to take all my out of town family and friends here they achieve a nice balance of standard american food blended with many unique food items that are specific to the style and ideas of fountain on locust for example they have pickle soup   not a lot of options if you are a vegetarian but i am and always make do my goto items are the tomato soup grilled cheese sutz salad and the veggie focaccia sandwich the basil faulty cocktail is also another special menu item imo   cost is reasonable usually not a wait and generally open street parking unless there is a concert or basketball game at chaifetz  i will always frequent fountain on locust as one of the favorite local spots","4421":"we came here hoping to find gelato that would recall what we had in florence a few months ago  the gelato is very nice yet the flavors we had were light and subtle not as strong as we enjoyed in italy  otohpanini were wonderful highly recommend the italiano and the pesto grilled cheese  chicken florentine was delicious but is spicy hot  the patio in the back is a great shady place to relax with family or friends on a warm summer afternoon  the staff are super friendly and extremely helpful  we will definitely return for lunch","4423":"its funny after reading some of the reviews i get the impression that some would never be happy this is a big bang for the buck for a family you can take a family here and it wont break the bank but if u r looking for a place to get drunk try some where else if you wat fancy i think this place is pretty nice and to compare this place with cracker barrel ur nuts i have eaten in a lot of places and for the money and the amount of food you get here blows everyone out of the water i sometimes dont see how they can afford to stay open with the prices i had a good experience first started out with there trio app with chicken finger mozz stick and their tostada nacho great my girl freinds salad came 30 sec before main meal my meal was their 12oz ribeye a little thin cooked perfect the mashed potato was just warm not hot the way i like it and the brocc was perfect i had the maui margarita this was pretty good first time for this drink overal pleased","4426":"crab rangoon is awesome our server rachel was super friendly and helpful well be back","4427":"one night my significant other and i came here by accident and drank a whole bunch of really really ridiculous cocktails all of which had suggestive names were still like remember that time we went to absolutli goosed and drank a bunch of really really ridiculous cocktails that was so much fun   the place looks like it used to be a bar and grill its been gussied up goosied up with some red walls and homegoods artwork i feel reasonably certain that on any given weekend you could run into at least three bachelorette parties here you dont go there for the decor or the clientele though you go there for the really really ridiculous cocktails with suggestive names","4430":"my daughter and i just visited this adorable bakery this morning and i was so impressed the decor was beautiful and the employees were very friendly and kind we bought croissants and macaroons and they were delicious the croissants were crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth the macaroons were a wonderful little dessert for after lunch we all enjoyed them it was a little expensive but in my opinion worth it for the high quality","4431":"great greek restaurant had great octopus and amazing sangrias with multiple flavors we got the blue raspberry and it was one of the best sangrias ive ever had great desserts as well if you have a sweet tooth","4434":"really great atmosphere it reminded me of a diner the service was great and the food came out fast the cheese curds are amazing the double cheeseburger meal is well priced and youll leave full looking forward to coming back and trying the frozen custard","4437":"ive always had good experiences at this location they are open 24 hours and you usually dont have to wait very long for food its cheap and filling tacos are dank 45 stars because their ranch isnt very good","4441":"our group visiting from atlanta hit hendricks tuesday evening while in st louis what a treat this is some classic handrubbed bbq with a spicy sauce sl style i stuck with the ipa from the list of microbrews and was more than satisfied  it had just the right amount of bitterhops with a bit of heft and color that i thoroughly enjoyed we started with the bbq nachos and went straight to dinner along with three the whole shebang platters basically one of everything from their smoky bbq menu we ordered additional sides to try them all  there were 6 at our table and plenty to take home with everyone full tothegills  being from the south i think i know bbq and at hendricks i wasnt disappointed  what better place to get st louis style bbq than in st louis while i thought everything good and smoky flavored i am accustomed to more rind seems to be more of a southern thing im also accustomed to a bit of creosote  that last not a particularly good thing but a result of overlong smoking i do love me some handrubbed goodness  get the ribs and youll be very satisfied  hendricks has real tables so youll feel comfortable bring family or business and judging from a tuesday night the place stays busy check out the tap handles while your there  zing","4444":"what a great place  i am not a fan of sushi etc but i have to say this is the first japanese restaurant ive gone to where there are enough non sushi items on the menu that i had a hard time choosing  my choices were great  awesome tempura vegetables to start and then a ginger glaze short ribs had to take some home they gave me so much for entree  i went with 2 friends who are into sushi etc and they both loved what they ordered  its a great place to go if there are suhshi fans and non fans in your group  everyone enjoyed","4445":"arrived at 730 on a tuesday morning and only one couple was already in the restaurant we actually thought it was still closed cuz they forgot to flip the sign over  so if you wanna avoid the long lines and long serving times come early prob not the easiest thing to do when your out all night in the big easy but now you knowshow up early and youll be fine  upon recommendation from our server i decided to go with the shrimp and and grits  which i thought was excellent it had a very distinct flavor and the lemon and garlic cream sauce really made it stand out imo of course  i would get this item every time i came here tho if i were to come here in the future    wifey had the pecan and banana pancakes which were very good almost didnt need the syrup but we put a little on there anyway   we were also interested in trying the fried green tomatoes which were battered slices of tomatoes 4 pcs which came with a spicy aoli sauce which were pretty good though i couldve done without them after the fact   service was excellent  we enjoyed our service very much and again since we came early maybe thats why our service was very good we didnt have to compete with the many customers who showed up a little later fighting for the attention of the servers  again come early and youre good  otherwise come in and try the food totally worth it","4447":"went here with my husband and another couple saturday night  not very busy when we walked in but picked up shortly after  apparently you are not supposed to park across the street but we got away with it  this place is cash only and even though theyve been featured on diners driveins and dives theres nothing inside to suggest that guy was ever here  we wouldnt have gone if not for that fact wouldnt know it existed so maybe they should at least put up a picture of him that was taken when he visited    they let you sample but have a sign that tells you please know when to stop i wish id read the reviews here first because i wouldve gotten a 6for6 sampler  they were all good flavors there are some funky ones for sure  i ended up with coffee pecan brittle and everyone else got red velvet except for my husband who got a scoop of cookie monster as well  he thinks that he will be trying to conquer the tchopitoulas sundae next time we visit  8 scoops of ice cream 8 toppings whipped cream cherry and i have no doubt he will get his name on the wall for finishing  the ice cream was very very rich and thick and super delicious  would definitely recommend if youre in the area but a little out of the way if you want to stay in the french quarter car required","4448":"i think its about time that i write a review for this place i always come here for my boba fix and vietnamese coffee its not the best boba that i ever had but it satisfies my boba cravings   i am giving this place a 45 because they have decent banh mi vietnamese sandwich boba drinks and vietnamese coffee  2 stars  good food the bread they use on their banh mi because its fresh and the outside is crunchy my favorite is the tofu banh mi because it is just perfect with the egg tofu and the awesome bread they have the grilled chicken is dry so you may want to choose other choices i also tried their beef pho and i definitely recommend it because the broth doesnt taste like there is too much msg added to it but it needs more meat in it 1 star  convenience i just call ahead for my banh mi or any order and they tell me that it will be ready in 515 minutes i definitely recommend that you call ahead so they can get your order ready  1 star good boba drinks they are not my best so far but their drinks definitely satisfy my cravings i love their vietnamese coffee because it is strong and it is more coffee than milk which for me means i am getting my moneys worth because i am getting more of the coffee i like my coffee strong so if you prefer more milk then you may have to tell them that you want more milk in your coffee 1 star  okay service overall they just have like a fast food service where they take your order and give you your order they were rude to use that one night my family and i were there but possibly its because they were almost closing so they were tired   location its next to honeybaked ham and across the movie theater plaza on us 19 in pinellas park they have a parking lot behind their restaurant as well as in front of the place that is along us 19  overall i will still come to this place and try other things on their menu","4449":"im surprised i havent written a review for this place yet but its now or never  my family and i were born in guatemala i was raised there during my youngster years but pretty much grew up in new orleans i go back to visit my family in guatemala quite frequently and theres nothing like a good ole tres leches or arroz con leche when i go home   i cant remember how long ago it was that my family and i discovered this place but i remember coming home and seeing a tres leches in the refrigerator and just the fact that i saw that cake in america was like finding a pot of gold with a leprechaun standing next to it i was so thrilled honestly at that very moment i didnt care where it came from i just wanted to eat it well then i finished it and i had to go buy another one before daddy saw that i ate the whole cake   my mom told me where the bakery was i think i drove up and down the street like 5 times before i saw it its so small but my goodness great things come in small packages my parents home is in kenner so its less than 10 minutes from their house very conveniently located in my case now that i live uptown i wish i could find a place like this in my area but until then stop by normas and get yourself a tres leches you wont regret it  tip just drive down the street rrrreeeaaallllllyyyyy slloooooowwwwwlllyyy so you dont miss it and drive around for 15 min like i did ","4452":"giant jenga is worth the trip im a sucker for odd bar games and i loved it  i went for my birthday and we had a great time  the food is pretty good and it is cheap staff was friendly to our group and you can take shots from a ski   i guess it just depends on the night you go as to the atmosphere  ive only been a couple times with a big group of friends so i would say if youd like a larger extension of your living room with drinks and games come on in","4453":"first time here in this burger king though im very picky about fast food joints and i got the croissanwich it was fresh delicious and then i went inside to use the rest room very clean overall id come again","4456":"mmm the best pho broth in reno you wont be disappointed such great service too the staff was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of the entire time great food great service","4460":"my husband and i came here for lunch before the aquarium while on vacation garlic knots were delicious and huge theyre the size of cinnamon rolls our margharita pizza was good but could have used more basil there was a mistake in the kitchen and our pizza didnt get put in right away our waitress stacey was really nice and covered the cost of the puzza we would definitely go back","4462":"not bad they have a great selection of beer i stopped by to get some magic hat and the prices werent too shabby either i tried this place out since it was somewhat close and i simply didnt want to walk all the way up to bella vista i found my beer quickly and was on my way out in less than five minutes the woman who checked me out was exceptionally friendly as well ill be back","4463":"super crowded  moves along pretty fast  took our deli lunch out back under the trees  very nice","4465":"purchased an almond cupcake the bottom line a small cupcake with big flavor i found that the cupcake was smaller than other cupcakes but it was really tasty was it worth 300 i guess would i pay 300 again probably not but my husband says he would customer service was ok the guy behind the counter was not friendly but he was not rude either the cashier was a bit friendlier i must admit based on all the great reviews on yelp i was expecting a bit more","4470":"i like it they are a machine over there and this is definitely the place to pick up coffee in the rittenhouse area   for two bucks you get a delicious iced or hot coffee and i cant complain about that  its always busy so i take mine to go i suggest you do the same rittenhouse square is only a block away enjoy it in the park","4472":"great visit veal chop amazing cannoli crunch cake yummy definitely plan another visit","4473":"i like to study in starbucks so my review reflects what i find conducive  disadvantageous    pros  bright            good location in terms of sitting outside  walking around           friendly staff           closes at 1011 pm as opposed to 93010 pm cherry hill location           good drink selection  clover brew  con  bathrooms almost always dirty and usually 1 out of 2 are out of order           floors around seats often have crumbsgarbage around them           parking is challenging  i understand this is a very busy starbucks and like the atmosphere but the fact that the bathrooms  floors are always less than stellar bother me","4475":"love this joint i find the fish to always be fresh its got a great vibe and fast service they are a new company but the owner wesley is far from new when it comes to sushi he ran origami alongside his family on the northern side of tampa proper i love seeing this modern take to sushi and i feel his is a true entrepreneur a personality i want to support to help keep tampa cool    amazing lunch specials and although they dont serve alcohol i can bring in my own with no corkage fee  i hope to see little kelp sushi joints pop up all over town","4476":"we love ajs the specialty food selections are outstanding we love to get a light dinner and eat on the patio tonight we enjoyed soup and salads the service experience at the deli counter is sort of hit and miss tonight they were understaffed  we will be back","4478":"ive only stayed in two hotels during my many trips to nola this place and the bourbon orleans i would now choose this place over the bourbon orleans i like the location better  its a block off of bourbon but also closer to the cool shops and restaurants on royal st   checkin was a breeze and the front desk staff was very friendly our room was ready for us at checkin even though we were there well before the advertised checkin time our room was very nicely decorated and was very spacious there was a desk that fit my husbands laptop a large comfortable bed a dresser for clothing a large tv a vanity table and a comfy chair and ottoman  even with all of this furniture there was still plenty of room to walk around in the room the bathroom was obviously recently renovated and was great the shower which took a bit of futzing around with to get working correctly had great pressure and temperature   our room looked out into the courtyard of the hotel with pretty trees and a nonworking at the time fountain one word of caution the pretty trees contain loud birds so if youre a light sleeper you may want to get a room away from this area   the hotel offers a complimentary breakfast every morning and i was pleasantly surprised by the offerings each morning at 700 am why was i up at 7 the staff would put out steaming dishes of scrambled eggs grits bacon sausage and then numerous toast options fresh fruit pastries fresh juices coffee and water the dining room the breakfast was in was very nice and had waitstaff available for assistance if needed  prices are great for this hotel  for the quality of room location and that great breakfast i wouldve happily paid more","4479":"had the 12lb guacamole bacon burger and it was delicious there wedge fries were also good the staff was really fast and polite overall a good experience","4482":"i am never disappointed with chipotle chipotle is the pinnacle of chain restaurant mexican fast food if i lived in ca or az i might not go here but in florida there isnt very good mexican food generally speaking those taco trucks are just average and cost just as much as chipotle which is convenently located to me  cheap and good","4483":"i have to say that i stumbled upon this place by mere accident last january and have been back three times most recently for the saints nfl kickoff small gem in the french quarter it has a great menu written beautifully on a chalkboard above the order counter my favorite is by far the fleur de lis omelette topped with a delicious crawfish sauce with a side of their awesome hash browns it is small but hospitable and the staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable and the food again is just yummers","4486":"ive been trying to get my wife to eat mexican for years now and she insists that she doesnt like it and its too spicy  well las cazuelas has has converted her  we sat outside on a breezy evening  we were promptly greeted and our wine byob was iced down  the server gave us the specials and was very attentive  they serve extra crispy chips w  salsa verde w just the right amount of spice   we got 4 appetizers and could not even finish  seriously the queso fundido may have been one of the best things ive tasted  a buttery ball of mexican cheese w mushrooms inplanted throughout  we ate it like a pasta twirling it around a fork  overly simple but so right  quesdillas w chicken served w pico de gallo were perfection beef tacos served w lime  salsa verde were delicious  tres marias were the low point of the meal  corn patties w black beans topped w chipotle chicken and ground beef were a bit bland and soggy but i ate the shit out of the toppings  we ended the meal w a tres leches that was extra moist and not too sweet one of my favorite desserts in any food genre  to top it off we had a 30 living social voucher 4 apps and dessert came to 11 before tip  there is no reason not to go here people  id say 45 stars","4488":"nice size beer hall upstairs good for big groups getting a beer on a busy saturday night did take awhile but the were slammed with some big bus parties arriving at the same time disappointed for the third time with the food always out of items","4489":"very friendly staff and really good food i love their milkshakes and their tots will go there again its a little far for me so i do not go there often but i do recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a good milkshake","4490":"it blows my mind that anyone has given lulus a subpar rating this is our goto spot for a slice of za the pizza is thin and crispy and the salads are mounding and flavorful we wish it was closer to our house because we would go a lot more often you can order whole pies or bytheslice making it a great choice for an anytime meal   food i have yet to try something on lulus menu that i dont like while my husband normally gets 2 slices i almost always gravitate toward the salads which are huge and super flavorful the cheese  basil is the best slice of pizza ive had but my husband claims the jalape\u00f1o popper pizza is out of this world its hard to go wrong no matter what slice you choose the scapegoat salad is my favorite and comes out in a very big portion the breadsticks are also really unique and a big serving they dont skimp we have never tried their sushi   drinks selfserve soda and they always have a lemoncucumber water i like that they serve lots of local beers and hard ciders as well   atmosphere its almost always lively during lunch time but its never hard to find a seat they have tvs for sports and cute decor up on the walls i like their big patio and that its dogfriendly   service man the folks behind the counter are always smiling and happy they serve up your food crazyfast too thats the benefit of bytheslice ordering   happy hour offerings daily lunch specials2 slices and a drink or 1 slice and a side salad   healthy hack i love lulus because when my husband wants pizza which is often i can get a totally filling healthy salad and they have so many to choose from lulus does it right   tips na","4491":"i was fiending a burger last week to pick up and devour in the car and this was the closet joint to my location  i ordered the house burger and sweet potato fries and it came out to about 18  the bun was airy and light the meaty part was cooked fine and the sweet potato fries were average  all in all it was a solid meal but left my super asian metabolism wanting more and overall worth of the meal felt more in the 12 range  i liked the inside vibe of the place too as it brought a tranquility to my random anxious states","4493":"yummy fine dining mexian food portions are good although plates could be 12 cheaper and i would be a regular the service is excellent friendly and they go above and beyond","4495":"nice atmosphere and love that they serve food gourmet food in fact the beers were good but not my favorite was a bit disappointed that the sampler sizes were so  compared to just getting a full glass","4496":"great lunch spot prices are great on both main dishes and sushi friendly servers and excellent food every time i have been","4498":"i went to ted drewes last night and was reminded that i never reviewed it ted drewes is a st louis staple and a must have after the cardinals game some of my faves are the strawberry shortcake lemon crumb or smores concrete all equally delicious i usually have one of my dogs in tow so it is much appreciated that they sell doggy bowls with small amounts of custard for only 150 my only small gripe about ted drewes is the parking situation ted drewes is right near a very busy road and the parking lot is always super packed so parents should make sure to keep kids close by there are a couple of benches there but most people with vans or jeeps pop their trunk and eat in the back of their car over all i give ted drewes an a","4504":"went here for dinner last night for dining under the stars we got there pretty early around 5456 and were seated right away  we ordered the bruschetta for an app it was very good i wish there had been more of it but at 6 i cant complain i just love tomato and would have gladly eaten the whole plate by myselfmaybe next time   for our entrees i had the ravioli quarto formaggio and my fianc\u00e9 had the fusilli lunghi i loved my dinner it comes in a delicious cream sauce the portion was a nice size i think it was 7 or 8 raviolis and i took 3 home the sauce is very rich so its not something you would want to eat a huge portion of all at once my fianc\u00e9 said his meal was good too   our waitress was very nice a little slow but thats to be expected on such a busy night we also heard her pacify a rather drunk and obnoxious patron sitting near us in a very tactful way   my only complaint was that she said she had to take our app and entr\u00e9e order all at once due to how busy they were it would have been nice to  have something on the table while we were picking our entrees since we were both very hungry but she did space them out so at least everything didnt come all at once","4505":"do you like good beer if so the foodery is the best place in cc to buy beer to go whether you mixasix buy a six pack of one beer or buy a few singles the foodery has the best selection  you can find beers from all over the usa europe asia and probably some places you didnt know exist they dont have price tags on the beers or in the coolers but they have a handy notebook that lists all their beers and prices so you wont be too shocked if your mixasix adds up to 20 also the guys who work at the foodery are all knowledgeable about beer so if you have questions dont be afraid to ask finally if youre just looking for a 6pack of lager or bud they have that too","4506":"excellent food clean tables and floors conscientious and attentive staff sodadrink bar has free refills plenty of napkins utensils and condiments the line to place your order is usually a bit long but it is well worth the wait if youre eating inside or out in the patio tables or doing a takeout order you will not be disappointed would i go back again absolutely yes this chipolte is a keeper great for either an evening meal or business workday lunch ","4511":"i only come here for their ice cream its always been delicious but nothing that amazing for the prices but would be a nice place for a date or to escape the hot stl summer","4512":"this place is a part of the heart of st petersburg if you only come to visit you mist

department all kinds of great coffee beans or just get an espresso at the coffee bar if youre making dinner stop in the wine and cheese room for hors doeuvres and excellent wine choices why only 4star rating because the newer employees arent as observant as the employees that haven been there since i discovered the place in the year 2000 i tend to stand there holding the next number while they mill around and finally realize someone else needs to be served even when not during the rush this place gets super busy around lunch time they have a daily  weekly sandwich if you come on friday definitely get the sammys big fish sandwich its only available on friday","4516":"fantastic find soup nazi best describes this man he is definitely passionate about his food art and will not sway from his way every ingredient in the meal is fresh also do note that this a get what you get place there is only one item on be menu each dayand the item changes everyday the only consistency with this place is that it serves grilled chicken and falafel everytime expect a long wait got there at 1230p and didnt get food until 120p but while waiting in line  got to chatting with some regulars and the food is said to be fantastic everyday   happy eatings cash only spot and bring your own fork oddly they dont provide utensils nor napkins just a styrofoam box and the food inside of it","4517":"i dont want to take anything away from the food but the service was the star   for midlevel restrauant the service was well above standard  madeline was our primary server she visited frequently corrected problems before we could even bring them up missing side was familiar with the menu polite friendly anticipated our needs etc  i enjoyed the hopstorm ipa with my spicy chicken in peanut sauce with soba noodles","4518":"i really enjoyed the sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli  definitely the highlight of my visit  hip city veg offers this sophisticated dish which you might expect to see only at much fancier restaurants in a casual fastfood setting  based on prior yelp reviews i tried the udon noodle salad which was pretty good but was a little unbalanced and could be improved  although it had a promising start with a pleasant mix of chickn arugula and alfalfa sprouts the bottom half of the salad had too much seasoning  an easy fix might be to ease up on the dressing or leave it as a side component    the dining atmosphere is pleasant  sort of like an ecofriendly fast food joint that seeks to bring vegan dishes to the masses i like the concept but if youre a diehard carnivore im not sure this place will convince you otherwise  that said the location is great if you are on the penn campus looking for a lunch option or staying at the homewood suites on 41st and walnut and want to try something new this location does a brisk takeout business but its also a casual place to dine alone or with a friend  however the space is not ideal for large groups except for the giant table in the middle of the room  i look forward to seeing hip city veg in the washington dc area  it should do well there","4522":"i like this place however a friend once told me the wings were better than the ales skip on thosenot even close other things on the menu are good thoughgood beers on tap and great liquor selections","4523":"super tasty ice cream and mammoth shakes we had the new yorker with strawberry cheesecake and it was definitely enough for two people service was nice and the ladies at the counter were helpful it took us about 5 minutes to get our shake with one other person in line parking is plentiful only complaints i have are that we had a hard time finding a place to sit because tables were not clean and the noise level was pretty high otherwise a pretty cool stop","4524":"damn good establishment tucked away in east falls overlooking the schuylkill service was good  the waitor was exceptionally knowledgable of menu good wine list and solid craft beer options on tap  started w the meat and cheese plate of the waitors choice high quality products reasonably priced delicious ordered scallops w bacon and although the portion size was small for the price should have been 3 scallops instead of 2 the dish was well done and worth a taste finished w a four cheese pizza which was the best made brick oven pizza ive ever had crispy yet soft dough minimal grease just right  absolutely reccomended","4525":"this is my favorite burger spot in new orleans out side of port of call im from a city that has varieties of foods and moving to new orleans i had been very uncomfortable with the selection until i stumbled across this little spot we originally walked in when a cinnabon being prepared for a customer caught our eye fyi the donuts and the cinnabon is amazing well long story short we ended up staying for a min and ordering the burger between wedges and chees burgers and chicken something lol wasnt my favorite but overall it was all great im a happy every other week customer now","4527":"this was my first time coming here the line was pretty busy for a saturday lunch time but they had 3 people taking orders so it moved through pretty fast very clean inside and restrooms clean as well wr ordered the choose two garden salad and the veggie sandwich and the french dip roast beef sandwich and country potato soup the meal was delivered to the table in a timely manner and staff was very friendly food was delicious","4529":"service was ok all i got was blank stares as i looked at the menu no hi can i help you no recommendations but as soon as i got my sandwhich i became a fan i got the 8 old pueblo sandwhich with fries and a drink came out to around 10 and some change i would like to spend a little less for a meal personally overall i will be going back because the food was tastey and hot just like i like it","4532":"totally worth the drive for a latenight fix  and on most nights youll witness the most interesting local flavor anywhere in jefferson parish  go","4534":"i have been to the duke a few times now mostly for sunday brunch which is irresistible at 11 for steak eggs chunky hash browns and a beer or coffee with baileys  ive also met up with friends for happy hour appys et cetera and i have to say i have been really impressed with the food and with the wait staff  both are above average much better than what you would expect for this neck of the woods argyll industrial area   the duke offers your usual pub food but it does it right  for example many many pubs offer miniyorkshire puddings but often they are dried out and overcooked  the ones they make here see my picture are just like your english granny would make light fluffy and delicious and served with a drizzle of horseradish sauce perfect  other great appy offerings ive tried are the quesadilla the halibut bites and lemon pepper shrimp  most appys will run you about 10 for a large portion and if you come at happy hour on a friday the appys are half off  5 for a mealsized appy  you dont often get deals for good pub food like this in edmonton certainly not in the downtown    if youre looking for a sports pub style place the duke offers numerous tvs and a projection screen so its a good place to watch the game it also offers a dart board pool tables and vlts    things i dont care for at the duke  it gets pretty loud in there and even louder when the talent for the night shows up  the last live entertainer wailed out such classics as do you come from the land down under needless to say we left in short order  the selection of beer they have on tap is also somewhat limited slightly better than the average bluecollar pub ie  they have stella but i wish they offered some of our fine local edmonton beer on tap  i think a pint of charlie flint or aprikat would go great with my sunday steak and eggs","4535":"i am a fan for sure of this market there was plenty of variety packed into this little place everything was very fresh and looked awesome the prices are insanely awesome i was able to get a ton of vegetables and fruit for about 7 i will go back for sure","4539":"375  good overall conventional grocery store  this one has a organic section as well as a good pet food section","4543":"ordered 2 great first time good attitude for fast food joint and good wait time","4547":"as a visitor to nola i was told i have to try these stuffed sno cones or sno ball shaved ices i went with the chantilly on recommendation from my local friend it was stuffed with their famous cheescake filling which was unusual but also delicious i liked the thinnly milled ice and the sweet surups and also the added fruit definitely something i can see locals swarming to when the weather gets hot and sticky in the summer however your hands and clothes have the risk of getting sticky as well p","4551":"blue claws can be pricey but phenomenal stick with the larges io jumbo sizes very close and save some  great with fries and beer ive never had anything but those 3 things so couldnt tell you much else but worth the visit if youre looking for crabs in philly","4554":"some inconsistency lately on the way the lattes have been being delivered not sure what happened but hopefully it will be corrected i think ill just return the coffee next time still love this place","4555":"fluffy clouds of love                     topped with powdered sugar bliss                          makes me wish for more  yum really who can resist fried dough topped with powdered sugar served with a side of cafe au lait","4560":"375  good selection of high end gourmet food  beverages  definitely a must stop for fellow foodies  however if youre just looking for staples than a conventional grocery store will be more economicallol","4561":"a friend and i dined during the devour indy event we ordered the queso empanadas and polenta for our first course both were fantastic my friend ordered the pork pastor and it was delicious on the other hand i ordered the chicken enchilada verde and it was not good at all it was bland and left a funny taste in my mouth i didnt take more than a few bites the real star of the night was the flanchurro dessert combo amazing im already craving it the service was very friendly and attentive the valet was also very convenient 8 for parking until 1045 will be back again to try more","4566":"donde esta la panderia these are the first words i ever learned in spanish when i was about eighteen years old i was standing on a street corner in tijuana a man approached me and asked if i needed help because i looked lost he was not a creep or anything he was genuinely concerned for my safety i told him i was trying to find a bakery i love mexican pastry  he pointed me in the direction of the bakery i was looking for and taught me my first spanish words  my love for flan and other sweet mexican pastels pastries is still a motivating force in my travels so when i discovered a mexican bakery only a  few blocks from my house i was ecstatic but they also sell tamales and have taken flan to a whole new level with the flan chocolate cake my son used to always ask me to bake flan for him now he asks me to take him to this bakery because he likes their flan so much if you have never been to mexico and would like to sample a tiny bit of their culture give this place a try","4570":"fun familyfriendly atmosphere creative treats i would not recommend the plain glazed donuts however highly recommend the cinnamon roll and their coffee also great customer service the employees seem to really love what they do and where they work","4571":"i love richies breakfast is always delish  ready when i get there i usually call in advance when i order in person i never wait long the lunch food is pretty good too the best of richies is richie himself he is so friendly and treats each customer as if they were long time friends great place great service","4574":"love this place great food and the staff is always super friendly the steak tacos are where its at","4576":"kelp sushi delivered some tasty sushi rolls i ate the spicy tuna and california rolls both were tasty with large pieces of fresh fish within each roll ordered takeout over the phone and used a coupon code for 10 off the order was packed neatly with the rolls tightly wrapped in waxed paper rather than plastic containers the decor inside was hip and trendy i would go back with a group and try out more dishes","4579":"this place came highly recommended by friends after a morning of driving i was ready to devour some amazing food the boozy milkshake stole the show my husband had a milkshake without alcohol which was also stupid good the fries and the homemade sauces were also delicious i wish the fries were a bit warmer but hey fries are fries we both got burgers when looking at the menu we thought the amount of ingredients would  a ton of flavor but that wasnt the case both burgers cooked medium were just okay not a ton of flavor nothing special they were both beef so if we went back id try one of the other meats all in all the milkshakes alone are a reason to check this place out","4580":"this is a casual pizza joint  i needed a little something heartier than a slice of pizza so i ordered the veggie roll  im not sure what makes it a roll rather than a calzone other than its shape but it was delicious  their marinara is delicious so i bet their pizza is awesome  the veggies in the veggie roll were all fresh not frozen or canned and i always appreciate that  the staff was friendly enough and my food was cooked really fast  there werent a lot of people in there though so i dont know how the wait is when its packed  ill definitely be back to try the pie","4581":"the four stars i am giving maynards are for the cocktail i had a delectable libation combining crushed blackberries and whiskey   potent sexy and pretty to look at it melded beautifully with the chic surroundings of maynards on a friday night add to this a wild monsoon and you have a cinematic start to a night out  the passing plates looked divine but i cant attest to their delish factor because all we did was drink next time maynard next time","4582":"we went for thanksgiving dinner this year family style we were sat outside and when booking online through opentable there is no way to state the preference in seating or knowing where we sat they called a week before and required a credit card on file for reservations which i didnt even know they would do lucky i answered the phone that night  we were seated outside they had plenty of heaters but it was cold for tucson and there were leaves on the table and very spread out i did see empty tables inside however even though we had reservations they would not seat us inside the server kenneth was outstanding which really saved my rating on the stars my family and i were not impressed with the family style main course it was all on one plate mashed potatoes gravy cranberries turkey lamb and stuffing which didnt make any sense and was really weird we did get extra of the mashed potatoes and stuffing after asking kenneth and him seeing my moms face when we were served via 1 plate for 3 people the portions were definitely small but the food was good quality great the leaves definitely fell into our drinks and food which was not a great experience and the train going by every 15 minutes or so was not the perfect quiet family meal i had been hopingthe total bill was 200 for 3 people which may or may not have been worth it not sure if we will be going back next year but the experience of the service was outstanding","4583":"i think this place is a lil better than panera bread they have a lot of good sandwich soup and salad options the strawberry with poppy seed dressing and chicken i had was refreshingly delicious the steak panini was delish their chocolate chip cookie was good and they have a fresh brewed sweet tea yum","4585":"great huge new space  they were only open 12 weeks before my arrival  i like the pint jar glass ware  the bathroom needs sprucing up but im sure they will get there they are brand new and there beer is already sold in something like 80 establishments","4587":"loved this place came for a brunch of sorts  three donuts coffee and a half chicken for two the donuts we had were all hot  strawberry lavender vanilla spice and the honey glazed that came with the chicken all were fantastic  soooooo good they are about as big as an entemans donut and they are indeed light tasting although im sure not light in calories the chicken was also very good  got the dry rub zaatar which was excellent zaatar is dried thyme oregano marjoram or some combination thereof mixed with toasted sesame seeds salt and sumac great stuff a couple of the pieces were drier than id like and would have been great if there was a dipping sauce none the less  really liked it although for those who have had bon chon this is similar  although i liked the crust on this chicken a lot hopefully next time we will get a fancy donut however they were all sold out when we got there at 330 oh great service and solid music too","4590":"this frozen yogurt place is a nice addition on south street","4592":"ok super cheap i am willing to bet the cheapest in town but when you get prices like this you also get the full on families in their with their 6 kids to go shopping with mom by her self  honestly its bad enough to have to go shopping by your self but to add all 6 kids ugghhh talk about ruining everyones shopping experience stay away from this store around the 1st week of any month or you will see what i am talking about   they have bulk items and did i mention its cheap","4596":"they rep the californiastyle donut hard here if youre into that sort of thing and who isnt id recommend these dudes or dks much improved meridian outpost over nampas similar daylight donuts  the maple bacon bar hogs all the hype and its totally justified but dks greatest achievement in donut engineering is actually their oldfashioned crueller all their cake donuts delight me but that crueller represents everything that makes california donuts great not only is it submerged in hot grease long enough for a perfectly crisped exterior to form its also smothered with enough saucy butterloaded glaze that the top few layers of the pastry get thoroughly soaked its special like a donut should be","4598":"i love the chicken salads at this place they come in a tortilla shell and have a lot of beens rice lettuce with really good grilled chicken i used to go to the pollo feliz on tucson and valencia that is now a chickenuevo and the food is still just as good it is nice to have one in the neighborhood this location is in an old long john silvers right next to miss saigon which is the old perkins there has been a lot of repurposing in this area and ultimately both of these are moves in the right direction you get a lot of food for you money at this place and i have yet to have something i didnt enjoy","4604":"i love the atmosphere and set up it is very modern and calming i also thought the omelet was good value large quantity and good quality","4605":"i shop at the fresh market frequently and have always been pleased with my purchases i have shopped there for many years the prices for meat and produce are in line with local grocery stores and local meat markets organic milk breads and bakery items are also similarly priced they often have specials that are well worth the visit i prefer the hometown feel of this market to that of larger markets they always have the fresh produce meats and bakery items i am looking for","4607":"everyone loves bulk barn and so do i   so many aisles of awesome stuff i definitely wasnt expecting what i saw when i went in i was expecting just standard bulk bins and then just big club pack bags not all bins once i walked through the candy aisles i got so frustrated because there were so many options i seriously ended up getting none haha my chief complaint about this place waswell  i was a baddie and sampled some of the candy and i didnt find them to be too tasty i mean this in the sense of youre used to buying maynards fuzzy peaches but now youre buying dollar store furry tangerines  also with some of the bagged candy i ended up buying anyways some of it tasted a bit older like it has been sitting on the shelf for a bit either way i was really impressed with the selection they had here peanut butter seriously","4612":"i would love to give 5 stars but its hard because i have never had this type of food before its hard for me to compare but what i can say is this place is amazing its an excellent place to stop for lunch when walking in manayunk the customer service is definitely a 5 while i was waiting on my food and smoothie i was offered samples of other smoothies the falafel is amazing as well as all the chicken pitas just started going here about a month ago and ive been there 3 times already must try for foodies","4613":"the old location was my favorite study spot the new location is beautiful with the same great food and great customer service the but it feels strange sitting there for a few hours to do work since the new space has more of a restaurant feel and less of that nice coffee house vibe but hey its probably better for business i may now go there for brunch but not for studying","4614":"the first best thing about kermits is how late theyre open so many bakeries close at 6pm and thats just impossible for someone who works kermits is open til 10 thats stellar i will say that it felt a little like kermits needs to decide if theyre a bakery or a pizza shop they didnt have a ton of baked goods on display or display space but their kitchen looked massive the people who work there are really friendly and cool the pastries i got brownie and mini cheesecake were delicious and visually appealing will definitely go again although i hope they have a few more things available","4615":"this is a nice place for taiwanese food ate there tonight there is some generic chinese food on the menu as well as some nice specialty items what really makes it unique in my opinion is the smoothie menu my wife got the taro smoothieso delicious i had never had one and it was excellent the fried calamari was also tender and very tasty did i taste a little cinammon cashew chicken was probably tastiest ive ever had very nice subtle seasoning shrimp chow mein was great as well not too greasy and shrimp were giant and cooked perfectly my wife also had beef tripe which was a little too spicy   this is a somewhat new area for restaurants in reno it works i really enjoyed the meal and the service was very friendly ill be recommending to my asian cuisine fans in the future for sure  also the restaurant is clean fresh and modern cool little spot","4617":"i stumbled across phillips produce while traveling down the road and decided to make a stop as i was running early and it looked very old school i was surprised to see some major brands like dole  but i realize sometimes that must be necessary if they want to keep a good inventory the prices seemed competitive with my home area and the convenience of just hopping out of your car to purchase your produce with out taking a hike through a big box store was very nice   if i was from the area phillips produce would be a regular stop for me","4620":"very good  house salad was great  pasta was very good  ravioli appetizer was pretty standard  schlafly beer on tap and they will let you sample  waite staff was great  another person had posted that the beer is fifteen dollars the fresh and yummy draft beer i had was nine","4622":"sometimes you just get a craving for kfc if you dont know what kfc is youve been missing out on the good things in life korean fried chicken aka kfc is cocos deep fried chicken specialty its their bread and butter so dont come here expecting to see other korean dishes on the menu although technically they have homemade chicken and waffles so that could be considered something different  it was my first time here so i thought it would be the perfect time to bring along a good buddy of mine who has never had korean food before ever what ive read some reviews on cocos and i have no idea what some people were complaining about  sure its not the biggest restaurant out there but there is more than enough room to sit down and eat if you want to do that over take out there must be about 89 tables total bonus that there were a lot of koreans coming in to eat  we decided to share a few things  set 1 2999  you get 10 pieces of kfc half and half plus your choice of any two drinks we went with cass fresh a korean light beer and sapporo i dont usually order drinks with food but beer and kfc seem to be a match made in heaven  as for the fried chicken it was spot on  crunchy juicy and best of all greaseless its tough to say which was better the crispy deep fried chicken versus the sweet and hot sauce chicken both were awesome however if i had a gun to my head sweet and hot sauce chicken would win although its in no way hot  but who cares when it is seriously that tasty   sweet potato fries 599 for a large  nice side dish to have with the chicken the sweet potato fries were light crispy but could have used some sort of sauce to go with them  anyways great spot to get yur kfcness in  check them out especially if youre doing some shopping at nearby south edmonton commons seriously how is a puma outlet there and no one told me","4625":"tried both the turtle and all shook up the former is packed with nuts and the latter is wonderfully packed with ripe banana get some but due to the extreme richness order a size smaller if you want your pants to still fit","4632":"in 2014 you wouldnt catch me dead in this place however the past 2 years pops has made some major improvements i personally now go there all the time to pick up my take out beer i have also gotten wings at this place and they are tremendous great local spot for a quick bite to eat or take out beer to go great work pops your whole team should be proud of the turnaround in such a short time","4633":"this earls has done a really good job changing the atmosphere from what it used to be to what it is today  i went to earls for a chamber if commerce mixer where the food is free and the drinks are a la carte they served pulled pork coleslaw spoons which were amazing i had a sous chef that kept coming my way with the served trays because he could see it in my eyes how much i liked them  the other item was some sort of sushi roll which always blows my mind that a place thats not a sushi restaurant can execute a sushi roll so well when a lot of real sushi restaurants are not good at all thank you earls for having legit red seal chefs the only reason this isnt 5 stars is that they crammed 60 people into an area designed for no more than 30 at least i got to know people a little better which was the whole point of the mixer","4634":"we ate here on our last night in new orleans the dining room was very clean and our waitress was greatreally friendly and attentive we ordered the crab and artichoke dip as an appetizer and i had the fried shrimp platter the portions were very generous and the food was good good goodmuch better than we expected from a small dinertype establishment its also open quite a bit later than most of the other dinein restaurants in the area very glad that we checked it out","4636":"great selection ordered the happy herd which was more than enough for 5 people food was a bit cold but overall great taste will definitely be coming back","4641":"stoneyhead brewing is one of the most inconspicuous and even overlooked breweries in our region  which is a real shame since there are fantastic and enjoyable brews on tap here that any beerhunter in reno should definitely check out  if you have never visited stoneyhead before make sure to ask about a tasting flight  on your first visit for no charge you will get small splashes of just about everything they have on tap  i really appreciate this sort of customer service as it is a fine way to let newcomers get an idea of what suites their own tastes especially since they dont focus just on one type or style of beer here but instead brew a little bit of everything from pales to porters  i tried a few things tonight since it had been a good while since last i passed through their doors  if you are looking for something not so heavy i would recommend both the dlight and especially the honey pale  the latter of which i found utterly delicious and perhaps one of the better light pales ive had from around our region  the irish red is also quite delightful and to which i can eagerly give thumbs up to  on the stronger side of things the sneak attack is very enjoyable british ipa which has a nice lightness and sweetness to it much different from the ultrabitter ipas i am accustomed to  just watch out as this aptlynamed beverage will hit you hard if youre not careful  some drinks to consider are the mixed beers which are like cocktails made from two of their brews combined together  the sneaky redhead sneak attack and the irish red is fun to try but for my money i would go for the honey porter honey pale and their porter which really made a balanced rich and sweet tasting combo  there are a couple barrelaged beers i was regrettably not able to get to this evening  however there are two very intriguing spiced ipas which i highly encourage any customers to try out  the beers are like a paired set one themed for spring and summer the other for fall and winter  the summer is a combo witbelgianipa which tastes surprisingly light and sweet flavored with things like orange peel  the autumn in contrast is a brownipa which is more robust and flavored with spices we normally associate with the colder months  and if after enjoying a pint or two you want some beer togo then you can fill up some growlers or buy much of their beers in bottles which are also available in stores around town  located in a converted warehouse in an industrial park off south longley know that if you plan on visiting parking can be a little tight as a lot of the spaces are reserved for some of the other businesses in the complex  however i think if you are visiting after regular business hours you shouldnt have a problem  once you walk in you can snag a place at the bar or at one of any number of tables benches or armchairs strewn about the room  service is exceptionally friendly and attentive with a cool upbeat attitude  if you need something to munch on while you drink the proprietors generously keep bowls of popcorn and peanuts constantly full on the bar as well as offering a few snacks for sale and having menus for the restaurant just a few buildings away should you want to walk over for dinner  there are some bar games present and even a bbq if you want to bring your own stuff to grill up outside  i am sorry it has taken me a while to circle back to stoneyhead  it most certainly wont be another couple of years until next i stop by for a drink  cheers guys","4642":"so good authentic and reasonably priced  i have tried everything from tacos gorditas tortas sopes and most recently the posole it was so good and spicy my mouth is watering right this moment  yummy","4645":"frost is a cute place for a scrumptious treat i am not a dairy eater and have not tried their ice creams but ther sorbet is out of this world my hubby always enjoys their caramel ice cream and i love to adventure around their fruit sorbets from strawberries and champagne peach and even blackberry cabernet they have an amazing array of flavors and i have never been anything less than amazed","4646":"first timers at this little gem the food and desserts were amazing  byob  the staff were friendly and helpful but we needed a little more attention  one little nit the place needs new rugs   disgusting  the tablecloths need to be burned and buried","4649":"all in all i would say this place is pretty nice the only reason i cant give 5 stars it seems like  service was decent not great and the hostess was very unfriendly kind of had   rbf tried the beer it was good and the food was pretty decent also i will probly go back","4650":"im amazed it took me so long to come to this restaurant as i am a big fan of upland beers we visited on a saturday night so it was pretty crowded but we were able to get two seats at the bar right away the service was super quick and friendly i was very pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that upland offered i had a difficult time choosing between their options which rarely happens at nonvegetarian places they had a good mix of their classic beers along with their more experimental beers","4651":"well its time i finally put my 2 cents in on this place ive been wanting to yelp about this place for awhile but when i sit down to do it im torn in so many directions that i decided to break it down for ya below  service 4 starts  always nice but a plea to the checkout employees herelets not all discuss our personal hygienelife stories to every customer pllleeaaasseee im so glad you have nothing else better to do but i work for a living and am in a hurry move it ugh  meat dept 5 stars im a recovering vegetarian exseattlitenuf said so i love the meat here very fresh and expensive i used to shop at butcher boys for my meat now i go here since bbs closed i cant find my vealbuffalo etc for my cooking so i suck it up and shop here  seafood 4 stars  nice fish i love their oysters i can get a dozen here for under 10 and they shuck and put the little suckers on ice for you with a cover woo hoo i would pay triple that price if i went anywhere else including the scary oyster bar restaurants around town on a personal note to the cute blond dude that works in this dept that was formerly from bb will you marry me his customer service takes the sting out my wallet here a little note to selfask him out on a date  everything elsewtf im sorry but i refuse  to pay 599 for a box of fing strawberries i dont care if the pope and dali lama both dug the holes in the dirt and blessed the stupid fruit themselves its just food for fs sake  we all joke this place is called whole paychecks and its true for a reason i shop at wincotrader joes for most of my food same damn thing less  i do buy my meat at this place so i am a customer i do get a kick of going there and doing a bit of yuppie watching from time to time im a former seattlite so i can say that without pretension but come on this is reno people not  bellevue work with me hereplllleeeeases   now get out my way i want to pay for my veal","4654":"delicious cakes and pastry a little pricy but they are delicious and worth it the best ricotta canolli around although i would stay far from this place on a holiday i have stood there with a number ticket and watched friends of the workers get waited on before me when i was already waiting a long time","4656":"great food i had the baked salmon benedict wife had the monte cristo we will be back","4660":"i ate at bareburger for lunch today started with the pickles and salads all of the pickles were yummy i liked the one salad coleslaw like salad but didnt love the wasabi carrot salad my fianc\u00e9 ordered the hog wild wild boar pimento cheese fried egg chickpea onions green tomato brioche bun which was sooo good i ordered the cali fresh salad and added the black bean as my meat i didnt realize that when you add meat to your salad it comes in a burger form so i had a black bean burger on top of my salad the salad was ok it had a lot of bean sprouts and lacked on the amount of kale i wouldnt go here for a salad i would go back for their burgers next time ill have to try a shake","4661":"had the arepas empanadas and the chicken bowl all of the dishes were above average with the arepas tasting the best the ingredients were fresh customer service was polite and all of the dishes were a good value i will definitely return","4663":"ive been visiting db for many years and theyre consistently good at all the standard fare you seek when stopping at a custard stand  cheese fries here are the best  ice cream and custard treats are all very good  the burgers cheese steaks etc are fine  not the best ive ever had but good  overall a worthwhile spot to stop if youre in the area and need to satisfy some cravings not spend too much money and are in the mood for a casual atmosphere  a few picnic tables outside on a concrete pad plenty of parking many folks end up sitting in carstrucks while eating no inside seating  come as you are and youll see people in formal attire its a favorite local join so sometimes a visit is due after a wedding church graduation party etc sports gear after games beach and pool outfits and even pjs","4666":"i was immediately greeted as i walked in by a cheerful employee who directed me and took my order in an extremely friendly manner my food was prepared quickly and presented in an equally friendly way good food i was in and out in less than 30 minutes really worked out well while juggling appointments","4667":"besides it being crowdedthe food is amazing decorated and arranged like a really old school super market this place has all the italian imports i love the sweets their bakery is legit with fresh bread and pastries i recommend the canolis however you cant go wrong with any dessert i like the smores tart as well  the sandwiches are very delicious and very affordable i recommend the hot italian sandwich i see why this place is very popular im a fan however i recommend not going during peak hours ie noon  1p because it is too crowded and the parking isnt that great either and if you want to eat in the patio area you kinda have to fight for a table also they dont provide any bags in the patio cashier area also the imports are a bit pricey  mean a piece of chocolate is  like 3 nonetheless definitely worth going to","4669":"my family and i have been here many times the food is good the beer selection is better than good the service can be a bit less than youd hope for at times  its a pub people if you want a tasty burger and some really good wings and a nice beer and enjoy the atmosphere of a crowd watching sports then this is the place for you if you want impeccable service and gastropub selections then go somewhere else my favorite is the chili burger i ask for extra chili on the side and they bring a ton of it","4670":"you must check out the gyros they are great there is a lot of meat and if you are a meat head like me you will really appreciate that check this spot out for great chicago style food","4675":"our first time at zimmers and the line was wrapped around the store nice people and the line moved pretty efficiently it is a seafood place on friday in lent somakes sense we bought 2 lbs of crawfish 1 lb of boiled shrimp they ran out of crab some sausage and tried the marinated crab all were very good fresh and tasty but on the mild side i liked the marinated crab but not much meat in it as you dig through the crab pieces marinade was good though mild but flavorful and not salty which i liked we will definitely be back","4678":"usually when i come to this chipotle im quite pleased as some of the workers are extremely nice and helpful maybe once or twice i had a slight issue with this location usually with the portions and charging me extra on certain items when i shouldnt have been charged regardless this is one of the few chipotles i actually enjoy","4679":"great service friendly staff little pricey but big portions enchiladas were awesome salsa a lil bland but they added some habanero to of and was great","4680":"i absolutely love the food here their speciality fries are all amazing but you should expect to be waiting at least 3540 minutes if their busy having only two cooks one grill and tons of orders is a recipe for irritable customers and not a great place to stop on your lunch break in the city due to that","4682":"my coworkers and i placed an order for capriottis ive been to different capriottis locations before and have always had stellar sandwiches my experience here did not disappoint my stomach   in total we ordered 13 sandwichessalads and 2 bags of chips they forgot a sandwich and both bags of chips in our order this was frustrating but we figured it out their sandwiches are massive so luckily we had enough to share  the bobbie is a fanfavorite and my personal goto it features homemade turkey cranberry sauce stuffing and mayo it is basically thanksgiving in a sandwich the bbq chicken salad is another one of my favorite things to order it comes with a chipotle ranch dressing that literally makes you want to lick your bowl  food 5 stars missing food 1 star","4683":"i had not heard that nashville had a hot chicken truck until just a few days ago  my boyfriend is a huge hot chicken fan  so naturally this weekend when we saw that the hot spot was going to be at the wanderland nash food truck frenzy at elmington park we headed on over  for nashville food trucks the prices are average with most meals around the 7 range  where as most of the other food trucks had their bottled water and drinks for 1 the hot spot had theirs at 150  all their drinks were 150 whether it was a 169 ounce bottled water or a 12 ounce can of pop  probably best to check other food trucks for drinks  on to the food i have a very weak palate for spicy  so my boyfriend ordered the 2 piece twisted chicken with one with sriracha on it and one without  and we also ordered some hand cut fries  it took a little bit for the ladies in the truck who were taking the orderspayments to get everything completed with our transaction but by the time we got that taken care of our food was done  the seasoning on the chicken is totally bomb  it is spicy by itself without their sriracha  the inside of my lip tingled  it was perfectly spicy for me  and my boyfriend liked it as well  he actually said he liked it better without the sriracha on it  the chicken was fried perfectly  the skin was crispy without being over breaded and was incredibly juicy tender and temperature hotas well as spicy hot  i kinda wished that my boyfriend and i had not split the 2 piece order  the hand cut fries were pretty tasty delishus as well  we didnt get a dessert or try any of their breakfast items but they do serve the breakfast all day which i love places that serve breakfast all day  im a definite fan  and if i come across a line of food trucks and the hot spot is there i will probably head straight to the hot spotat least for the food","4685":"id imagine that if most people were asked in what part of town they enjoy the cuisine the most it would be downtown but for me my favorite area for food is on orchard between emerald and franklin time to score another one for the area like orient market deli baguette is just barely off of orchard on franklin but close enough to merit inclusion for what i consider my favorite area for food  the food in itself is not eyebrowraising spectacular but the basis for the recommendation comes in creating baguette sandwiches that are both solid and unique to the area these are not your normal submarine sandwiches offering options like daikon pate and cilantro on freshlymade baguettes via the orient market that create a somewhat different and frenchinspired taste to the palate i had the house special for my first sandwich when it was being served over at the orient market and i was hooked on my first try as has been noted already these sandwiches are butt cheap 325 for the house special  dont bother with the combo to get a soda and chips youre not at subway and you can get that option everywhere else i liked the pork and shrimp spring rolls which for some reason are not on the big menu behind the counter and the porkfilled pastries but be prepared to wait longer if none are premade and hallelujah another place here sells boba tea now the selection is nowhere near as varied as yokozuna teriyaki but you do get better value for what is offered  when ive visited the place has been at best moderately busy as a result things have gone quite slow as its still relatively new its hard to say if its because of them still figuring things out or being understaffed and overwhelmed also somewhat odd is that you arent asked if the food is to be eaten there or not seems like a bit of a waste if im sitting at a table and am handed my food in a plastic bag when i dont need one tell them youre eating there if you arent asked and they should invest in some trays itll keep the tables cleaner too  they started offering pho but i didnt like it  congrats to the owners for bringing something different to the area and not just opening up some other standard vietnamese joint","4686":"went to pub and kitchen to eat some food and witness doc halladay make history the bar was great with a good amount of phils fans and good draft beer specials they also had dollar oysters which is enough to get me almost anywhere  i had the flying fish octoberfest whatever it was good i had the fish and chips which were excellent and the truffle dijonaisse was very very good be prepared for a very intense truffle flavor  the reviews that i read prior to entering this place really bashed the service i thought the service was great our waitress was really friendly and attentive filling our beers and water and not rushing us at all  definitely reccommend this place for a casual drink and some good food to go along with it  also a sweet logo","4687":"we love ru sans it is such a casual hole in the wall which makes the experience that much better  the sushi is not always the best in town however that small detail can be overlooked  the quantity is much greater than  virago and the price is much cheaper    we tend to get hot saki tempora sashimithe spicy edamame which is amazing and roll number 15    the only complaint is that they lost our reservation for valentines day and we had to sit at the bar  not very romantic for valentines day but we went with it","4690":"yes just y e s i really dont feel like anything more needs to be said but for those who like a little detail  waiting in line was no big deal it moved so quickly if you drive by and want to keep driving because of the line dont it isnt really as long as you think there were some sweetie students from belmont outside with guitars and it was some of the best music i heard during my whole trip chances are that will happen when you visit  the free coffee is a nice touch except for that the coffee is terrible seriously for reals no joking not being picky it isnt good that is the only reason pancake pantry get 4 stars from me instead of 5 breakfast joint you better serve good coffee  had a build your own omelette that was so great came with pancakes and chose to try the sweet potato come on ive read the reviewshow could i not they lived up to the hype the syrup that comes with them heaven cinnamon creme something just so good  so again  yes y e s   try it","4691":"my favorite place to pick up oysters choose carefully because there is a lot of variety and you get to try a shuck for free   ive also had the fish and chips  greasy flakey crispy fish and chips mmmm","4692":"before leaving no i had to get beignets  coffee  this particular location was outside of the no city limits but it was quiet cute and we didnt have to wait a ridiculously long time  the beignets were delish  we ordered just one order which has 3 beignets but i kinda wish i had my own personal orderoh well  the cafe du monde beignet mix i have at home just doesnt measure to the real thing  i want more","4694":"do yourself a favor and forget about the chain restaurants for fried chicken i stopped going to those places once i found this place their fried chicken is very yummy mashed potatoes not so much  they are very bland and so is the gravy but the fried chicken is very tasty and not as greasy as the other places","4696":"pretty decent boba here but it usually takes a long time for them to make it even when theyre not busy i like to sit at this locations lounge area when its not full and just chat with friends","4697":"had a fabulous breakfast amazing staff loved the bottles of water on the tables woke up early and arrived at 730am perfect time no wait and place only half full my only disappointmentthe use of thick airy doughy white bread in dishes  really gagging french toast dense flavorless after two bites amazing roasted tomato and goat cheese omelette  coffee strong and with fresh cream if there was no thick doughy white bread on the menu would be five stars","4699":"everything here is yummy i love their coffee of course and their donuts the pink ones or panini when i need a snack  only thing that keeps me from coming super regularly is its not the most welcoming atmosphere and a bit pricey for me but overall a quality shop for sure ps lavender latteso good","4700":"delicious very reasonable prices good portion sizes friendly service three of us went to dinner and paid 30  the only complaint i have is that i wish there were more vegetarian options","4701":"we went to this place with my mom i had the black bean burger it was great big portions my mom had the reuben she liked it my husband had a classic sandwich and ate every bite will be back","4703":"the falafel was out of this world great coffee great brunch   i would love to come back for dinner i hear their seafood is the best thing on the menu","4704":"i may be from philly but im not sure i can discern between good and bad water ice is there even really a difference regardless johns is tasty its close to where i live and its a cool scene really seems like the whole neighborhood is there some nights they dont have many flavors but the nofrill atmosphere is part of the appeal if youre in the hood on a hot day worth a stop fo sho","4707":"recently remodeled eegees on the south side near the airport and not too far from valencia and i10  almost always clean say about 9 out of 10  clean and usually lots of seats inside except for lunch times  there is some outdoor seating in a walled area  food is sandwiches but everyone comes for the frozen drinks  if you have not had an eegees drink then you have missed out on a excellent tucson tradition  you can get a mix with upto 3 flavors sometimes more but i dont recommend more than two    single lane drive through  i dont like how recently they park everyone even when there is no one behind you  i usually just pull to the front door and wait unless another car actually comes behind me  parking lot can be tight as it is shared with other businesses  biggest grips with eegees is the changing coupon policies  they used to take whatever but now they are strict on dates and annual coupon card  also i believe they had discounts at age 55 but now they raised it  they also got rid of the frito chilito after raising the price several times","4710":"let me tell you whatthose freaky looking chocolate bananas aside id eat anything from this place  i needed a cheesecake for a super bowl party and was down in philly not too far from here  i stopped by and their pastries and such looked good  i was especially impressed they were filling all the cannnoli by hand from a giant squeeze bag hanging from a rod  anyway the friendly lady behind the counter asked if i wanted a chocolate or regular cheesecake and i took the chocolate  she even wrote on it for me  it was also only 15 which was a bargain  the cake was so creamy and delicious i had two pieces once i got to the party  it was devoured promptly by the hungry football fans     next time im back in philly im going back here to get my sweet on","4712":"stopped by for a late lunch as i had a taste for something spicy we started with the table side guacamole and a ceviche different recipe used daily appetizer both of which were excellent we then moved on to street tacos and enchiladas mixtos for a main course  with a couple of margaritas to wash it all down  the entr\u00e9es were excellent and the drinks were exceptional im normally not a fan of margaritas but they just might have changed my mind   service was fast professional and politeand they used an ipad for the check out with the payment done by our waitress at the table  im not a fan of my card disappearing into the back room for 10 minutes   all in all a truly enjoyable dining experiencewell definitely be back","4713":"we had a large party of eight on a saturday night  our wait time was quite extensive 1 hour 30 minutes  the ice cream martinis were good but it was hard to pick one  i am not a huge chocolate fan  and it was in everything  i would have loved an over the top vanilla ice cream martini  for dinner i ordered the fig and bacon pie with the stutz salad  both were excellent   we will be back","4715":"i heard a lot of great things about this place and finally checked it out with a friend i found a friendly staff prompt service great happy hour specials and an excellent meal  a definite treat i had the portobello pretzel sandwich and while it might have been a tiny bit heavy on the goat cheese who can really complain about too much goat cheese beyond that the waitress was helpful in giving beer recommendations and the outdoor dining area was perfect for decompressing after work on a friday night ill definitely be back","4717":"the knitting factory is one of the only venues in the renotahoe area that consistently brings great shows for a reasonable price  as a result im willing to come time and time again to get my music fix    while the venue itself is a bit awkward think long and narrow the sound is killer and the staff particularly trisha are amazing  she handles huge crowds with grace patience and swiftness  even better she remembers what order the folks who walk up to the bar came in and she takes their drinks in order so no one feels like theyve been edged out or waited unfairly forever","4718":"i guess the food snob that i am took me down a level  this is the ultimate come down for my usual quest for finding non chained restaurants  this location is close to us and i am a sucker for coupons we get in the mail every so often  not that im giving lame remarks to cover my snobby food attitude but you cant beat their mc cafe drinks which are just like the fancy lattes you get at other nameless places which i wont mention  the lattes are better and half the price  i especially love the caramel latte with whipped cream  i wont eat a burger here but the egg mc muffin is shamelessly yummy the service is good and this location is always crowded kudos to mickey ds","4723":"food is excellent sides are massive but horrible customer service i waited nearly 2 hours for my food to be delivered not to mention i was on hold for 15minutes waiting to order i will pick up my food next time before i ever think of having it delivered always heard great things about this place glad i got to give it a try sadly i had to rate it a 4 because of the wait time","4727":"cheap quick delicious  gotta take it for what it is this is not gourmet indian food by any means and its not trying to be this place is great if you have a craving for indian food want something affordable and have limited time","4729":"dont like pancakes  try the grill cooks medley prepare to wait in line and if you park out back dont forget to get a ticket and put on your dash or you will be ticketed","4740":"good tour of the facilities it doesnt compare to the st louis brewery but definitely worth the trip if you live around the area decent selection of free samples after tour","4744":"our local pizza parlor was definitely good as usual i guess we usually dont have late night dinners it was good to order from this place we ordered and it arrived within half hour  we ordered the meat lovers assorted types of meats delicious  we ordered a thin crust and a regular crust both were great  love that we have a great local pizza place","4747":"stopped in here for breakfast and it was delicious we ordered the fleur de lis omelette which was great my sister and i split the food and it came out separated already which was definitely appreciated our server could have been more attentive but overall good experience will definitely be back","4748":"i love the old school home feel in this place its a definite step up from what im used to i came here a about 2 years ago and the place was ridiculously crowded i guess theres no real reason to be super crowded on a monday evening during fall break but this timeno crowdgood  i dig this place and they have a little redwood gatedcovered area you can work within outside  oh yeah they also have zapps chips i dont always want pastries at a coffee shop so thats a plus","4750":"excellent mexican restaurant hard to impress me with mexican food and they really exceeded my expectations tableside guacamole is a must","4752":"ive been to ghinis for breakfast a couple of times now the wait is always long at least during the breakfast hour on weekend but it is worth the wait the food is absolutely amazing and the crowd is super friendly i honestly dont have anything to criticize when it comes to the delicious food if i remember correctly i had a spinach and bacon omelet to die for the coffee was even out of this world perfect temperature fresh and strong  the next best part they let you have your dog on the patio so you tend to see very adorable puppies while eating your meal its a huge bonus in my book  now for the service kinda mediocre the last time i visited our server forgot to ring in half of two meals which was a bummer they ended up getting it put in and brought out fairly quickly after we said something but no apologies were made just a tad bit rude if i do say so myself everyone has off days though overall the food and puppy friendly patio is worth any mess up ive seen thus far","4756":"ru sans a great place to stop in and get sushi  we tried the sweet potato tempura roll and i forget what they were called but 29 and 39 on the menu  really liked 39 its grilled chicken jalepeno and thai peanut sauce  unique flavor we were very happy with our meal  music in there cracks me up its like an elevator in a european club","4759":"if you like soft serve ice cream yelod offers something different filipino flavours i had a swirl of ube purple yam and buko coconut in a cup it was served with a few fruit loops the coconut flavour dominated but the flavours are subtle nonetheless and not quite as sweet as other ice cream you can have it served in a black cone a regular cone or a cup the place is small so you might have to wait on line especially on a warm summer afternoon you can also get other treats and the service is very friendly","4761":"my favorite grocery store i think they are wonderful but they need more gluten free items like safeway","4762":"chicken pho was pretty delicious service was really nice the noodles were good though i wish i had a little bit more for the size i ordered but it still delicious","4764":"i really liked ritas and so did the daughter so much so that she still has yet to forgive me for not taking her here daily for the four days we were in the neighborhood  the service was fast and friendly the custards and italian ice were all delicious and the prices were all very reasonable but if i must choose i would go for the gelati it is customizeable to suit ones taste but we ordered ours with chocolate custard and the italian cherry ice the chocolate custard with the cherry shaved ice was simply bliss on a hot summer day  smooth italian ice smooth frozen custard is it a wonder we are ritas fans","4765":"overall  still working out some kinks but we liked the simple approach and prices were reasonable  our visit to mikes started off  wellthe atmosphere is simple and focused on a cowboy theme they seem to have removed some tables after taking over from the last restaurant which is a welcome change  it does not feel crowded or cramped also  inside and half of outside is all nonsmoking  yay  our server was great and very helpful  food  we liked the corn nuggets and chilli  the pulled pork sandwich and collards greens were also very good surprisingly the ribs were disappointing very rough and dry with not much flavor we sent them back and were told the kitchen says that is the way they were supposed to be after speaking to the manager when he stopped by our table to ask how everything turned out it seems that is not how the ribs are supposed to be and he encouraged us to try them another timeafter he has time to speak to the kitchen  seems like the managementowners are truly interested in making things right my replacement pulled pork sandwich was great  music if you like country music and dancing they still have it here we did not stay but line dancing lessons were starting at 730 on a thursday and they have live bands on occasionprobably weekends  give uncle mikes a try","4766":"lyndel our waitress was helpful and accommodating for our family and 2 year old daughter appreciated the care and many thanks","4767":"great frozen yogurt spot many flavors of soft serve hand serve and toppings high quality too this location even has a drivethru  i will be returning espically with their frequent customer programcard   highly recommend","4773":"i think they have the best pizza around here  we got an xl pizza and it was so big it hardly fit through the door i love there pizza order at least one a week","4777":"small store in downtown near the historic district foodery is a very cramped convenience store that happens to be stocked with 90 beer and maybe 10 food soda and custom sandwiches everything essentially is for sale as a single and there are no price tags which can get quite annoying but you do get what you pay for and that is quite an outstanding selection such as hair of the dog fiftyfifty eclipse cigar city lost abbey odd belgian stuff i usually stop in here each trip to philly and spend around 4050 on weird stuff i cant find anywhere else you can go up to the counter and ask for a price check on anything you want though that can be a little annoying dont come in here with a large group because only 45 people can fit in this place before it gets too cramped there isnt someone on staff to answer beer questions just ask the cashier essentially for anything i usually get a nice response also they have quite a bit of glassware for sale sandwiches in the back are apparently yummy but ive never gotten one","4778":"very good bagelslight but hearty with a huge selection of homemade cream cheeses service is awesome and timely tucked away in a little hidden shopping center in king of prussia worth the trip absolutely","4779":"one of my favorite food trucks on spruce so far it is refreshing to find a truck serving a variety of healthy options  i tried the chicken bahn mi or vietnamese sandwich though lacking in authenticity the baguette was delightful and the ingredients fresh i was a bit skeptical about the wasabi mayonnaise put into the sandwich since i am not a fan of wasabi but the wasabi flavor was minimal and actually worked quite well into the flavor combo for 5 it is a great deal and comes with a banana and a drink   many vegetarian and gluten free options available as well other menu items include more french sandwiches quinoa salads and berry salads  i definitely see this becoming one of my regular go to spots","4781":"amazing coffee small place but comfy  nice to see a coffee shop which isnt a starbucks","4782":"despite the fact that vientiane had run out of nearly everything i tried to order i am still giving it four stars  their food is that good their menu that extensive  but seriously order more tofu  this is west philly where more people are probably vegetarianvegan than not ugh  regardless of their failure to supply me with my necessary protein intake i still really enjoyed my meal  we started with the papaya and cucumber salad which was delicate and at the same time complex  then i had veggie pineapple fried rice and asked them to load up on the veggies because of the tofu outage  they obliged and the plate was delicious  i got spice level 45 and didnt find it very spicy but i may just have a high spice tolerance  for dessert we had the mango sticky rice and chocolate banana fried something or another both were delicious  the mango sticky rice had slices of fresh mango with coconut topping    i will be back  and hopefully they will have what i order","4783":"ppl this is a chain you really think this is quality food and dining first of all your in sicklerville so stop however if you know what to expect you wont be disappointed have a seat at the bar service is usually great if your lucky enough to go when kristyn kristen or dee are working they are awesome friendly and make the subpar food experience much better","4784":"went to this new location during the its 1st week   40 minute wait with a text message to tell us the table was ready  we could walk around the mall while waiting  big crowd but very well managed  our server christa was fabulous always attentive to our needs  the food came as as ordered fairly quickly for such a large crowd  we had the bbq chicken sandwich and the teriyaki chicken sandwich and substituted for sweet potato fries  both sandwiches were very good and the fries great  had a second helping of fries","4787":"we stopped here for fun the evening before our cruise and wow what a great addition of entertainment to the tampa area ive been to the hard rock casino in both biloxi and las vegas and if youve ever been to any of them you know what to expect the d\u00e9cor style and atmosphere of the casinos are very similar with famous memorabilia displays rock music and cute  funny quotes everywhere one addition i did especially appreciate here were all the dining options in addition to the food court with variety of diverse options theres a sushi bar and buffet upstairs a casual caf\u00e9 and another asian quick eats next to a separate area of baccarat tables im sure im missing some more dining options here but those are the ones i spotted easily  i grabbed a quick meal at the asian place in the food court and for 10 i ended up with a pile of foodenough to feed two people and then some great deal if you are hungry  this casino is also huge the entrance is in the middle and there are slot machines on either side upon walking in there are also separate rooms with more slot machines nonsmoking slot rooms and various other rooms for if coming with a group its very easy to get lost and not be able to find them also pay attention to parkingwhile waiting i noticed several people were asking about how to get to which garage which can be tricky once youve had some drinks in you overall a fun enjoyable experience with quality comparable to the other hard rock casinos","4792":"updating my last review from a year ago still go to this place  my friends and i love the boba pad thai and the pho is pretty good not the best ive had but its good the shaved ice is the best too yummmmmm","4793":"yummy yummy yummmy gelato in my tummy  amazing looking gelatos thru the display windowsi just want to try thisand try thatand try those  i sampled the irish whiskey hazelnut and cappuccino all were delishesp the hazelnut i would get thatif only did i not spot my all time favoritesalted caramel  best salted caramel ice cream i had was in sf birite creameryso ill go for the gelato version  got a scoop of salted caramel gelatocame in a nice little paper cup with a piece of cigarette cookie stuck on the side for some personality  flavor was good not as strong burnt caramel taste  a little surprise as i ate half of my gelatothere was a square of caramel chocolate yum  it was goood  i want another and another and another  it gets crowded fast  we were in and by the time we got outflocks of people came","4794":"come here quite often   far and away my kids favorite  they love the kids meals    workers were good and polite   the food was good   typical panda meal","4795":"i have only had delivery from fresco and the staff who answers the phone are always polite and helpful i love that the vegan pizzas have daiya cheese on them my favorite is a the veggie with double vegan cheese yum yum yum delivery times are quick and unlike another pizza joint in town this one delivers east of country club","4796":"ordered from here via grubhub on a whim 10pm on new years night had a difficult order because of lack of options via grubhub but they did everything we asked them to delivered quickly too good za this is the first time ive had pizza delivered since i moved to the city 9 months ago and i wouldnt hesitate to order from brooklyn pizza again","4798":"delicious food but the for some reason the party that was leaving when we got there had gotten in a dispute with the staff not something you want to see at a place your trying for the first time","4801":"convenient location for usf students and theyre open late they dont have a lot of seating and on busy nights theres going to be a bit of a wait since they only have 4 cold plates  you can watch them make it which is always cool they always have a good variety of flavors  ive had the matcha strawberry and the bangkok summer  thai tea and lychee and you get a free sauce and three toppings i love the mochi pocky and condensed milk if you havent had rolled ice cream before the texture is a lot more dense and solid than normal ice cream its definitely a shareable portion  overall tasty cold ice cream  and its a cute place to take friends for novelty dessert just wish there was more seating and it gets a little crowded during busy nights","4803":"the parking is a pain here at this location when we walked in there were a few tables taken the place looked very clean but we waited a bit at the register before being acknowledged  i was busy reviewing the menu trying to figure out what i wanted  i ordered the half chopped salad moms recommendation and the 12 caprese sandwich the salad had luscious avocado crispy bacon blue cheese scallions chicken  tomatoes it was delicious very generous and filling high quality ingredients the sandwich was delicious with tomato basil arugula lettuce on a flat bread also amazing the meal came with chips too   the desserts were oh sooo tempting looking i abstained it wasnt easy  if im in the area i would definitely go back  i feel that the value is very good i felt like this was comparable to panera  panera is good but i leave there hungry i would choose this restaurant over panera any day","4804":"great service and great the food came out quickly and the staff was constantly checking on us you get plenty of dumplings with the poppers appetizers and the steak pho has so much food and they didnt skimp on the steak and noodles so it isnt just broth","4805":"this is one of those odd restaurant locations that can throw you off because its inside a odd business location the only other one like it i know is the barn at lucerne  when you walk in with various businesses located there and then there is patio with a businesses meet up type thing and you go this way to enter the restaurant its just odd with an older d\u00e9cor feeling  not sure what to expect i was then actually surprised the food was as good as it was   you do have that italian service that goes with it not anything high end more like being served by your family or neighborhood friends but good service regardless  on our plates this night were the house salad pretty good tilapia very good the strip steak pretty good and the tiramisu very good which is hard to do with tiramisu      overall its closer to a 3 than it would be a 5 so it was a decent experience and not outstanding but i am glad i had the chance to try","4806":"excellent service  very good bread limited menu but our rabbit and pasta rigatoni with eggplant  were delicious    my friend raved about her swordfish   serious negatives include dreadful coffee  sent it back and it was no better the noise level and the heat  the restaurant is small and the tables were crammed in     my friend has been there a number of times and really likes this place  this was my first experience","4808":"lets get some ehh things out of the way first the restaurant is small  i feel like im going to bump into someones chair if we go on a busy night  second the bathroom needs some improvement  yayy onto the positive stuff food is always tasty customer service is great i love how the waitresses are on top of the menu  drinks","4810":"i am always on the hunt for a good poke place where ever i go this place from the outside looks like its located next to ha long bay but its actually part of ha long bay we did walk in from the poke side but sat in ha long bay side incase we wanted something from their menu as well we ended up sticking to poke i ordered the poke bowl with salmon tuna cucumber jalapeno sesame seeds and seaweed flakes i wanted to keep mines as simple as possible for the flavor i chose poke spice and spicy mayo for 1095 it was good and the portion was good it didnt leave me full but i didnt leave hungry it came with a side of shrimp chips which brought back childhood memories i used to love seeing them get fried up and expand into chips definitely a good place to stop in for poke i really liked that they had multiple flavors to choose from but i really hope they would consider having brown rice as well","4812":"arrive right at opening early am for quick service without the line  quality breakfast but i wouldnt stand outside for more than 10 minutes to wait for it  i had the tennessee ham  eggs with a side of pancakes","4813":"had the cowboy grilled cheese bagel   asiago cheese bagel with cheddar provolone and roast beef it was supremely delicious   their service was quick friendly and efficient   that being said  way overpriced  it cost almost 18 for 2 of those sandwiches what absolutely ridiculous   if you have already gone through security and need breakfast  this is a good option i love me some starbucks coffee but their bagels arent very good","4814":"nice atmosphere professional staff emphasis is on pastry and they do a good job i would suggest more options that appeal to vegetarians though","4817":"went on wednesday for dinner with a friend turns out that its half price bottles of wine all night got a bottle of torrontes and ordered the potatoes octopus and cipollini to share   the potatoes with bacon jam that were recommended by our server were delicious but when we got the 14 octopus we were pretty disappointed by the serving size very small for the price but it was very good the pizza was great and pretty big for two people it was just the right amount of food  really great atmosphere as well definitely will be back soon for half price wine","4818":"the best carribean food truck in city jerk chicken is very good been a fan over 2 years i make sure i find them at every festival to take a platter home","4819":"took my family for a little sunday evening treat and thought wed give this place a try everyone loved it  we will definitely come back again    location was easy to find clean and good seating options that also included outside tables it was like going to a small ice cream shop  we parked on the street in front   the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because they had very limited drink options hot coffee iced coffee hot chocolate and milk water was free you definitely get thirsty eating this tasty treat   as other reviewers have mentioned it was very filling  i got two scoops but one would have been plenty i ate about half and i will have the leftovers tomorrow   i got one scoop of chocolate chip and one scoop of peanut butter both were good but chocolate chip was my favorite   if you are looking for a sweet treat i definitely recommend giving this place a try","4821":"besito has some absolutely delicious food we sat outside and enjoyed a breeze very rare in florida before an evening rain store its clear they are still working out some kinks in their service but they are pretty new so i can understand a bit   we ordered the table side guacamole and it took a little bit longer than acceptable to get to our table also they cant prep the table side guacamole outside if this matters to you they didnt tell us this when we ordered but without even a peep from us about it the manager stopped by our table and apologized and dropped off a card for a free guacamole on our next visit   the food was delicious between the guacamole fresh chips and my entree i cant remember exactly the name of what i had but the waitress likened it to a seafood lasagna with tortillas instead of pasta it was cheesy creamy and delicious ive also had one of their margaritas on a previous visit that was phenomenal   all in all id go back again they have the backbone to be a great restaurant service will hopefully get better","4823":"good family spot  pizza is good not great  the greek salad is very tasty  can get bargains on some nights with 1 medium pizza  service has always been good  the chocolate chip cookies are nice treat   used to be free but now they charge ","4825":"theyre cool peoples and they always have a good deal on pbr or whatever i decide to grab im not a fancy beer person so it doesnt matter what esquisitelybrewed seasonal special edition flavored ale they have","4826":"burgers are varied and interesting boozy shakes are delicious atmosphere is comfortable and fun with servers to match on occasion my medium rare comes to the table medium but otherwise ive always had good experiences here fried pickles are yummy too","4830":"love schlafly it was always a mustdo when i came to visit my boys fam and now that ive moved here from first milwaukee then chicago i am grateful to have such a wonderful place to go get good beer its really nice in the summer as they have live music and a nice patio area they also have a farmers market here in the summer supplying the area with fresh local produce they also make note of where your meal came from which is always cool to see  because for most things its out of the midwest  go local   i like all their beers but my two faves are the coffee stout and the raspberry heffe definitely staples in the appropriate season you can easily sample a bunch of their beers if you go for a tour i think between my boyfriend and i we tried them all and then some we also made good with the bartender who was cool giving us a few extra  hah if tours bore you they are also more than willing to give you a free taste of whatever youd like to try up at the bar to help you decide  if youre looking for a laid back place to go get some good food and excellent beer definitely give schlafly a try","4832":"we are regulars its one of our places for sushi rolls very clean place i think they need to change up the menu a little more often i personally dont care for much of the hot foods just dont like the sauce soups are great i would tell you to go","4835":"i tried dream tea house for the first time last night when practically dying of thirst at west edmonton mall and cant wait to visit again i ordered smile a strawberryrose slush with lychee jelly and found it perfectly sweet and flowery with tons of lychee floating around the bottom of the cup my boyfriend whos been wishing for watermelon juice all summer long had his dreams come true with a fresh watermelon juice avec plenty of tapioca on special that day our drinks both came in at under 5 good value considering the size","4837":"i was in the mood for pizza so i stopped in  at mod pizza in oro valley az and ordered a pizza for takeout wow the service was great from placing my order to the finish product it was a great pizza for the money thanks to the entire staff great job","4838":"this place is adorable the decor is rustic modern and incredibly cozy theres a nice outdoor seating area the bathrooms are clean i got a yerba mate green tea and my hubby got a cappuccino both were delightful we will definitely be back","4839":"great food love all their options just dont expect a quick inandout during lunchtime rush this location is particularly busy around noon","4843":"the line wraps around the back of the store but moves relatively quickly the chewy pralines are delicious as were the tourtes they package up the candies for travel which is a great option for tourists coming from afar friendly service too make sure you try a sample before you buy","4844":"first time costumer and i really enjoyed myself good staff and very clean great flavors but i still felt there could have been more but thats me","4846":"for what it serves it is awesome  i waited in line for about 45 minutes during the last manayunk street food festival to get a taste of this food trucks  im not privy to food trucks on a normal basis because of my work location so i considered it a special occasion to wait in line for this  when i got to the front of the line i placed an order for a large deep fried curds and some sauce to go with it  the fried cheese curds were absolute bliss  cooked to the right consistency warm gooey fried goodness  the only thing that hampered my visit was the next time i was the truck there was absolutely no line  wish they could move faster for the big events","4850":"good brew and good food  have been there a couple of time and never disappointed","4851":"first of all  the servers and workers are all very nice and friendly the location is in a half seedy half upandcoming neighborhood theres not a ton on the menu so peruse it beforehand to make sure theres something you can eat i got the breakfast burrito and it was tasty a little bit sloppy and hard to eat but thats better than a dry and gross burrito   all the ingredients appeared fresh and they seem to care about the product they are putting out so give it a try","4852":"zimmers is the place to go when the weather is nice and you wanna sit on the lakefront with a 10 pound bag of crawfish or a shrimp po boy and a daiquiri this place a been in my neighborhood ever since i can remember and theyve always been good people zimmers is a good spot to check out during fish fry season","4853":"tower grove farmers market is definitely my favorite farmers market in st louis every saturday morning the wife and i drive down to tower grove it has always been such an uplifting experience talking with the farmers picking out our own vegetables andor meat and then coming home and figuring out what to make its also fulfilling to see how the options change across the seasons and to alter our menu the tomatoes often are so incredible that we dont even put anything on them we get cage free chicken and eggs and can never say no to shiitake mushrooms from the ozark folks companion baguettes with pretzel croissants as a snack are highly recommended folk music playing around 10 just adds to the experience   our biggest complaint becoming a little too popular where now there are lines there is a free yoga from 910 and once it lets out theres a flood on the market i am really happy for the small local businesses there as business must be great but it has dampened the experience slightly we just need to go earlier","4857":"its the closest thing u have to an authentic taiwanese cuisine in the middle of reno its not too bad the service ok the place is clean  i got the pork chop over rice and next time ill come back for their beef noodle soup it makes me feel closer to home when i visit with my mom our server spoke mandarin too so it helps when ordering the real good stuff ","4858":"a nashville staple  dont let the long lines scare you away they typically move pretty quickly at any rate once you get inside youll be glad you stuck it out because their breakfast is among the best in town  to be fair at the end of the day theyre just serving pancakes  but as pancakes go these are the best youll find    they offer a ton of options many of which are pretty elaborate  fair warning dont come here with a packed agenda  you will be far too stuffed to do much of anything after a full meal","4859":"really enjoy going here omelets are big and packed with fillings great price this is a weekly spot for breakfast","4860":"the gelato is just okay unless you get the drink where they pour espresso over it then its delicious but what really sets this place apart are the drinks and the atmosphere the london fog is rich creamy and absolutely perfect theres a more social area downstairs with more private quiet study areas upstairs which i wish i had known about while i was in school the outdoor patio is super adorable this is a great spot for studying dates catching up with friends anything they have a selfserve water station and plenty of seating","4862":"my favorite coffee shop in town decent food nice crowd even though im not to fond of the mommy group that sometimes takes over at lunch in the back and expects everyone else to get out of their way and the best chai in town my one complaint it gets way too hot in the summer","4863":"love zacs burgers in aston so since i was in area stopped in for lunch here and a snack later  ordered rhe zac pac 4 burgers 4 boneless wings added fries and fountain soda for 19 total  clean friendly not all tvs had sports on them a positive for me  staff was fast to wipe tables when customers left  mens room clean and stocked positive","4866":"this place has great produce  for a small shop certain items can get pricey but there is a good range of healthy options  i found organic pears for 169 per pound  and they are tasty  milk cartons are an average of 450 for organic milk  they even have calestravano olives the bright green juicysweetsalty ones  great options of snacks  organic cereal can even be found on sale 2700  not bad knowing that cereal these days is an average of 450  great go to shop but i would probably still need to go to whole foods to do the bulk shopping  this market is great for a quick stop  ps  they also have a hot food counterdeli  food is fantastic but pricey  mushrooms are amazing","4869":"ive only been here once so far but i enjoyed it  it was packed when we were here but we were able to sit outside which was preferable anyway since the weather was beautiful  i took the crowds as a sign that the coffee was good and i was right way to go carissa  i find that many places that have fancy coffee make it look and taste way too dark  the iced caramel coffee here was noticeably caffeinated but didnt taste too strong and acidic so that was a real treat  i also appreciated the offering of vegan options in food and drinks    really nothing negative to say here  someday i shall try some other foodsdrinks but for now at least im a fan","4870":"always a good quick fix when you have a sweet tooth the eegees drinks are perfect for the hot az weather the sandwiches are bomb the fries are bomb and its just a good comforty az tradition that you have to love and get whenever you have a chance","4872":"ate here with the guys for lunch because were in st louis visiting and this place was awesome to me i loved the contemporary vibe the restaurant gave off with its brilliant decor the food was great the burgers were extremely succulent and the shakes were on point hospitality was good no complaints there","4874":"we sat on the patio on a saturday night and despite the noise of the train passing by it was a fairly quiet atmosphere cocktails were good but everything took a little while to arrive  i ordered a pork chop that was awesome i highly recommend it huge portion and really delicious   overall maynards was good but not super memorable it would be a great pick for a more traditional crowd where theres something for everyone","4875":"fantastic snowballs with custom flavors that youll be comparing to any snowball you get anywhere else the only reason theyre missing a star is because the hours have changed hours are wednesdaysunday from 200 to 800pm these hours were not decided upon with the customer in mind but hey whos getting a snowball before 12 anyway","4878":"love this place grab a quick bowl of tasty pho and grab a bahnmi to go not the most authentic flavors but close enough for the price my only complaint is that bok choy was the only veggie in the veggie pho cmon now can i get a carrot or piece of broccoli please","4880":"stopped in after a day at adventure island the food was good and they had fast friendly service counter service no kids meals","4881":"the food is nothing short of spectacular everything and i do mean everything cause ive had the whole menu is great the staff is super chill and very pleasant adequate parking available it is byo and the setting is small and intimate only reason i took star off is the pricing seems very high and there was just 1 tv without cable not good during a nba playoff game but otherwise the food makes up for the minor miscues","4886":"a very cute fun little farm we picked our pumpkins found cider donuts visited the holiday shop and played in the play areaanimal farm my only complaint is that it can be quite an expensive trip especially if you want to enter the play area","4889":"we had passed by here a few times but never came in but finally made it today the food is surprisingly good the braised beef noodle soup braised pork with rice popcorn chicken taiwanese chow mein achoy are all very good will definitely come back again the next time we hit reno","4890":"spring rolls werent our favorite chicken panang was awesome tho  some of the best ive had  ill be back forsure great lil spot","4893":"perfect stop on a hot summer day or night ted drewes is a classic st louis staple with the best custard around they had a huge variety of flavors and you are able to mix flavors and make it your own there was a huge swarm of people when we pulled up but the line moves really quick and we got our treats way faster than we expected i ordered the reeses flavor and it was great i think next time i visit i will order one of the fruit flavors because those looked amazing   when you visit be prepared to struggle to find parking and wait in line but its worth it will definitely be stopping by ted drewes again soon","4896":"all through senior year people would ask what i was going to miss the most from st louis when i packed up and moved to boston or melbourne as it turned out for first semester i gave the cheesy answers of friends family and just the familiarity with the city then i realized i wouldnt have ted drewes or any other of my favorite hang outs   i returned home from aboard three weeks ago and just didnt have the chance to get down to ted drewes until today it was just like how i left it with the addition of the holiday specials as many before have said the possibilities are endless one thing i didnt pick up in the first few reviews is that no one mentioned how cheap it is for the amount of ice cream you get so heres the scoop a mini their small which its not  i rarely finish a mini is 210 then their regular at just over 3 which is at least 12 or 16oz then the large comes in at 420 i think and its bigger than a venti coffee from starbucks    now why was i eating ice cream with my family in the middle of december because we also got the hanukkah bush  christmas tree today silly yes all through december ted drewes is home to the absolute best trees and wreaths the trees range in price from 50 to 200 depending on the breed and footage but they are worth it living in u city we have many other options and without i6440 getting to ted drewes this year was not easy but would werent going to back down on our favorite trees and icecream   in the holiday months i opt for the great pumpkin  which is literally a pie of pumpkin pie blended into their vanilla custard with whipped cream its amazing   in the summer friends and i pile into one car usually my suv and head on down to eat icecream in the true stl fashion sitting in the trunk of my car in those times i get a simple chocolate chip concrete friends get the hawaiian or reeses and strawberry or cookie dough or pineapple ect","4900":"great burgers today  ice cold beer  awesome french fries   may be my new burger joint","4901":"little over priced but great quality food limited parking some mosquitoes when i went got bit up but overall get the fries and the quesadilla","4902":"hellas is where i go to get  great greek food especially when they have there greek dining music and dancing  outside by the marina    i like the atmosphere and there food is always consistent  which is very important to me  sponge docks is a great fun place to go out for the evening ","4903":"the raving facebook reviews about freshness brought me through the front door  i have to say its true best cupcakes ive ever had the fresh ingredients really set them apart from other bakeries only 2 cons which wouldnt keep me from going they dont list prices inside  there is a ton of sweet icing atop these little gems weve gotten a dozen on two separate occasions now  they have been amazing","4904":"henrys reminds me of a coffee shop youd pop into in a little town on the east coast before walking 5 more steps to the beach it is quaint welcoming and inviting so naturally that makes me think of vacation   the food is delicious  and theres quite a variety of breakfast and lunch choices available at all times as well as brunch options on the weekend a chicken caesar wrap at 1030 am sure no problem at henrys they also have a decent amount of baked goods to choose from   i had an arnold palmer to drink since i wasnt feeling coffee on this particular day and that was great and refreshing i glanced at the drink menu and overall thought those prices were pretty high so overall impressed with the food prices and think those are a great value but feel the price point on the coffee is a little high  i still think i would give their coffee a shot as this is a cute and quiet place to get work done or catch up with friends ill definitely be back  ease of parking on east street also a plus","4907":"this place doesnt look at the fancy from the outside but in side its beautiful my and my bff went here and i felt like i was on a date low lights candles very relaxing place esp with the slow jazz on we both had sushi it was fabulous and the service was good fast and friendly the entrees were a bit expensive but good i had the steak with pineapple and she had the rack of lamb which she devoured  i will def be back here soon","4908":"we parked at the freret street parking lot to grab some lunch and noticed this colorful building on the way back to the car  excellent find  the gentleman working behind the counter was friendly and informed us that the ice cream several flavored to choose from was home made  home made  it was delicious especially on a warm summer day we will be back to ice cream 504","4909":"public notice heaven on earth is located at 2204 washington avenue in the form of a mini oreo mousse pie the light airy oreoy mousse is surrounded by two fresh moist chocolate cakes each bite prompted an mmmm and i experienced a bout of sadness when i realized i had devoured it all so quickly    i had been lusting after kermits baked goods after they first caught my eye on instagram dining partner and i decided to take advantage of a rainy saturday to make the trek out to kermits for some welldeserved treats in addition to the mini oreo mousse pie we decided to be really fat and split a chocolate croissant which was absolutely divine dining partner also had a mini smores pop tart which would not be purchased again the pop tart was dense and not nearly as flavorful as the other two goodies i cant wait to return during warmer weather and devour a homemade ice cream sandwich 15 minimum on credit cards debit cards no minimum","4910":"chipotle is the one reason behind my freshman 15  i love it and hate it for that reason  almost 10 years later i am ready to rekindle my relationship with the burrito that absorbed so many of my feelings and alcohol    i am a mature healthyish adult with self restraint  this time we are going to have a healthy relationship  never mind i ate the whole thing  my veggie burrito was as good as i remember and better than qdoba  i think its the rice with the pieces of cilantro oh and the veggies are better too  i dont plan on being back too often but its good to know my comfort food is so close again    funny observation  i would say that almost half the people in there were college aged girls  coincidence","4911":"this is pretty much one of my favorite stores in the city and ive found some really great deals recently for gifts and for myself i dont think ive ever left this place emptyhanded   besides enjoying the historic architectural details i routinely find the staff to be helpful and knowledgeable whether im getting something  or  or just asking questions about something i can only afford to add to my wishlist for now   ive only had them gift wrap my purchases a few times and unlike another reviewer here perspective dude first world problems im a little more forgiving when it comes to a free service when its busy weekends holiday time weekends at holiday time theres going to be a big line and the people who stay in it are the ones who are going to get their things wrapped before the people who leave it behind for later pickup at least thats what id expect if i continue to wait if you ask theyll probably just give you paper to wrap it yourself though lord knows it will look like crap if i do it or you can go down the street to papyrus beautiful wrapping job but they charge","4913":"after reading the many positive reviews i was anxious to try this place out   although i was prepared for takeout on this visit i was surprised that it is only takeout   this is one of my pet peeves about yelp ie that  this is not clear in the survey questions  but i digress  everything from here was tasty   the baguette is good but not as good as others available around the city  it is pleasantly chewy but very dense   i would rate it 4 stars   croissants were great and large 45 stars and available in ham and cheese chocolate and plain   i also sampled a variety of pastries  key lime lemon cheesecake square and coconut all strong 4s  coffee is also available for takeout but they also had vietnamese iced coffee ready for takeout   yum 5 stars and a great surprise on a summer day    parking can be challenging  service is great","4914":"got lunch here oysters crawfish and beer it was awesome  oysters were huge and salty  crawfish had good size and were soaked not sprinkled they had a good spice to them that didnt burn up your lips","4918":"a great addition to my farmers market experience  we started by enjoying the fresh vegetables fruits and more in the market itself then we complemented our experience with a cobb salad and amfm  it was just a fresh and delicious  large enough for two and at a reasonable price  the service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was enjoyable and comfortable  stop in","4920":"this companion is close to work so i dropped in the other day for a sammy my first thought was  its small it gets super crowded at lunch and is also small i wouldnt want to eat in unless you want hoards of people around and people watching you eat and begging with their eyes for you to finish already so they can take your table parking is actually ok since there is a side street that is easy to park on and walk since its on the corner   that being said companion has awesome bread and sandwiches i love the cocktail party  brie apples and apricot marmalade on some sort of walnut bread toasted yum it doesnt come with anything but you can make it a bag lunch easily the soups and entrees come with a roll or bavarian pretzel on the side i highly recommend the pretzel they are so good i buy them in schnucks or straubs frequently warm them up and they make a great snack companion also has local products like fitzs its pretty quick once you order to get your food   i was pleasantly surprised to see that the foil they wrapped my sandwich in kept it really warm when i got to work and was ready to eat it i also got a frosted sugar cookie which i didnt like much the frosting was kind of gummy tasting and the consistency of the cookie wasnt great that being said there are a lot of cool designs on them   this is definitely a primo sandwich stop","4922":"i should probably give seminole hard rock a review back in my going out days this was a regular stop on the weekends  center bar great place to start the evening centrally located in the center duh of the casino offering a birds eye view of the action  lobby bar the place to get the night off and running three great ladies serving the drinks behind the round circular bar w dj joey jam spinning the tunes no cover charge  floyds 3am time to go home not at hard rock head to floyds to see best local and national djs spin to 6am sign up on floyds text mailing list for reduced cover  green room need a bite to eat b4 you head home the green room is open 24 hrs","4923":"just like the name states everything is so fresh my daughter first turned me on to sofresh we stopped by today to pu a couple of salads for lunch i had the signature and she had the med salad with chicken i ve how they pack the protein in a separate container the balsamic dressing is incredible   the only downside the strip mall its located in soooooo busy can never get a spot and even just dropping her off to run in to pick up the to go order was a hassleactually a complete cluster   i love the salads and will check to see if they are on uber eats to avoid the hassle getting in and out of the parking lot","4926":"loved the breakfast here i dont think this place needs anymore good reviews because we were there on a cold morning in january and it was packed in fact thats the only thing i didnt love about it  its a bit cramped and noisy and the tables are sort of crammed together in an effort to squeeze in as many eager diners as possible i get it its the french quarter and most places are on the small side but anywaythe food was delicious about as good a breakfast as youre going to find anywhere a bit on the expensive side but i think thats another thing you just have to expect when visiting here great food and good service ill go back if the lines not too long ","4928":"ive eaten here twice and was impressed by the food both times  the first time i had the california blt sandwich and really liked it  the portion size was big so i took the second half togo and when i ate it several hours later the bread was still pretty firm and not totally gone to mush  you can add fries for 2 which i did and they were okay but i wish there were other healthier options  maybe there were but i didnt see them on the menu  ive also eaten their beet salad which i picked purely because of the ingredients listed on the menu truffled goat cheese toasted walnuts pesto drizzle and sherry vinaigrette  amazing am i right and didnt fully realize just how many beets were in this darn thing until it showed up  it was still really good and i gobbled it down even though im not exactly a fan of beets but theyre supposedly wicked healthy for you and eating them drenched in cheese nuts and pesto is the best its gonna get  i have not tried any of their famous desserts so reserving the potential fifth star for them  bottom line i work nearby so ill come back for lunch but i doubt id go too far out of my way to come here on a weekend","4929":"ive had a lot of delicious mole in my life and the liverys mole on chicken was pretty flavorless it tasted mostly just like cookedcharred chicken the brussel sprouts on the other hand were the best ones ive ever tasted and the restaurant itself is a beautiful place i am so glad we have another lovely and hip restaurant in town hoping the food is better next time","4931":"hey kids did you know that vietnam was colonized by the french and when the vietnamese wanted independence the us supported the french who were still clinging to colonialism even after wwii so the people seeking independence the viet minh got the backing of the commie people in china and anyone who was catholic or liked to eat french bread went south or eventually moved to the us just kidding the commie people like french bread too   and who wouldnt love baguettes crusty chewy great for sandwiches just slap some pate on there along with some chili peppers cilantro pork products you have a masterpiece what kind of creole fusion cuisine is this its the taste of two great culinary cultures in a mashup  ive never been to the vietnamese markets in california so it was a treat to have this place open up in boise the bread is baked at the orient market and it is excellent im hooked on the house special with the pate and the jalapenos kids might want to skip the hot peppers  my daughter wanted to know why the menu said the sandwiches come with egg mayo cuz dats what mayo is kido  an egg and lemon juice colloid  the bbq pork is tasty the chicken is so so i have got to try the cajun shrimp   speaking of cajun  the last time i had a beignet like they serve here i was in new orleans at cafe du monde  actually these are kind of leathery and oily kind of reminds me of the fusion asian grill  krispy kreme combo out in meridian   so raise a glass of boba tea the thai tea is my fav and celebrate mixing things up","4932":"not too sure why im reviewing a subway theyre all the same it basically comes down to service  this location is larger than most and has adequate seating  the parking is cramped and really snug if you have a larger vehicle  the service was exceptional  the homeless guy not so much  not sure why they didnt just ask him to leave  you would of got 5 stars if i didnt have to tell you the master build for my sandwich","4934":"sandwiches were okay mac and cheese was oily and had a funny taste to it   im giving it 4 stars because nashville needs more deli options in general so 3 stars for the food and 4th star is for the fact that it exists as an option and it is better than panera and is open late so if you want a sandwich for dinner the hours are convenient","4937":"unique donut flavors and delicious breakfast sandwiches   district donuts is a quirky restaurant with yummy breakfast options the donut flavors change regularly so dont get too attached to a specific flavor   i have yet to try their sliders but have heard good things","4939":"had some for a building holiday party very good food meatballs and sweet potatos were delicious","4941":"after eating here a few more times it certainly deserves better than the original meh i gave it  ill go with 4 stars as the burgers are indeed pretty good and the place continues to be clean friendly and rarely crowded","4943":"i personally had only ordered the homicide boneless and regular and i absolutely love it it is a bit pricey for the portion though but that doesnt stop me from getting my usual but please be cautious if your tolerance level for spicy food is low because the homicide wings are extremely spicy buttasty lol","4944":"this is a pretty good place to get some breakfast food  city limits is located a bit out of the way in bellevue as you have to drive into a neighborhood area and over the train tracks to get here  however the somewhat isolated location its a random strip mall surrounded by suburban houses provides good parking spots  its located very close to the train tracks so if you are sitting outside when the train comes by it might get a bit loud however there are only a few seats outside   it can get a bit busy in the morning but the line moves pretty quickly  the people seem friendly  i wasnt blown away by friendliness in my few visits but i wasnt turned off by them either  its a standard friendly affair i guess   ive been here a few times so these reviews are based on a variety of visits    onto the food vegetarian for the most part hence only vegetarian options discussed  tomato basil soup  probably one of the better soups ive had in a while  i love the taste the consistency and the pieces arent too chunky  i got takeout and they had it in a styrofoam cup that has an inside lid i dont know what its called but the lid if fitted inside of the cup instead of over it helping to keep more warmth in which meant my soup was hot even after a 15 minute journey home  the soup comes with a bread that is allright    california banini  essentially an egg and cheese bagel the sandwich tastes pretty good  its better than the fast food options available in the area for sure  i also believe the eggs were just egg whites i dont remember tasting egg yolk in the sandwich   you do get a choice of bagels if you ask them    egg and cheese croissant  pretty much a straight forward egg and cheese on a croissant  you get a choice of eggs and i believe more topping if you choose but i didnt want it to be complicated    vegetarian delight  a sandwich that i found to be disappointing  its bread hummus cucumbers and onions  it just doesnt stand out and the cucumbers tend to be the main focus of the sandwich  tasted pretty bland to me since the hummus wasnt really standing out and the onions were few and far in between    i think this is a good place to try out for breakfast but i didnt love their regular day options  it seemed a bit flat to me  the breakfast baninis end at 10 am   i love the tomato soup here so thats probably going to be the one thing that brings me back  the breakfast food is good enough that ill order it when im there   ill recommend it to most people if they want to try a new place for breakfast","4946":"first time at snola and i must say that the snowballs are incredible the cheesecake stuffed snowballs are quite rich but theyre very good i enjoyed every second of it hope to return again soon","4948":"i was finally able to try this place after what seemed like the eternal renovation  i drive past each day on my way home so was thrilled to see an open sign    ill begin with the decor  it is traditional spanish  looks very new and crisp  the counter has 25 cent candy to choose from as you would see in a traditional family owned mexican restaurant  its a big place so bring your friends     while we waited for our food we feasted on the chips and salsa yummy stuff  the menu is extensive with a nice lunch menu on the back  i ordered 2 tacos one beef one chicken and they were both quite tasty  the rice and beans were what i would expect  nothing out of this world but definitely not bad either  i should note the lunch menu is not available for the reduced price on sunday only mondaysaturday    the wait staff is very friendly but it takes a while to get service  we had to track someone down to take our order and drink refills    we wanted to try the tres leche cake but they were out of it  just gives me a reason to go back again  i have a feeling i will be visiting often","4952":"this place is really good lots of variety they had 3 different types of veggie burgers and a lot of topping options i had guadalupe i think and it was amazing as is but even better with pickled jalape\u00f1o everything had lots of flavor be careful with the build your own burgers though all the toppings and options can add up and get pricey your better off ordering one of the ones already on the menu overall really really good meal","4953":"great place for a quick breakfast if youre staying on canal do yourself a favor and walk down to this place the staff is friendly and the serving sizes are hangover friendly","4960":"i came here for lunch with a few friends the place was packed but we were able to push together a few tables the staff was quick and friendly did not have any trouble  everything i had was good but nothing special i ordered the frenchie sandwich it was good but not enough sprouts on the sandwich the bread was good but i should have gotten it toasted there was a total of 10 in my group and we all received our food quickly if i went back i would probably do the soup  sandwich combo   for dessert i got the gooey butter cake it was really good and a good sized portion it was so large that i ended up sharing it with everyone in my group  overall i would recommend this to others and go back there myself","4962":"egg  cheese on onion bagel and hot tea this is one of the better einsteins locations and the bagels are better than bread co","4963":"moved over here not too long ago and was worried about the lack of decent pizza places and wasnt expecting much from foxs den after reading the reviews ordered a deluxe though and was really surprised at how good it was its not going to blow your mind or anything but this is definitely a better pizza than you can get from the likes of dominos or pizza hut had them a couple of times now and the pizzas were both well made and tasty definitely recommend this place for anyone in the area","4964":"maple street is not on my usual weekend path but ive stopped by this bakery the last few times ive been over that way  delicious apple turnover almond croissants and cheese danishturnoverthingy  i even bought my mom a thanksgiving cupcake with plastic turkey on top  old school    my only criticism is i wish they had a true vegetarian sandwich on their lunch menu","4966":"went with friends from out of state that had not been at a greek restaurant food and service was good food came out fast bakery right there too was awesome and we purchased some things to take home gyros were huge and other dishes had large portions no lunch menu so felt the portions were a bit large for lunch i have had better gyros and sauce in flavor but none that big the pita bread was very good","4968":"great bar  their hot wings are among the best in the area  i would go there just for the wings  the only problem is that you can still smoke in there but that is a good point for some people  beer selection is decent and their service is really good  i tend to rate bars like this based on comfort level  bucket feels like home","4969":"tried this place for the first time today got the 5 alarm pizza for us a personal cheese for our picky daughter and a free side of superstix for checking in on yelp sat down at a table and realized that happy hour was going on and we could have gotten a smaller cheese pizza for a cheaper price  food was pretty great our pizza was loaded with toppings staff would check up on us periodically to see if we needed anything and how the food was  my only real complaint i have  and i have with all restaurants really is that the child seats felt and looked gross","4971":"we found the place on yelp and thought to try it with my family   there were 6 of us that arrived at about 530pm on a monday and it was not busy  we ordered several dishes like the egg plant snow pea scallion pancakes chicken nuggets and more  the food was authentic like home made which was tasty indeed   yes i would recommend to friends","4973":"what can i say about pancake pantry other then to say they are amazing the service was excellent and i was lucky to get there at a time when i could literally walk right in without a wait  the pancakes were smaller then i expected so i ended up ordering a bit more food it was late in the day and i hadnt eaten a thing everything was delicious","4975":"pretty good and cheap my fave place to get boba here  if only they sold snacks","4978":"this brewery is awesome for a good quick bite but also for their amazing beer its a great young professional and also college age vibe in the restaurant itself","4983":"this place is at the very end of stearns wharf  its not very big and it takes awhile to get a table however the guys that work there are very efficient and take good care once youre seated clam chowderpretty good lobster roll  again pretty good dungeness crab also good overall its a good seafood restaurant with nice pacific ocean views ","4985":"the food was great however despite having a reservation we had to wait for quite a while to get a table and be served we barely had enough time to get to our concert the place was quite noisy too and i think it may have been louder than the concert i would go again on a less busy night","4986":"far superior taste to cafe du monde the service sucks and sometimes you cant even get in the door but the beignets and hot chocolate are worth it it was a great stop after dances as well as many nights hitting the bars in fat city now its a sweet family outing and its always nice to stop in to the newspaper stand next door","4988":"ill tell you whati read up about bailys range before giving it a try and i was still blown away about how cool it was nobody really talks much about the enormous amount of flavored bottled sodas you can try we tried a green river lime soda and a reeds spiced apple soda  fantastic lots of mention about the shakes but not much was said about the homemade ice cream desserts that they have i was expecting the typical burger bar and got so much more  the atmosphere is super cool two stories with the longest communal table you ever will see and a bar upstairs has traditional seating that overlooks downstairs and also has bartype seating around the perimeter of the windows the kitchen is exposed on the first level separated from the dining room with various gigantic window panes  we started with the smoked onion rings  some of the best ive ever had  with rooster sauce awesome mix of stone grain mustard and mayo for dinner i went with one of the burger war beef burgers  espresso rubbed topped with blue cheese caramelized onions bacon and apple slivers it was awesome the flavors totally worked and it was obvious the ingredients were all high quality we split fries with their cheese sauce  fries were great and the cheese sauce was good but not your typical  it was very light in color and had hints of white wine pretty good but not as good as the rooster sauce for dessert we split scoops of pistachio and salted caramel ice cream we made it a sundae chocolate whipped cream and nuts for 2 more  the premium mixed nuts on top made the up charge more than worth it  service was topnotch very helpful answered every question knowledgeably was around enough but not too much  the only complaint and the only thing from keeping this a 5star review is the fact that they serve the burgers on cold buns it got to the point where i started eating my burger with a fork to work around the bun it looks like they bake them on site so im not sure why they wouldnt take the extra step to toast them before they serve you they do have an option of a pretzel roll for 1 more so maybe ill try that next timebecause ill definitely be back","4993":"visiting from out of town decided to give it a try pizza and garlic knots were pretty good we would eat it again","4998":"my wife and i had dinner at maynards on nye and were really impressed while the service was a bit slow the food more than made up for it and although the dish we had cassolette was a bit strangeit was basically a big bowl of meat duck leg and sausage on a bed of pulled pork and beansthe individual ingredients were amazing the housemade sausage provided several enjoyable burps throughout the evening overall a great experience at a wonderful tucson gem","4999":"revisited the depot for a 5th time last night the place was packed but we had a reservation so no worries once we were seated it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come over and take our drink order this was after my husband went to the hostess stand to request a server i was afraid the whole night was going to go that way but luckily i was wrong  the food was excellent as usual the menu had something for everyone in our group from the vegetarian to the meat eater food came out in a timely manner hot and delicious  the building is gorgeous i highly recommend a reservation on weekend nights","5002":"although the name is supercorny its very fitting  they do indeed sell more than just ice cream  ive been here a bunch of times now for sitdown lunch and really enjoy it the front is just a counter but the sitdown part is in the back  very small casual laidback dining area but nice  the servers are always really friendly  the place always smells fabulous obviously  id say the prices are generally reasonable  most of their food has a homemade taste to it  their hummus is very yummy and i always get a grilled cheese sandwich which sounds simple right  oh no my friend  the bread they use which i think is honeywheat is simply out of this world  maybe its just me but that theres a tastey sangwich  ok now about those desserts obviously the ice cream is yummy  duh  their apple pie looks horrific but from what ive heard its amazingly good  the main thing to know is that their portion sizes border on obnoxious  so either bring a friend and share or make a dessert your main entree  cause aint nobody gon eat dat much  its kind of annoying too because its not like you can take it home with you well i guess you could but wouldnt it get all runny and melty and gross  my fave is the brownie sundae  good god yall   two complaints 1  i noticed that the food not the dessert food just the foody food tends to take forever to come out  i know its because everything is made to order and cooked right there in front of you in the kitchen which is nice and all but if youre in a bit of a hurry as i am when im on my lunch break you may get held up and a little annoyed  2 horrible music on the speakers  last time we went it was a bunch of cher technoremixes and the time before that en entire cd of jennifer lopez  not that its blasting or anything but still annoying  those two complaints may just be coincidental things that only seem to happen when im there","5003":"found this quaint diner looking brother breakfast  i had the cinnamon swirls french toast and it was delicious  my waitress inga was awesome   this place is worth a return trip","5007":"solid brewery and a nice casual spot to drink a couple  view of the production floor through a glass wall behind the bar  friendly bartenders and the food looked pretty good too  definitely worth a stop on the st louis brewery circuit","5014":"i was flabbergasted when i stepped into the midtown wine  spirits for the first time how is it possible that ive lived in music city for four years and never have stepped foot inside this haven of boozery   maybe i dont like to get down like others in the group but it would take me two lifetimes to taste every antiprohibition ale in the joint if i wasnt going there for a specific item collier and mckeel whiskey im not sure what i would have done except for wonder while i wander around like a deer in headlights for a solid three hours  compliments are due for the layout and the little bottles of liquor at the register very similar to the candy sitting within arms reach at walgreens or cvs for those lastminute impulse purchases handy handy handy    fortunately the staff were interested in leading me to the buried treasure and my husband loved it for those liquor lovers in your life purchase their next big birthday present from midtown youll gain two friends for life","5015":"never give up the chance to eat beignets beignets are french donuts topped with powdered sugar if youre like me  and never want to share deliciois food esp beignets and dont want evidence showing you have been there because when theres good food we are a little selfish dont lie i know im not the only one dont wear black the powdered sugar gets every where lolol  they have a drive through here for quick pick ups if you dont want to stop inside to eatdrink if you do plan on ordering to go it would be a good idea to ask for the beignets and powdered sugar be put in different bags so it doesnt all melt together by the time you are ready to eat them   theyre so hot fluffy doughy goodness everytime im in town i will always have to make a stop to pick some up they have souvenir stuff inside that you can pick up including a premix that you can buy to make some yourself at home   only reason im giving a four instead of a 5 is because of their restroom situation they really really are in need of a major restroom make over  its old disgusting cramped and stinks do not use the restroom it will make you lose your appetite","5017":"best dessert bakery in northern nevada havent been there for a dinein meal yet but cookies and pastries are awesome breads are ok  not much selection","5018":"okay first time here and i really was great every bite i took i was happy with the wait wasnt too bad prices were good although i found it a little strange they charge for a cup of water really the woman who too my order was nice and had a big smile always a plus the only reason they didnt get a straight 5 star was the dining experience there just is not enough space in there i was elbow to elbow with people i didnt know and it was pretty loud they need a bigger location they really are doing fried chicken right  i was overall really happy i wont be returning to popeyes for the rest of my stay in nola thats for sure this place had a great homecookin flavor","5020":"this store is the best thing to happen to the brewerytown neighborhood in a long time gone are my mile walks to score a lemon or other last minute needed ingredient i have been to bottom dollar 3 times since they opened and i am very pleased with the selection although i do most of my shopping via csa membership i still need staples from time to time and this store makes it possible to walk and get them   the produce seems to be just as nice as at fresh grocer and they have plenty of name brands along with their store brand it is slightly smaller than a typical suburban grocery store but they seem to have all the basics and even an aisle of pharmacy and pet goods their staff is friendly and the store is clean there is also plenty of parking in the lot should want to make a trip that requires a car   be prepared when you shop to use a quarter to rent the shopping cart something i have never experienced but rebecca s told me aldi stores do the same thing and have your reusable shopping bags these procedures are in place to keep costs down which i appreciate","5023":"great food  great service great view  only bad thing is those pesky bums harassing you on the way in for spare change if they were all relocated to middle of ocean this place would be heaven","5025":"i was here on a saturday night and probably the oldest person in here i had a salad which was really good i also did a flight of beers and a flight of hard liquor i had 2 bourbons and the 2 ryes all the alcohol was quite good i sat at the bar so my service was great i cant speak about table service the one thing about the place is it is really loud seemed like a lot of locals were in here but its definitely got the trendy hipster thing going id definitely go back when im in town again","5026":"chilled asparagus soup with whiskey and sage bread was superb i loved the individual loaf of bread  it looked charming easy place to be on your own but not feel marooned","5028":"been to broadripple brew pub many times this place is always packed there is usually a wait but its totally worth it its a traditional irish pub with a twist they have many typical irish dishes but also have pizza and other options as well you have to try the scottish eggs they are probably the best ive ever had   prices are reasonable atmosphere is great service is usually pretty good we had an issue with our server the last time we were there she obviously did not want to be there other than that its typically been a great experience","5029":"lines of people cuz its goodreasonable pricessandwichesdinner to go eat in tables availablesmall grocery for delectable gourmet items","5030":"if youre looking for naturalorganic items you dont mind trying the store brand and youre a salesshopper andor a coupon clipper genuardis is a good place for you skip whole foods and go another block down to genuardis qualitys good prices can be excellent if you shop on sale andor with a coupon use the flyer it has good deals most of the time  if youre super pregnant and ready to pop or you have a squirmy baby to bring with you genuardis offers a stork parking spot i remember these being much more common back in the days when my older female relatives were pregnanthaving babies but for my generation its a rare find and i like that genuardis has it  the readymade food is good especially the sushi theres a deal where you can get a free sandwich if you use your clubcard whenever you buy sandwiches there my husband and i became big fans of their readymade fresh soups when we were sick this past winter  the staff is quite friendly and helpful especially for a large chain supermarket on the main line  the produce here is definitely fresher than at superfresh and lately trader joes and prices are a little better they also always have more cashier lanes open than the other stores in the area so it takes less time to checkout if thats important to you  the selection is good and its pretty wellstocked i dont have to get rain checks here as often as i do at superfresh im primarily a sales shopper  the only downside is that ive come to rely on this location for my occasional movie rental from the blockbuster express kiosk  and the past two times that ive gone its been a bust one time it was out of order and last time it was just missing  disappeared  hope thats helpful","5033":"il posto is simply ill in a good way  like how wicked is cool anyway i havent had a lot of stuff here but the pressed sandwiches are pretty amazing theyre large in portion and also very tasty they come with a side salad so youre definitely getting bang for your buck i love the caprese the prosciutto is also very good but a tad bit salty i guess proscuitto is always a bit salty though the vibe is very quaint and cute i just wish it was closer to me so i could become a regular on second thought i dont want to have to buy a new wardrobe","5034":"i tried all of the flavors and found them to be too sweet the exception was lemon which was perfect for a hot summer day","5038":"completely agree with lauren s comments terrific staff and a very clean well organized establishment  the setup and the taste are great tried and true","5040":"our tacos were delicious we will definitely come back the building itself was a little lacking a bit of a dive set back in a strip mall the prices were great so was the service for a taco shop they are on point  thanks guys","5044":"loved every food item we ordered the cioppino was just right spicy and the sweetbreads appetizer was surprisingly crisp and flavorful pork belly tacos were a big hit the food is creatively prepared and the ingredients are all fresh  the servers were all delightful people but the fooddrinksseating were uneven left us thinking they have some kinks to work out  the building is as great as everyone says","5045":"for my recent trip to st louis ted drewes was on my list of places to stop by even though it was freezing outside without a bit of sunshine my friends and i originally went to the other location because it was closer to where we were but to our disappointment the other location was closed and it told us to go to this location which was about a 1015 minute drive depending on traffic we got there and saw that ted drewes is a historic tourist spot to visit on route 66 so we knew we were in for a real treat  the menu can be overwhelming especially since i wanted to try everything with the help of the lady taking my order i narrowed down my choices and ordered the fox treat and it was amazing i really enjoyed the fresh fruits in my sundae but i think i wouldnt get the fudge next time because it became a bit too sweet towards the end  my friends and i ran into a local as we were leaving and she said that this place is amazing and she has been going here once a month for as long as she can remember this place is definitely a must see if you are visiting stl","5046":"since i work downtown ive been staring at the nice signage all summer waiting to see what was going to go in the spot that had been city grocery  when i had finally read about the plans for this place i was instantly excited  each passing day walking past and seeing the brown paper that had once shuddered the windows reveal what i could only hope was another awesome restaurant experience in downtown    i could hardly wait for lunch on friday as i and several other coworkers embarked down olive to have lunch at this new establishment we were promptly greeted and seated since we were veterans of the downtown lunch scene go early or dont go is the motto and looked over our choices we were seated at the long table which is a new dining experience in itself since other parties can be and were seated directly next to hours  this didnt bother me one bit but some of my coworkers were a little take aback by it and wanted to have some more space  i ended up going with just the basic burger although the daves smoked burger and the black and blue sounded amazing i thought it best to just go with the basic for now  i added the house cheddar sauce and a small order of fries with the house mayo    looking over the menu there are a wide variety of toppingsadditions and sauces that you can pair with any of the burgers which means you never have to try the same combination twice  also there is an expansive soda fountainesque menu for different types of soda or pop as it is called in some areas along with numerous different shakemalt concoctions that can be served with or without booze in them  these drink menus made me think if crown candy and the chocolate bar ever got together for a one night stand this restaurant would be the result of that encounter   the service was a bit on the slow side and i will chalk that up to the system used the sheer number of people who walked in after us and seating arrangement used in the place while the decorative old windows that are suspended around the cooking and prep areas are very cool to look at i dont think it will be long before they are replaced with something less transparent    back to the food my burger had arrived and it was cooked to temperature medium expertly  the only thing i could fault with it was that the house cheese sauce is actually a sauce and not very thick so it had rolled off the burger and onto the plate  i could barely taste it but the burger itself was flavorful  the fries were great as well and i did enjoy the mayo that accompanied it on the side  the chipolte mayo got the most rave reviews from the table though so it is something ill have to try next time  we all agreed at the end of our meal that we werent overly stuffed or full but satisfied which was a nice feeling to have rather than feel bloated or miserable  i think that is the feeling that will bring me back to this place in the future","5048":"we went here to eat well i was a little disappointed we had to order so much good all portions were small we ordered the meat and cheese to start then we had pasta dishes and we were still starving we ordered two pizzas i know what your all thinking but everything was so small the waitress was very nice and the service was strange because it was always someone new coming over to us  the place overall is clean check out the bathroom in the basement","5054":"they seem to fix my concerns clean and welcoming cafe they have a stool and table that i use as a standing table helps my posture the cafe isnt freezing cold like other cafes free refills on regular coffee and iced coffee","5057":"i got the big jerk  kale salad that i saw many rave reviews over and was not disappointed    and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the blt","5059":"this was our first visit to this new restaurant we went on a monday night which we knew would pretty slow the hostess was not very friendly and when she seated us in the bar we thought it was not going to be good  however our waiter was very nice and took good care of us without hovering my husband did not care for the new england clam chowder it had weird little strips of clams and too many potatoes his seafood salad was very good as was my grilled salmon all in all it was a good experience and we will go back","5061":"dishes sampled included kanella platter with stuffed grape leaves tabouli falafel fried eggplant spicy tomato salad tzanziki olives and pita  malohwa pan fried savory puff pastry from yemen boiled egg spicy tomato salad and greek yogurt  cyprus crepe  crepe stuffed with manouri cheese drizzled with carob syrup  mousaka  ground lamb layered with grilled eggplant and topped with b\u00e9chamel  chefs mothers coconut date and hazelnut cake  with date and orange syrup  baklava  fillo pastry filled with walnuts and pistachios soaked in spiced syrup  galatopoureko  fillo pastry filled with semolina custard drizzled with orange syrup  the second of two breakfasts that day my visit to kanella featured two of my favorite dining companions and ordering widely from the interesting greek inspired menu i think we all walked away quite impressed by not only the quality of the food but also of the service a small family run operation where everyone was more than happy to tell you about the recipes and heritage of each dish  not well versed in greek food and actually not at all a fan of grape leaves or tzanziki the beauty of this menu for me was the more esoteric options such as the savory puff pastry and the sweets  the crepe and the galatopoureko particularly excellent id definitely revisit for breakfast or dinner particularly given the wonderful family atmosphere and bargain prices for food i generally do not go out of my way for  an experience both delicious and educational","5062":"spoon me is my favorite froyo spot out of all the local chains  berry creamy in deptford and the yogo factory in somerdale dont compare  it is located next to pancheros so i usually am there for a main meal and follow it with spoon me for dessert its in a good area near other stores and shopping areas in voorhees  it has a small seating area inside to the right when you walk in along with an uncomfortable metal table directly next to the door outside for alfresco seating  the yogurt flavors vary daily but only a few the most popular ones that are always present are irish mint vanilla chocolate yellow cake batter but ive also seen red velvet cake cinnamon roll cheesecake and more they also have sorbet that is very fruity and tasty when ive tried it i believe it is 49 cents an ounce like all of froyo places seem to be  they also do smoothies and drinks made from yogurt they offer belgian waffles topped with froyo they have oatmeal in the morning  the topping bar is always very neat and the pieces are cut to the perfect bite size and shape there are sprinkles chocolate chips candies cereal like cinnamon toast crunch sauces like marshmallow peanut butter white and dark chocolate and hot fudge there are fruit and those asian pearls for drinks and there are brownies and cheesecake bites as well i love the brownie bites  the decor is also not alarming or ugly like the yogo factory in somerdale its contemporary playful and tasteful mellow colors futuristic chairs  they have punch cards where they offer the tenth or so yogurt free  the staff usually high school kids who are friendly enough im in my early twenties and cant stand annoying kids which happens to be the majority of their clientele dont go on friday or saturday night because the place is overrun with preteens on their iphones and in their ugly uggs i usually go during the day on week days to avoid this  overall good froyo and annoying crowd","5064":"i judge every produce stand by their strawberries and the strawberries i got from  phillips were the juiciest most flavorful berries ive had in a long time i could sing songs about those beautiful berries   everything else was ok","5065":"guac and chips are fab  i seriously dont know how to handle one of those big a burritos so i got a bowl wrice and the chicken was excellentreal chargrilled chicken not the psuedo chicken crap that thell passes off as chicken  the only reason its not five stars is the seatingatompshere sucks metal tables and noise level was horrific like school cafeteria days","5069":"great service its obvious that great care has gone into crafting the menu items our corn bisque and sonoran gyro dinner was excellent","5070":"the iced coffee is delicious and only 2 you can get la colombe coffee all over philly but i like going here because the staff is so incredibly friendly its a nice way to start the day","5071":"if you hate american coffee especially starbucks but shy away from gutscortching italian espresso this place is for you  if i lived in philly this place alone would convert me back to being a coffee drinker  its kind of like getting hooked on motrin 800s   giving them up because you just were feeling it any more and then having someone walk in and hand you a percocet 10350  i hurt myself a lot  that was the best analogy i could come up with","5072":"this place needs a missed connection category on the website the sheer amount of gorgeous individuals checking each other out is ridiculous you cant stand in line without making eye contact with someone beautiful it may be the hang out for university hipsters but there are also a lot of rugged beautiful guys there with or without stylish lady friendsclearly something for everyone the cashiers tend to seem a little frazzled hung over and unbathed but whatever i like the coffee and the atmosphere on a sunday is superdelux if you dont mind the diy cafe experience where you might have to steal chairs from another table or linger in line a little longer waiting for numbnuts in front of you to figure out what a chai is than this is the place for you and your buds five hour movie patience is required plus its worth using the please clean the bathroom more often washrooms because there are crass novellas written all over the walls nice touch","5074":"i toured the brewery with a small group and the brewers passion for their craft really shined through  the brewery front is like one big room of reclaimed but behind the scenes the brewing ops are all sleek and modern  a perfect mix  on a saturday afternoon the place was pretty busy  the bar was serving beer like a lunch counter  plan your trip with this in mind but otherwise enjoy","5079":"i love this place best hot dogs in tucson sadly i dont go anymore because i dont ever carry cash with me and from time to time they accept credit cards but last time i was there they had to turn my business down because i had no cash","5080":"first time here nice and quaint   very relaxed and easy going in here   coffee is pretty good and live the ambiance","5081":"we love this place  the food is great portion sizes are ample and easily shareable if you dont want to overspendovereat  top if off with their pastry and mimosas and youve got a great breakfast joint  you can expect to wait for at least 20 minutes on most weekends however and there isnt a lot of room to do that inside the restaurant  that said this place is worth the wait","5084":"i love this place both their hamburgers and hot dogs are amazing the cheese not so much too thick and plastic like im also not crazy about the fries but that is personal taste not anything to do with the restaurant i like a crispier fry i do love the cajun seasoning though very tasty  staff are all your typical teenager type workers and the service has always been very good i absolutely love the complimentary peanuts i think its a fun and tasty way to pass the time not that the wait is long either til you get your yummy food","5085":"in so far as mcdonalds goes this is the best well run clean efficient given the inherent disadvantages of staffing the food is the food the manager works tirelessly to ensure that the standards are high go jennifer","5087":"this place has some good breakfast burritos theyre huge and i recommend getting salsa and sour cream to go with them","5089":"what can i say i only did the drive through and felt like a family member i got a cuppa cuppa coffee with hot chocolate french vanilla  whipped cream yummy  they brought me an assortment of various danishes muffins  assorted goodies that i just could not resist i took a coco late chip breakfast bar  this was more than plenty for breakfast  it was filling fresh  very tasty most protien or healthy breakfast bars taste like sawdust not this one it was very moist and the flavor was very satisfying  will i be back you bet i gotta try the tea  of course a smoothie whats  a  girl  to  do  keep looking  you will find all you want  need","5090":"i love this store awesome options for ready to go meals their take and bake pizzas are really good i love the atmosphere of this place only drawback its a little pricey","5092":"always fun and delicious theres an open face pesto chicken  sandwich  that is simply  divine  i do wish there were more vegetarian friendly offerings","5093":"i eat here at least once and week and love their food and staff  its a cozy place to meet friends and has a great varity of items to chose from  best soups in town","5094":"one of my fav mexican spots in town very delicious and great pricing the quesadilla a la diablo is a must try with rice yummmm","5095":"this place isnt your normal burger joint these guys do it right they feed you while you eat with free peanuts in a shell never mind that counting calories crap you know how you fix that order the lil burger and load it with the veggies like grilled onions peppers lettuce and tomato all at no extra cost they always give you an extra healthy portion of fries  cooked in peanut oil and the fact that they take the time to hang all those little kids drawing up on theyre corkboard lt you know they appreciate you mr or mrs consumer","5098":"i stopped by once and got a good snapshot  the service is excellent  your food is served fast  they frequently check on you to see how things are going  the food is good  the grilled cheese sandwich is excellent  the fries are kind of average and the portion is small  everything on the menu is way overpriced  overall i give 4 stars assuming everyone is a high roller with a lot of extra bucks to spend","5102":"all right pigbunny  time to level with you  time for some harsh truth and honesty and tough love  pigbunny  can i call you pigbunny  because my wife and i do all the time  you are our neighborhood pub and restaurant  you are warm and inviting  you have many fine alcohols for us to consume  your fries are superb  we want to come to you all the time  at least all the times when youre not teeming with douchebags  weve learned your rhythms and know when the douche rolls in  in short we want to give you all our money  but we cant because you dont offer any vegetarian dinner entrees  dont even start by saying you have a cheese plate or welsh rarebit or a salad  those arent entrees  those are sides and apps  i find it impossible to believe you cant make a vegetarian entree  i find it impossible because youve done it before a pasta dish a sandwich  something  something good and tasty  you have good food  surely you can create something  i might get that vegetarian entrees arent bigticket items but youre turning away dollars  bar dollars especially  sure youre not making a lot on that spring vegetable gnocchi but the wine and beer we consume would surely compensate for that  more to the point though fries and a cheese plate arent a meal  youre basically saying that vegetarians just shouldnt bother  so we dont except for brunch when my wife can have the cheese omelet  when i first reviewed you i gave you five stars because you were that awesome and accommodating  in fact that is part of the reason we love you so much  when we first moved to philly we were tired and stressed after a long day of hauling boxes and beth made us feel like we really had found a home  and now  less welcoming  so youre docked a star  i hope to give it back to you very very soon","5103":"meaning of the only problem here is that their french fries are soggy and undercooked","5105":"4 hands was probably the best microbrewery i had visited on my trip to st louis it was tucked away in an industrial area close to downtown st louis which was interesting but most of these micro breweries these days are in some sort of industrial area of town  it had more of an intimate vibe and the beers were great i went on a friday afternoon so it wasnt too busy  they had 8 of their own beers on tap and they allowed you to grab a flight of 4 beers for 8 dollars which was pretty reasonable judging by the 5 oz pours unlike some places they actually allow you to choose your flight of beers which is nice no one likes to be forced into beers they have no interest in trying luckily i wanted to try them all so i got 2 flights of all their beers my favorites were the milk chocolate stout and their single speed session ale  i didnt eat anything off the menu because our trip to 4 hands was preceded with a trip to pappys smokehouse but their menu looked packed with bar food from nachos to wings to pizza it was way fuller than a lot of the micro breweries i went to on my trip   i definitely recommend anyone to stop here if they are interested in the craft beer scene","5107":"good food over the top atmosphere our waiter was great but on the two trips that i took two of my sons to the restroom i noticed a recurring theme the staff is not in a hurry to get out of your way in fact you have to move out of their way no food in hand just walking  normally restaurant staff moves over after all you are their guest the food is good but the prices are high and the surrounding restaurant are cheaper and presumably of equal quality the bakery really got me i purchased four saragli two koulourakia two kourabiedes two bakalava and a small tsoureki for a grand total of 26 i would go back but only after trying the other surrounding restaurants in no way do i want to give a bad review it was good i would like to try other restaurants especially when theyre cheaper","5109":"this was my first visit and it was a fast one just about an hour but it was long enough to clearly see this place is off to a very good start its surprisingly spacious inside and is very open bright and cheery there also is a large outdoor bar and seating area and looks perfect for lunch or dinner or hanging out for hours with your friends   we only had time for two beers and an appetizer but it was enough to view the menu loaded with goodies from standards to some with a twist  our smoked amberjack dip and chips tasted fresh not fishy and was flavorful the beer selection had plenty to choose from and our two selections were right on target  our server and her trainee were personable knew the menu were efficient and not pushy without a doubt well be back to check out the full deal and report our findings","5116":"the beignets are fantastic and the wait was virtually nonexistent i highly recommend venturing here instead of wasting time in line for the slightly more popular places in the french quarter i also had the crawfish bread which was not so good the crawfish and cheese on top made the bread very soggy","5120":"i stopped in here for lunch even though the reviews were less than stellar i mainly came in because i had been craving fried seafood and this place had what i needed  it was later in the day so the restaurant was pretty empty and i was seated immediately i decided to start with a bowl of the corn and crab bisque the bisque wasnt anything overly special but it was pretty good and i enjoyed it i also got the des allemands catfish which was one of the lunch specials of the day this was great a generous serving of tender catfish that was lightly battered and very tasty was presented with diced potatoes and green beans the fish wasnt over cooked at all and the potatoes and green beans were a good addition to the meal  service was good and the food came out quickly probably because there werent a lot of people here i would say this is a good place for lunch but the atmosphere feels a little cold for dinner","5121":"i bought a deal chicken coupon because i loved the kirkwood location and my intention was going thereuntil i went to make a reservation and found out it was closed what a terrible disappointment to my surprise the restaurant on clayton though a bit farther to drive to is a bit on the dressier side we were asked wether we wanted to be seated in the dining room or the courtyard my friend and i were dressed business casual so we chose the courtyard making us feel less out of place and much more comfortable the menu on the website still has my absolute favorite appetizer listed the smoked trout with garlic lemon aioliand it is not on the menu there again i was disappointed hint to restaurant please update your website but fear not fans of the kirkwood location the food and service is still up to the best standards and the rest of the meal was not a disappointment my friend and i shared the carpaccio appetizer which was very good we both had excellent entrees and were much too full for dessert i would definitely pay full price for a meal here on a special occasion and the staff were excellent and deserved the good tip that we left","5123":"went to brunch at this charming restaurant this past weekend the service was a bit slow but still attentive and the food was delicious i had the smoked salmon on toast with a side of roasted potatoes   the coffee was fresh and the restroom was clean which is always a nice touch be certain to check out the photos on the walls as theyre a taste of old hollywood glamour my friends mentioned that many of the celebrities who live in montecito love to eat here as well","5125":"this was my first visit to tarpon springs if youre expecting a ton of greek restaurants touristy shops full of sponges of all shapes sizes and qualities and every variation of gator and florida tchotchke tarpon springs is a perfect stop for all of that between the incessant heat if youre going in the summer and dock boat tour stands is a lovely little restaurant called hellas   youll find all the traditional greek dishes here including the gyro souvlaki pita and all the other heart burn inducing and totally worth it temptations   our waiter seemed a little on the tired sideor maybe the disgusting heat zapped all the opa out of him totally understandable   i picked the chicken souvlaki with a side of fries it was yummy and the chicken was white meat cooked to perfectioncooked well but not too hard and still juicy my mom got the blt and didnt realized it came in a pita bread i think she just wanted a traditional blt not a bltp lol the sis got the regular gyro and really enjoyed it the hubs got the pastitsio or what he called a greek lasagnahe liked it  for appetizers we got the flamed cheese dish saganaki the guy bought it out lit it on fire said opa and then we ate the heck of it it was a pretty small cut of cheese i was definitely hoping for something biggeri mean they said opa that deserves a big wedge of cheese for us to destroy we also got the feta cheese spread with sides of pita i ended up dipping most of my fries in the feta cheese spreadsthat was yummy  after this we were too stuffed for dessert but if youre a savage glutton you can get a ton of great things here or go take a walk so you can come back and stuff yourself again at their bakery next door 1010 would stuff our faces again also there are pokemon go stops just outside so theres that","5133":"the instant smell of sweetness gives you no choice but to buy something  the pralines are pretty good  im a fan moreso of the white chocolate and chocolate peanut butter cups  if youre looking for cute souveniors for kids they have cute chocoloate alligators and crawfish  cute store great location  the people there are always cordial also which helps alot","5134":"got the rizzo and it was awesome cooked perfectly also got the drunken fries a must staff was super friendly and was having a great time 1010 would spot burger again","5135":"great place for a quick fix when im craving pho not the best ive ever had but it still hits the spot large portions with a low price service is very nice and timely convenient location in the fred meyer complex is perfect for quick dinner and shopping nights on my way home  havent tried the sandwiches yet but i plan on it and will update then","5136":"this place is really good we had a breakfast bagel ham egg and cheese all of it was fresh","5138":"best bagel ive had in the area i had a toasted blueberry bagel with egg white and turkey the bagel was great crunchy on the outside and super soft and fluffy on the inside  the staff is incredibly friendly at olivias the woman behind the counter was patient when i couldnt figure out what i wanted an accommodating when i started mixing and matching things on the menu i know im a pain in the ass i was the only person in the place that she did not know by first name   a really great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch  oh and they have sriracha which is awesome","5139":"sunday brunch the service was good although our waitress seemed a bit nervous and uncertain the food was good and really interesting  this is not your typical anglo brunch menu this was the most interesting meal ive had in a long time id love to try them for dinner but right now dinner prices are out of my range  so id recommend them for a very reasonable and interesting brunch experience","5141":"so i finally made it over for there infamous burger when i ordered and they didnt  ask me how i wanted it cooked i was concerned but i was pleasantly surprised the 2patties were very tasty the lettuce tasted like juicy coleslaw there was definitely a distinct flavor to this burger the bunn was a bit too dense  the fries were frustrating they kept braking off in to my ketchup because they were so skinny 25min wait was rough but i left satisfied","5144":"batch cupcakery has vegan and gluten free cupcakes as well as a huge selection of regular cupcakes and cookies stopped in earlier and picked up two vegan chai cupcakes to go and they were delicious the frosting is the best part of these cupcakes as it is not overly sweet and perfectly compliments the cupcake we had stopped coming into batch because sometimes the cupcakes were a bit on the older side but today we hit the jack pot and got super fresh super yummy vegan chai cupcakes so good","5146":"who doesnt like costco i really need to plan or at least know what to get when im at costco coz if not i will just be randomly getting anything because pretty much they have everything i like their seafood  fruit aisle we usually get our lobster crab shrimp here  most of our fruits also they have their own brand kirkland so with paper towel  toilet paper its my go to and oh did i say rice i think they have cheap rice compared to asian store so we get ours here they have monthly sales or a coupon book that i always check so i can buy some stuff that i dont normally get or just to stock up cheapest gas too","5148":"an cajun restaurant with local flavors warm decor and friendly service by the harrahs hotel on the edge of the french quarter we were here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by their reasonable pricing and fresh ingredients the oysters were great as were the beignets i didnt try the gamba but my friend loved it   i tried the crawfish which was good but too salty everything was way too salty in my plate including the corn salt was allowed sadly to take over everything the amount of salt attacked my palettes rather than enliven them   the whole dish was spicy which was fine it was the saltiness thats a problem   service was efficient and very friendly which is a redeeming point a beautiful restaurant with just the right noise level","5149":"if u like a bohemian atmosphere youll love this place  i usually have the ninja bomb  a turkey wrap w cranberry salsa and granola for texture","5153":"while im not a huge fan of their layered cakes very dry with meh buttercream that falls off your fork as you try to eat it i must say that their cannoli are omgsoamazing think creamysmooth ricotta filling inside a perfect crunchy shell if you want to have great cannoli terminis is your place  do not waste your time or calorie intake anywhere else   this place is out of the way of my daily activities but you can count on seeing me trek all the way there just to get cannoli when cravings do come up   sorry i havent managed to photograph any of the cannoli i got from here since they vanish long before i have time to think of doing anything other than eating them","5155":"a mustdo if youre passing through st louis  catch the free shuttle from ballpark village or a 10 uber should get you there from downtown  theres an almost grand entrance when you walk through the sliding doors and you may be hit with sensory overload  tons of interesting history and information on the founding of the brewery and the chronology leading up to current day  insanely cold beers in their tap room and even though im not a huge bud fan theyve got their inbev partner beers which give you some options  about 20 beers on tap and frosty cold  the free tour was great and youll get to see a lot of the brewing process and even the iconic clydesdales  try to avoid this on a hot summer day because youll be outside for half of the tour and its borderline miserable","5156":"i used to corner up to the espresso bar every friday in high school to watch my barista friends at mazzaros make their latte art i dont drink coffee but i definitely eat cookies from the counter directly next to the bar as my buddies fashioned dogs the eifel tower and smiley faces from froth my other favorite things to do at this caf\u00e9market place are look at the giant wheels of chesses stare at the giant stuffed animal heads that move eat meatball subs on the patio next to the bubbling fountain sip on italian soda buy authentic italian goods to fashion into gift baskets buy meatloaf for dinnerand of course eat a lot of cookies","5157":"coffeebar opened with a limited menu so this review is probably premature but i liked what i saw when i stopped by today and i feel comfortable writing about what i saw its a coffee house and i wasnt able to try the coffee the only decaf they have is espresso and that would mean an americano which i hate so i got a hot chocolate instead i also got a ham and cheese croissant and a chocolatepeanutmarshmallow dessert bar i liked everything the hot chocolate was chocolaty and they put a generous mound of whipped cream on top the dessert bar  ive already forgotten the specific name  was decadently good loaded with calories and flavor its worth a trip there for that i liked the croissant and i would get it again it seemed a little old though im not sure when they cooked it and i would have liked a little more prosciutto service was friendly the layout was different than the former bibo location there they have expanded to the back of the building along the outer wall and theyve given up some of the former bibo space i guess the pizza place next door might expand into that the grand opening with the full menu i guess is about a week away when i can sample their coffee i think ill be able to do my best review but i like what i see so far","5158":"very americanized sushi rolls are massive and include ingredients like mayo okra corn etc  sushi snobs stay away although the quality of fish is high and i have to admit it is tasty in a cheap american way  fun atmosphere techno music trendy","5159":"the sweet cream ice cream is divine add chopped up butterfingers to a like it size and serve it in a waffle bowl the chocolate dipped one makes it an extra special treat its worth a nearly 10 mile drive  even without a coupon the staff is always friendly and efficient im hooked","5160":"deciding to come to the vientiane cafe a laotianthai restaurant was a pretty easy choice after hearing a positive review about it from a friend the only difficult part to getting out here would be convincing my other friends that it would be worth the short trek from penns campus always looking to explore affordable options outside of penns standard offerings i finally got a small group to come out to try the place on a slow weekend  the vientiane has a small storefront located along a row of other randomly puttogether offerings including a record store and a chinese takeout restaurant upon entering the restaurant there was a sense of warmth and community as the waiters and kitchen hummed along and the diners happily focused on their food and conversation stepping in from the chilly walk and the proximity of the other tables certainly helped set the mood too  luckily for us we came just in time to snag the last available table promptly after we arrived a small line began to form outside as a side note its probably better to come a bit earlier for dinner because the restaurant only has seating for about 2025 people  the prices for entrees about 812 for most items were inline with what i was expecting and were pretty wellsized we tried to order more laosinfluenced and less commonplace thai dishes we ended up sharing 4 entreeshomemade sausage laab sweet basil with chicken and a pineapple fried riceand stick rice figuratively the glue to this meal as it absorbed the delicious sauce the sticky rice came in these cool little laotian rice baskets which were used for steaming the rice im sure the rice baskets are commonplace but i was really excited to see them note to self must get out more  after the meal we were all quite satiated and satisfied with our meal including the bill which came to roughly 15 per person allinclusive for my first foray into laotian cuisine i was happy with the experience compared to other asian cuisines there was greater use of mint cilantro and spices to bring out the flavor in the meat dishes my favorite was the laab dish a warm minced meat salad served with chilis and mint it is allegedly  also the unofficial national dish of laos im always amused where wikipedia sources their information when there are no footnotes  i would definitely come back for a lunch or dinner with a small group of friends","5161":"i go here for the iced coffee probably the best in town great flavor and smooth also their deli has some delicious food and oven fired pizza their deserts are also amazing i wouldnt ever buy groceries here as they are extremely overpriced and owned by the same company as albertsons and food city so ill go there the staff is always friendly and they have great catering dishes","5163":"this midcity newcomer is really making an impact fast it took me awhile to finally go in but once i did i have returned regularly they advertise as healthy southern comfort food which is exactly what they are from savory but healthy salads sandwiches and soups to fresh takes on classic entrees they deliver as advertised a couple of my favorites are the black bean burger and the turkey meatball sliders its also a great place to get grab and go items if youre in a rush they have a really good selection of premade items displayed from stuffed peppers to sandwiches and salads check it out great lunch spot my only complaint is that sometimes healthy equals a bit dry but what do you expect overall totally worth it","5164":"hasta que por fin logramos disfrutar de este lugar  mi esposa y yo habiamos intentado en otras ocasiones pero siempre estaba cerrado la primera creo  que hubo un problema de electridad y estuvo cerrado por un tiempo y la segunda estaba cerrado despues de la hora del almuerzo nos gusta mucho la comida del caribe mi esposa es de la costa colombiana y el sabor y los platos son muy parecidas  mi esposa ordeno pan con bistec delicioso y yo el sandwich cubano sopa borracho y sopa de frijoles negros nos regalaron un cafecito cubano bien negro como nos gusta pero un poquito pasado de azucar para mi gusto la comida es autentica cubana el servicio muy bueno el dueno excelente persona con charisma aunque el lugar es un poco pequeno  altamente lo recomiendo","5165":"not the best looking restaurant but the food is good  the coconut shrimp is the best ive ever had  perfectly cooked and good coconut flavor  the mango sauce is a perfect accompaniment i had the bronze bucket with lobster clams mussels and shrimp all were good my wife had the already picked lobster and she was happy with the dish  due to the size of the meal we didnt try desserts","5169":"great mexican byob but not the best neighborhood very small so make sure you make reservations try the ceviche appetizer","5170":"they have great greek salads full of olives and everything however i didnt have such great service today the manager claimed i could sub side salad instead of fries but then the cashier today charged me an extra 2 they didnt do that before when i ordered from the manager when i asked the girl at the counter she said it was normal just a bad day i hype next time is better because overall i like this restaurant","5171":"really hip coffee spot  cappuccino was delicious even served up with a fancy foam design and was loaded with caffeine without being huge  i am still buzzing four hours later  cool vibe  many seating options to choose from high top and bar area community table where i sat what looked like comfy chairs and a couch and outdoor seating  i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because wifi was touch and go at the beginning i didnt try any food i didnt see menus handy or written anywhere that i could notice but im sure if i asked they would have showed me and it was a little loud in there  but none of that would deter me from returning because the staff was super friendly and seemed like real coffee aficionados without being snobby  the coffee machine was really cool and it is apparently a very popular shop because the front door was constantly revolving  check it out  i know i will again soon","5174":"this truck with its operator is great for its uniqueness that goes along with the normally great food chicken falafel down sides when he started out around 10 years ago the sandwiches were actually reasonably priced at around 4 now its 9 with a tip jar  still the food is good and the experience is worth it at once another down side is having to overhear the people blabbing away in line","5176":"visiting tampa for a few days this place was recommended by my sister cool vibe great coffee and the gluten free brownie with coffee buttercream was on point  the only reason i didnt give five stars was because although i liked the music selection it was a little too loud making it hard to concentrate on my book which is usually something i do at coffee shops otherwise i really dig it","5178":"first time visiting bandit and the aesthetic in here is amazing i love the wood black and white aesthetic with fresh plants scattered throughout only reason this didnt get 5 stars is because i came in here specifically to do work and this is not the place for that i might have just come during a very busy time where the conversations were competing with the music but the sounds were a little too loud for me to concentrate it did not help that i was having trouble connecting to the wifi  definitely would return to grab a coffee with a friend though the cappuccino was amazing and had a really beautiful design","5181":"i ate at cafe de manila last night with a friend and had an absolutely delightful meal with very good friendly service  for an appetizer we had lumpia  six filipino  oversize egg rolls with three different sauces an excellent item and lots of food   i cant remember the names of our main courses  which in the filipino fashion we shared  they were also large servings and came with double rice   one was a pork cube light stew with bits of potatolike taro and pineapples  delicious  another was a beef stew in a heavy dark gravy along with green beans whole baby okra pods a few jalape\u00f1olooking peppers but much smaller and milder and a couple of other vegetables  its mouthwatering to write about it  most filipino food is great but if you havent tried an item and it sounds weird you may want to avoid it  i understand cafe de manila has a reasonablypriced buffet on sundays so were going to try it out to sample some of the more unusual dishes  two problems  1 it was karaoke night and the one singer did song after song missing all the high notes  this normally wouldnt have bothered me that much but the volume was enormously high on gigantic speakers and im talking about rock concert loud   2 our server didnt speak much english making it hard to get explanations of the dishes  resolutions  1 after repeated efforts to get the volume down  which changed it from eardrumdamaging to just being totally unable to hear each other  we explained that we were going to have to leave without ordering at that point they moved us into a private dining room where we were the only ones and we had a peaceful meal  2 fortunately the menu does a good job of explaining the items even though our very nice server couldnt as it turned out we were quite pleased with our selections  as mentioned ill definitely be going back  this sunday in fact i would rate the food at five stars with the two problems dropping it to four","5183":"been to them twice  fresh and tasting good great friendly service  love the short ribs taco  get a deal and buy 3 at once  track them down","5185":"we sat in the bar area which had a nice casual vibe   service was good and the ribs were delicious","5186":"i want to write a review for the location right off magazine st but maybe this will suffice this is one of my fav breakfast spots the price is right the place is clean and the food is consistently great  i loooove the ham and cheese croissant also enjoy the breakfast bagel french toast and other items ive tried the lunch isnt too shabby either one thing that annoys me a tad is eating something like pancakes or french toast out of the little plastic serving basket bc the paper its served on tears but hey for the price whatever","5187":"delish customer service was outstanding  i had the seafood benefit and it was great almost made the just ale of putting hot sauce on them but it was amazing without it","5188":"i havent tried everything they offer because my family and i cannot get passed the apple pie with caramel and pecan topping i am more of a cake girl and this dessert is something that makes me look away from the cakes time after time the customer service is wonderful no matter how busy they get samples are always available and they are dog friendly with free homemade treats","5189":"what a very comfortable place to have breakfast  i had been wanting to check them out but never had the opportunity walking in theres a birds eye view of various pastries goodies and this day this saturday the bloody mary bar  i settled on the breakfast burrito wpotatoes for my meal and it was soooo good  there arent many places who do a good job with their breakfast burritos in terms of flavor but this place is tops  id have to say this place will be my goto spot for a breakfast burrito  now potatoes being my favorite food i wasnt overly thrilled with them  they could have used about another 2 minutes in the skillet grill  my friend and i felt comfortable here and actually spent several hours hanging out and talking  the servers were friendly and werent bothered by the amount of time we were there  matter of fact we were there so long that happy hour kicked in and i ended up having 2 glasses of 3 house white wine   love it love it","5190":"great bbq big portions for reasonable prices had the 3 meat 2 fixin combo meal and was happy with everything brisket pulled pork stl ribs mac n cheese corn casserole good ambiance and friendly service received a free app for checking in on yelp","5191":"very tasty pizza delivered quickly and hot on a rainy saturday night  very generous with toppings","5192":"ill give it a 35  but i rounded up because it wasnt a bad experience service was good and fast  the burger was good but not great maybe a little bit too salty  i wish it was a little more pink for a mediumrare that i ordered i liked the truffle fries but it was nothing special the hamburger bun is pretty good i thought they have a pretty nice selection of fountain drinks but thats really not that important ha when compared to five guys i would say this is way better and less messy but a little bit more expensive for how small the burger is i would still take a burger from village whiskey any day and pay the extra premium","5193":"really good donuts and pastry best gourmet donuts so give it a try","5194":"the pluses  1it was very easy to get a table even though i only called 45 minutes before we wanted to dine 2 the server was very friendly although she did forget to bring the cream for my tea and she forgot to bring my husbands second drink until reminded 3 the onion soup was very good my husband loved it i thought it was a tad too salty  4 the cassoulet was delicious and was a very generous serving  5  the mushroom side was also very good  the minuses 1 parking is terrible we managed to find a space in the tiny parking lot they do have valet parking  we just didnt notice it until we had already parked and there is a giant parking garage less then a block away 2 pricey but  not outrageous 3 my husband had the fish which he felt was overwhelmed by the toppings rather than enhanced by them 4 the ambience was nice but it does get a bit loud as the restaurant fills up by the end of the meal we could hardly hear each other","5195":"good stuff pretty expensive pretty fattening pretty dang good i like to mix and match flavors","5196":"the food is very good for your basic mexican fare  pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff and good service","5198":"our typical chain mexican restaurant experienced was bumped way up by our wonderful server  my friend was unhappy with guacamole and its overwhelming lime flavor our server was beyond accommodating and he had the kitchen make a fresh batch without lime and bring limes to her to add as much as she wanted when my dinner enchiladas came out i felt really bad making my own complaint about the unexpected sour cream sauce when i had expected regular red enchilada sauce once again our wonderful server fixed it right away everything we had was tasty to be sure there are family owned authentic places that are better but solid and enjoyable and great service id stop by again","5199":"great food late at night  we were out and wanted something but didnt want to go thought a drive thru  ihop is 24 hours which is perfect  seated immediately and the food was great  i got french onion pot roast with gravy and corn  if its late and youre hungry i recommend ihop","5200":"yum do i love a combination cold cuts banh mi sandwich  seasons cafe is a cute little place in a minimall off gandy  it is clean welllit and full of friendly and efficient staff  i had the banh mi and while it was more expensive than im used to 399 vs 299 at my favorite place on waters in tampa the roll was quite large and i couldnt finish it so id say its a pretty good deal  the veggies were fresh and crispy and i loved the generous spread of pate  i did not find the meat overly fatty  also the fresh avocado boba was fantastic with lots of avocado although not the best boba ive had  being right off gandy ave in pinellas co its almost as convenient as the waters area to south tampa so i very well might return","5203":"the cryptic note read out of donuts  my brother had left it on my dads kitchen of course by the time i arrived the conversation started with we have to go early to get donuts  what donuts why all this talk about donutsmy dad had a coupon and wanted his donuts  we went early saturday morning fate was on our side  there was a parking spot right in front guess what the donuts were good i cant say they were great but they were good the crumb pastry however was great oh and so was the cherry pie  still warm from the oven  yoris is clearly a good place good enough that an 89 year old guy will nag his kids to get them to take him there for a treat","5204":"it makes me really happy that there are a plethora of great beer drinking spots in the indianapolis area with that said i thoroughly enjoyed upland in carmel the bartender is very knowledgeable of their beer and is quick to offer tastings to ensure the customers have a good experience  my favorite beer was the coast buster imperial ipa and everyone around me was enjoying their beers as well  oh and it is very affordable i was shocked when i got the bill and each beer was only 4 the food was good not great so im giving them 4 stars definitely recommend this place for a few beers i would not go back to eat   i believe they might specialize in making sour beers as well sold in bottles ill have to check that out next time","5205":"great ice cream at decent prices can you ask for much more got to admit weve been making our own ice cream and while its good we havent figured out how they get theirs that creamy will keep trying but will also keep visiting to gather intelligence of course","5206":"ive been here twice after purchasing sharing sprees and i had good experiences both times  parking is a breeze they are generally pretty full at lunch hour but we managed to find a spot okay  they also had applesauce as an alternative to french fries for the kids menu so im a fan of their healthier options  overall good bartv watching spot  and if you like friend pickles theirs are really great","5207":"excellent concept going on here in pa  me being a californian i am obviously biased that in n out has a superior product as far as this concept  but i will say this i was very impressed  i liked how you could build your burger with a list of fresh ingredients that in the end was a fresh juicy burger made exactly how i like it  cool option of regular fries or cajonhighly recomended  i do have just one complaint however the buns  if you bought an offbrand bottom shelf pack of buns from an old dirty liquor store and left them in your trunk for a week or so there you have it  but everything else is great","5208":"love this diner my boyfriend and i come here regularly since its so close to our apartment dont even try coming here on a saturday or sunday morning though it gets super busy the waitstaff has all been super pleasant even when they are really busy this is probably the first diner ive ever been to where they actually cook bacon correctly its a little pricier than i would normally expect from a diner but it is better than most","5209":"food is good well cooked pasta and fresh ingredients only food complaint is that the bread still looks like those readybake freezer rolls servers and bar tenders are all friendly if a bit over worked wait times can be very long at 730pm on a friday it was 6595 minutes i got in line on my phone but by the time i got there at 8 i was able to be seated immediately because i was alone and was willing to sit at the bar food came out fast even on a friday evening though i did get pasta and not pizza which may have helped this location feels less crowdedhas more space than the rock hill location but consequently it also gets a bit more loudechoy in my opinion so pick your poison","5210":"had dinner here one even and the food was awesome  ok the beer was awesome which probably enhanced my food experience   my coworker was sober and said it was good so ill take her word for it  great neighborhood joint and would definitely be back","5211":"the tacos here are so good delicious simple wellmade tacos while this place might not pop out as the most inviting of places as it is a kind of hard to find unless you are looking for it and b not the prettiest place in the world it is definitely worth checking out the carnitas tacos are definitely the shining star but they offer a range of exactly the sorts of tacos you would expect to see on a menu at a taco joint that are all pretty well done for my money i still think las americas makes a better taco but this place is much more convenient to get to from where i live i would not go here expecting a fancy dinner or the best ambience but if you are on the west side and in the mood for great tacos and dont mind a nofrills environment this should at the very least be among your top choices in my opinion","5213":"cheap winewill be back for that for sure decent selection of grocery items as well dont come for the atmosphere though you will be disappointed","5214":"i am the girl that gets the same thing anywhere she goes the scotch egg burger at the brewpub is one of my favorites you have to add egg and cheese with the pub chips and a side of the beer cheese    i havent ordered anything different in a long time except the beer cheese crock if i am not by myself  i generally head to the brewpub when i am in the mood for the burger and am always impressed with the various beers on tap i feel they do a wonderful job of making sure that they have something for everyone and as the oldest brewpub in indy they had a head start on everyone else i definitely recommend their ipa","5218":"passeros is definitely a shining spot in the dregs of suburban station really decent coffee both iced and hot nice selection of baked goods  especially their carrot cake squares which have a layer of cream cheese frosting in the middle  wow so delicious and moist they also have a good rotation of soups as well as small salads oatmeal and yogurt this has become my goto spot in the morning before heading up to work the staff is also fantastic  friendly even early in the morning definitely hit them up over dunkin donuts or au bon pain","5223":"the most crowded restaurant in the pier you may have to wait for nearly an hour before to be seated the famous dishes here are crab lobster and shrimp we ordered a lobster taco and it was really good the shrimp is also very fresh too great experience even better if there is less people","5225":"a bit pricey but delicious i love the constant rotation of flavors and all the toppings oh so many toppings to choose from","5232":"great baked goods especially their birthday cake the dense buttery frosting and cake w the fruity pebbles or whatever cereal it is embedded inside is so delicious","5233":"visited here for the first time ever today i really liked it alot the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have near as much variety as whole foods they had some awesome deals on meat for a tuesday i think they have these type of specials every tuesday i will definitely be back","5234":"this is a great meatseafoodspecialty item market although ive never had the occasion to use their catering service im sure it is top notch and would recommend trying it   harrs seems to have the largest selection of quality meats in the immediate area they are also one of the very few places to procure dry aged prime beef try their specialty kabobs for a treat while there are several excellent seafood markets in pinellas county harrs quality and selection make it a convenient stop especially if meat is the primary reason for the trip they will happily clean shrimp for 2pound extra overall their prices are extremely reasonable and comparable to the chain supermarkets  they also have a full selection of wines and specialty items as well as deli and both fresh and frozen prepared foods made on site this is definitely not a place to go when hungry open the door and the aromas will beckon you to step in a little further on initial glance it might appear to be any small market once past the check stand a whole foodie haven awaits warning at this point unless you are only one of five people in the place walk directly to the meat counter and grab a number  note the crowd gathered here  it takes a while   note if you call in your order ahead of time there is a place to pick it up and you dont have to wait in line it will be prepared to order wrapped and ready for you   my only beef is that the produce selection is very limited and not quite as fresh as one would expect for that reason alone i rated them a 4 versus a 5 ive yet to find anyone that can rival the fresh markets when it comes to produce  so if youre in the neighborhood drop in and check it out as i saiddont go hungry you could always run next door to mecca for a nosh first look beyond the check stand and take your time browsing i guarantee you wont leave empty handed","5237":"this will likely become a 5star review when i have a taste of my 2nd 3rd or  well we can stop counting after that right  i tried their stout mastadon stout brewed for the ismyelp paleo party and loved it it wasnt as cofee as i expected instead it brought a lot to the party no pun intended i could tell they put a lot of thought and heart into the brew   i think we have a winner bring on the next pint","5238":"old world coffee  reno nv  we just dined at pegs glorified eggs and walked over to old world coffee for a little caffeine i was in need of a quick pick me up before we headed to michael d thompson trailhead i got their espresso and it was paired with a shot of h2o ive never had a coffee house pair a small glass of water with my espresso stumptown doesnt even do this this is saying a lot old world coffee is basically telling me that their espresso is so strong that i will need to chase it with water i took a sip of my espresso and was amazed on how fresh bold and strong it was it only took a couple of sips to wake me up and get my groove back old world serves an awesome espresso    the cafe itself is small with a few tableschairs the entire place is clean and the staff is very knowledgeable about their drinks i recommend old world coffee","5239":"the food here is good not great  it is very busy during brunch if you arrive around 1 pm you should have no problem getting a seat in short order  i ordered the monte cristo sandwich i did appreciate the french toast for the bread but the ham was a standard supermarket lunchmeat  my dining partner had the breakfast sammy and was happy with his choice if you use the yelp app to secure a place in line you will check in with the hostess at the time requested and should still have another 20 minute wait  not as reliable as an open table reservation but thankfully they have the option","5240":"fantastic food gourmet burgers and shakes  all local and organic our only complaint is that its not real kidfriendly  only 2 items on the kids menu over all great experience","5241":"very good dinner of vietnamese and thai dishes at a reasonable price flavorful and presented well","5242":"four stars for service excellent waiters and waitresses they could definitely improve in the foodbrunch department 15 bottomless mimosas were a plus my friend had a cup of gumbototally needs workthe roux was great color but lacked flavorive also never seen chopped carrots in gumbo but some include that as a part of the trinity of base ingredients the bywater breakfast was tasty i subbed the potatos for cheese grits the grits were ok but kinda lumpy and they chopped up my bacon and scrambled it wth my eggs with out asking i ate it anyways lol the rasberry jam was a nice touch i did however get some cracklings to go and they were delicious next time i will try the boudin","5245":"as a vegetarian it is easy to take places like the bottleworks for granted schlaflys has been workin it out in the wood for a long time now the food is always aboveaverage and the place is large and usually easy to get a table in so i had to ask my gf recently why dont we wind up here more often so weve decided to try to do just that we want to support the localfocus and very vegetarian friendliness of places like this  the good pretty good beer vegetarian options including the ability usually to swap out match meat on many dishes and pretty good service with a big big patio  i guess my only quibbles is that it would be super cool to have some more vegetarian and vegan focus on the menu without having to ask and the decor i sometimes feel like im eating in a warehouse the tap room is far superior on this count for my money","5246":"store has developed the feel of a chain coffee shop but quality of coffee is still high friendly staff fast service","5248":"schlafly bottleworks is one of my favorite places to go to in st louis  for being a craft brewery their food is also very good and you can tell they take great pride in it  the atmosphere is very causal but classy  the facility is very large so there is a lot of room  they have an outdoor covered patio which is very cool  they also have live music several nights during the week  their beer has been a staple in st louis for over 20 years  i would recommend schlafly to anyone who is a craft beer fan","5250":"the best part of eating here are the desserts they are fantastic the beer of course is tasty and fresh a brew for everyone the food is good with generous portions as well definitely a place to return to","5251":"went about 30 minutes before their closing time  it was fairly empty ordered 2 5s 500 burgers  fries  drink got 1 spicy  1 non spicy fries a blackwhite milkshake  a strawberry milkshake the milkshakes were so tasty made with local bassetts  ice cream they hit the spot immediately   had asked for the burgers to be cooked medium ended up with an almost well done burger the burger wasnt dry at all sauce was good but not anything special the burger looked pretty small but it ended up being very filling fries were okay the spicy fries tasted like herrs hot chips food was better than expected but on the pricier side for burgers 27 for 2 burgers fries  milkshakes   in all it was a good experience pretty solid burger place good for a quick bite","5253":"cant say much wrong with this place they have many donut choices and are always making them fresh they also tend to make the same ones everyday so something you like is always there i love the maple bars and the old fashioned ones donut holes are also great grab a drink milk or some coffee and youve got a pretty amazing treat on your hands because theyre fresh cooked which tastes better anyway you want to check this place early after a certain time they stop making them to avoid a lot of day old donuts the donuts are great and cheap so pick up a few","5254":"we were in the mood for tacos and this place had great reviews so we headed over  it is very hidden but it helps to know its behind thorntons  we got 4 tacos the campechana and a horchata  the guy that was helping us was super friendly and was happy to give suggestions and explain what the menu was since it was all in spanish  they even split the tacos on two plates for us  i got the chicken and steak and my husband got 2 barbacoa tacos  i dont really have a lot of experience with these kind of tacos so i dont have a clear comparison of what would be considered amazing but i wasnt aww stricken by these tacos  i didnt feel like they had too much flavor  there was this green salsa stuff on the table that helped bring out some flavor  i liked that the meat was finely chopped so it was easy to eat  i also liked the corn tortillas  the campechana on the other hand was really really good  it is the same idea as ceviche but this has shrimp and octopus  it was really refreshing and sweet  it was a nice balance between the heat of the taco to the cooling of the campechana  i really liked the feel of this place and how friendly the staff was  i would come back again","5255":"walked to district donuts on my lunch break from work ive been wanting to try that place for a while and i am so glad i did i did not put 5 stars because i was hoping to try their bacon donut but they did not have it at the time i bought 2 huge donuts for less than 6 in total mango  pink peppercorn and cuba libre a perfect lunch on a cheating day","5258":"great ice cream and baked goods simple traditional stuff only but its good nothing trendy about this place though the prices are a little high you can eat outside and overhear lots of family conversations","5259":"what a gem of north redington beach a great hole in the wall with awesome pricing foods you must try the shubee shack crab cakes and the crab balls very yummilicious   place your order at the little window and relax on one of the benches while chef pat makes your meal fresh and hot i had the crab balls nicely crisp on the outside and crabby and soft on the inside a fresh delicious beachy experience","5262":"i survived opening day at 500 degrees and came out very satisfied with our new addition to 15th and sansom  burgers  55oz burger on a tall brioche bun made to order medium rare was juicy and delicious  its not as good as the burger at village whiskey but its about as good as the aged beef burger at marathon grill  i was concerned about the size but between that and the plain fries these truffle fries were overrated i was wiping the plate and feeling great  goodbye five guys hello 500 degrees","5269":"great boba place that reminds me of cali kind of ridiculous that regular boba isnt included in the price though once they screwed up my boba order and just dumped the drink into a new cup with the right boba with me losing 1520 of my drink that sucked considering theyre kinda expensive starbucks level pricing they have a lot of tables and a few couches and board games nice place to hang out with ac and outlets","5271":"the pecan pie is great the filling is not too thick not too thin there is a generous amount of pecans and i love the crust the pies with chocolate in them are really rich there is a mild graininess from sugar but i like it this is a local product and i am happy to support a well made pie looking at the two other reviews im surprised at the negative reports im thinking there are all kinds of ways to make pies and to condemn one because it is not exactly the one way you like best seems to be taking  a very narrow view of the everexpanding universe of pie well i like it","5272":"excellent food dont miss it the meat is perfectly cook and the desserts are out of this world highly recommend it","5273":"quality baked goods and a huge selection russian tea cakes  yummy","5277":"i like going here because there is a nice seating area outside and the food is delicious im not a huge fan of their standard beers but love their sours i would give them a 55 if they had sours on tap","5281":"this is my first time at a sprout chain this store reminds me of a blend of trader joes and fresh market theres a great deli section something tj lacks and ample veggies plus prices are far better than fresh market and whole check i mean whole foods lol  avocados were 31 strawberries were 1 and they had lots of organic options i tried a few of the samples that were being given out and everything was really good there are not a lot of cash registers so i do see long waits possibly being a problem in the future","5289":"at first we thought it might be a bit expensive however the quality exceeds the pricing","5291":"edgehill cafe is a nicely designed coffee shop with lots of natural lighting and a cool earthy vibe yes this trendy place for ideal for hipsters i really like how much room is available for seating and it is great that they also serve tasty hot food hooray for sandwiches which they bring right to you when it is ready they even have a loyalty program i dont think there are really any other businesses like it in this area of town and it makes a awesome meeting space given its location in this neighborhood my only peeve about it is parking there is a small one way lot outside but you can hardly ever find parking there your best bet is a paid lot next to the complex it is located in or street parking if you are lucky","5294":"coffeebar is a good option for a coffee or a quick breakfast or lunch i honestly dont care much for regular coffee but im a sucker for mocha   their mocha is awesome id say its in the top three that ive ever had i tried their giuseppe bar and their chocolate bread pudding on different occasions both were big enough to share and tasted great well worth the almost four bucks they charged for them   the service is superb the employees are super nice and quick too they do some pretty cool latte art that never seizes to amaze me   with exposed ceilings modern paint colors exposed brick cool wall decor and a really cool looking chandelier the place is inviting and fun to hang out in","5295":"we ate here 2 years ago and couldnt wait to come back we ordered some apps octopus delicious   lamb ribs there isnt alot of meat on them but the flavor is great we also had the greek salad with the potato salad which was really good and one of our favorites we also purchased some of the honey cakes in the bakery to take home and they were delicious as well cant wait to come back again","5297":"i had the cuban sandwich i love cubans and this one didnt disappoint i also had the chocolate cake i dont know if id call it cake as it was mostly frosting lol great old italian market with a deli bakery wine shop and a place to eat this place gets busy but its worth the visit","5298":"we came in from out of town and were looking forward to a nice tour and lunch unfortunately there were no tours that day or for the rest of our time in st louis because they were shortstaffed we were pretty disappointed   we stayed for lunch though the food was hit or miss the beer biscuits were over cooked  very dark and crunchy on the edges however the blue cream cheese that was served with it was amazing   we split the bison nachos and was presented with a huge plate of nachos that were not well thought out all the chips were on the bottom held together in a sticky mass of cheese some of the chips were burned there wasnt enough sour cream or guac   what redeemed the experience back to four stars was the oatmeal stout ice cream it was amazing","5303":"had to visit the hype of the donut boom here in nola so naturally i had this business bookmarked the vibe of the cafeorder and take a seat was nice and easy it had a flow that made me feel comfortable and no over selling was made   since  it was lunch time i ordered a little gem salad which im very happy they have a couple of veggie friendly options available i also ordered the bulgogi on a bib of lettuce it was quite filling and very nice tasty i highly recommend trying this option i also ordered a cortado which was nice and strong they have limited seating as either you sit at an order sized table or you sit in a high top stool bar like style the music they were playing was rb which made it hip and fun to listen to while eating i also liked the space where they made the sandwiches it was open and you can see how the prepare their lite bites i think the donuts are made in the other location as you only see them on racks it might be better that you dont see what goes into the donuts else you might want to do a months worth of cardio to melt the butter off your hips but of course try a donut at least a bite i ordered the monte cristo croquenut to go so lets see how it holds up in the middle of the night when i try it","5307":"had a wonderful dinner tonight this was our first time here our server was excellent and went out of her way to make sure we were satisfied she had the kitchen prepared meals that were not on the menu all the ingredients were fresh and delicious it was the saturday before christmas but we were re not rushed the only reason i didnt not give it five stars is because its my first time here well see what happens in the future im sure ill make an adjustment","5309":"i went to this mcdonalds for a family birthday party my grandson wanted his 5th birthday party to be here and he loved it we brought a cake and many family and friends and it was just great i even brought some of my hip hop students and we preformed a routine the only thing that made me rate my experience 4 stars was while i was doing my hip hop routine some of the employees proceeded to laugh at me and my dancers some even video taped me like cant you youngsters just let a 56 year old pop and lock with her crew","5310":"my husband and i came here to celebrate my birthday we had been here during its prior incarnations but this was our first time at la tavola  i was pleasantly surprised we came on a wednesday when they have their couples night out special 2 dine for 35 appetizer 2 entrees dessert and drinks  we ordered frittura mista salmon livornese me veal sorrentino hubs and tiramisu it was all so delicious  the ambience was pleasant the service was great my only complaint was that our server kept checking in on us every couple minutes it was a bit annoying  massimo chef and owner stopped by our table before we left i love being able to tell the chef how wonderful his food was and how much we enjoyed his restaurant  im so glad that smyrna has a nice dining establishment on its square","5311":"ive stopped by here a couple of times since their fairly recent opening both for dinner and just to get a couple drinks and i am impressed with this new place it is a nice addition to the area and provides a dining experience that feels a little different than anything else around here right now  first of all they did a great job with the space there wasnt much of the historic building left to start with so it doesnt necessarily have a feel of an old historic place even though the history is interesting but it is an attractive space and has an upscale feel without being stuffy its much larger than i expected it to be based on the original building the hostess stand is downstairs with room around it to stand while waiting for a table its recommended to make a reservation at this point as there was an hour wait when we went on friday evening they have a large downstairs bar along with a couple different seating areas the separation of the space into smaller sections makes it feel a little more intimate and probably helps keep the noise down upstairs is a slightly smaller bar with more tables and a couple booths to sit at i am really looking forward to the summer when they open up the large rooftop section that you can only look at through the large glass windows now   the main thing that stood out to me on both visits is the professionalism of the staff i assume it helps that the owners of the restaurant have so many other businesses already but they were ready to go from day 1 and everyone we interacted with from the hostess to the bartenders to the servers have been top notch  it is certainly a more upscale dining experience from the standpoint of the space and the service  the bar touts the largest selection of tequila i have seen in quite some time tequila is the liquor i am the least familiar with so i cant really comment about the bottles they have but you certainly have a lot of options to choose from they also have a nice whiskey selection that is reasonably priced for the setting their list of 8 or so house cocktails sounded amazing when their bartender expertly described each one to us and they had numerous ingredients in them that were my first encounters with the beer list is only okay they have a dozen things on tap that include some local standards and some national domestic craft things there are more options in bottles and cans but it nothing too impressive   the food while good didnt blow me away like other people seem to indicate i felt like it was all good but relative to the price point it wasnt fantastic the menu is fairly small but it does have a decent amount of variety what it does offer is a unique selection of items that arent things you are going to find at many other restaurants their menu is broken down into sections primero segundo empanadas ensaladas and dulce as you can probably grasp from that it is a latin themed place the dishes are tapas style so they are fairly small our server recommended us to get a couple of items off of the primero and a couple off of the segundo section for a full meal for 2 people we ended up with brussels sprouts patatas bravas chorizo empanadas and the pork pastor everything was tasty but it wasnt anything that really felt exceptional we finished everything and while it was a filling meal we werent close to needed a togo box i think our bill for the food after tax was a little over 35 for the relatively lower priced options that we ended up with thats a decently priced meal for things that i thought werent significantly impressive but it also wasnt too much to feel the visit was at all regrettable there were certainly plenty of things on the menu that we wanted to get and had to pass on during this visit so i am sure i will be back again to try more i foresee this being a great place to stop in and get one of their delicious sounding deserts late on a winter evening  this is conveniently within walking distance of me so i didnt have to worry about parking it is located on the cultural trail so it isnt hard to get to if you parked somewhere on mass ave they do have valet parking that is available in front of the building on college ave there are also some parking options along college ave if you can find an open spot i dont recall if they actually have a small lot or not  i will definitely be back to try more of their menu and to start making my way through their list of house cocktails i definitely recommend this as a place to visit that provides a nicer atmosphere for dinner than a lot of the other options in the mass ave area it would make a great date spot as it has a great ambiance fantastic service and is quiet enough to easily hold a conversation with the person across from you im looking forward to my next visit","5313":"this place is so popular on the weekends the line moves pretty fast but get here early for seating the donuts are large delicious and made inhouse from scratch i will always be drawn to bourbon infused anything  the sliders are good and the coffee is great for the area it can get kind of smokey due to the open kitchen in the middle of the room and lack of ventilation   flavors and items rotate so when you come in here theres likely something new to try they keep the menu simple use quality ingredients and provide tasty options","5319":"came here while attending the essence festival food was so good we came 2 mornings in a row i  would suggest getting the shrimp and grits i had that with the fried fish as well and asked for gravy on the side the grits were nice and creamy shrimp was tender and the fish was fried to perfection  with just the right amount of seasoning the wait staff was also accommodating the place is a bit small so get there early or there might be a wait","5320":"my sister asked me if i was hungry at 10 pm and we were sitting in grand isle around 1030  i think they close at 11 pm you can imagine how annoying this might be to the staff but we didnt detect a hint of annoyance    im pretty sure our servers name was michelle  she was phenomenal  very kind and helpful  my sister tends to ask 15 questions about one dish and then ends up ordering something completely different  michelle if that was her name wasnt even phased    i started off with the crab cake which was really great  someone remind me to take pictures next time  then i had the brisket  it had a nice flavor and the presentation was cool  they served it atop the lyonnaise potatoes with green beans  it was moist and really tender  overall it was well worth the money  the entree was 18 i think    for desert i had the no flour chocolate cake  it was really dense almost a fudge consistency  im a big fan of a flourless cake  i also had some french press coffee  the coffee wasnt the best i had ever had but it was very caffeinated and i do love that  appetizer entree desert coffee and tip all came to 52 dollars for me my sister and her husband were 86 for 2 alcoholic drinks new york strip a burger and desert thats quite a bit of bang for your buck  i will definitely be back","5322":"it was my first time going to this place the atmosphere is really laid back and relaxed the building used to be an old school laundromat and you can still see some remnants of it which i liked the staff are super friendly and accommodating the food is healthy and organic and they also have lots of vegan and vegetarian options they are great with meeting your dietary needs i had the cabbage hand salad which was a delicious salad wrap in rice paper my only issue with the experience was finding a chicken bone in the wrap","5327":"this place was exactly what i hoped it would be super cute with good food and great desserts we got there on saturday around 1115am and had no wait at all but there was a line out the door by the time we left an hour later i had seen the pickle soup on the menu and was dying to try it so of course i ordered that as my side to the roast beef sandwich the soup was very pickley not lightly pickley but i loved it roast beef sandwich was good  simple and served on tons of crusty bread for dessert i had to try the pineapple cake in a cup with the chocolate almond joy ice cream it was a dream in a cup a really really big cup i would have eaten every bite if i didnt feel physically ill midway through from so much food i would love to come back here and it was perfect for right before a matinee at the fox","5330":"this store is so much larger than the speedway marsh the vegetables and fruit are always fresh and i love the fresh flower selection the meat department is extremely helpful so dont hesitate to ask a question they will grind meat for you and butterfly pork chops if you ask customer service cashiers and stock folks have always been courteous the store isnt laid out as you would image so be prepared to ask for assistant or go insane wandering the store not sure if the layout was experimental but much wasted space with isle layout forcing you to waste time crossing the storeworth the effort once your familiar with layout and isle since they carry more items than most marsh stores on the westside they are great about opening extra cashier lines when the lines get long and they do during the normal crazy hours","5331":"at first glance you see a small logcabinesque structure as you drive down main street in imperial then it hits you what it is with the large sign in front of it and the cars in the lot i cannot say enough about this place it usually has super fresh veggies at a reasonable cost along with other items that you can use with the veggies and fruits fresh breads too along with milk and dairy items the owners are helpful as well as those who work there as well","5332":"i enjoy a good tea especially when i am about to get on the train or a plane and know i will be dehydrated for awhile  the 30th street train station has a variety of options for tea and other drinks but i think this cosi rates the service is always good the staff really is friendly and quick to serve they realize i think that most of us are running for the train and time is of the essence and they accommodate your desires  i was able to buy a large sized tea with one tea bag and a little soy on the side now that is not something i can do at just any tea or coffee shop    i will continue to use cosi when i am travelling through the train station","5333":"great place for bagels  one of the absolute best  no puffy air bagels but good chewy ones","5335":"wow compared to the runofthemill markets out in southern maine this place rocks so much more selection than shaws so many more brands than hannafords much much better wine selection than market basket amazing grabngo section with both affordable healthy vegan and more luxurious options and this dierbergs is not even considered particularly upscale  what a hoot they have a  smoker outside selling barbecue awesome in the three times i visited this place i was never able to sample the que but the idea warmed my heart the coolest thing of all they sell wine and beer open in the store so that you can get drunk while you shop how cool is that  they say one should not shop on an empty stomach imagine what you come home with on a drunken empty stomach even better it just gets better plenty of parking and both trader joes and whole foods are in the next parking lot metro link is just around the corner too makes me want to move to st louis who would have thunk it","5337":"at the top of my christmas list this year is that someone would open a huge friendly coffeehouse near my house with wifi and plenty of outlets and a lot of room it hasnt happened yet but someone opened one up in washington west which is totally not fair since good karma is an easy walk from the awesomeness of chapterhouse  ill forestall my bitterness for now and just be glad that i can stop walking a whole two blocks than before if i really must be at a coffeehouse that much sooner good karma is big and bright and has a lot of outlets and wifi theres a large selection of baked good and drinks other than coffee and tea thats cool they have two nice bathrooms too and no one bothers you and theyre open late could this be coffeehouse love  the downsides are the foods not great theres a sign telling you not to bring food from elsewhere which i must respect but i must admit to being a little sad inside when i have to bite into one of their moist overly eggy scones knowing there are great ones out there made by our own metropolitan bakery the coffees fine as far as a brew is concerned but as a fellow yelper said the lattes leave much to be desired theyre confused as to what makes a latte and what makes a cappuccino i ordered one once and none since   but what can i say ill take the bad scones and indifferent coffee drinks for the genuine friendliness of the place and my face is as green as their mugs when i think about how spoiled that neighborhood is while my part of town is totally bereft of coffeehouse awesomeness  oh cash only though theres an expensive atm on the premises","5338":"the atmosphere and decor are awesome we love burgers so if we go to a burger joint i always have the classic burger in my opinion you have to be good at the basics before you get fancyand there are plenty of fancy burgers here the classic is better than goon but not great 4 out of 5 local grassfed beef not oversized its better than good we also tried the st louis andouille burger it was good too but needed a spicy mustard added to make it really good the buffalo burger again was good the fries are outstanding along with the rooster sauce and house ketchup we also enjoyed the siracha mayo and sweet and spicy hot mustard great selection of local beers on tap also loved the selection on boozy teas and boozy lemonade the summer shandy is great they also have an amazing selection of bottled soda for real not just coke products but dry sodas cream sodas ginger soda izze sodas ect we topped off our meal with boozy shakes they also have homemade ice cream sundaes banana splits brownie sundaes and waffle bowlscones worth the 15 mile walk from our hotel this is an awesome dining experience","5340":"nice little donut spot on the corner its pretty small inside so might get cramped when youre ordering the donuts were delicious tho and so were the pies could use some updating minus a star for the aesthetic i guess if it aint broke dont fix it coffee was great","5341":"you cant beat the prices at aldi you just cant the normal amount you spend at other stores will get you twice as much here i always find new items or brands that my family actually prefers over national brands their special buys section is awesome because i almost always find something that i need or had on my wish list for some time   this store is my usual store even though another one is probably closer to me i love the staff at this store they are always friendly and helpful if youre a regular like i am they will definitely recognize a familiar and friendly face the store is always clean and well organized sometimes the special buys area can get a little out of hand but thats what happens when you have so much good stuff you run out of places to put it   aldi is actually a germanowned company so every year they feature german week with goodies actually brought in from germany i dont know that much about germany but i know they make some good stuff their produce section has a really good selection but just be aware that you wont find everything that other stores carry such as kale or other exotic items but very good for the basics   tips for any first timers bring your own bags you can also purchase plasticpaper if needed bring a quarter for cart rental which you get back and off you go no coupons needed they only take debit cards or cash so make sure any cards you are carrying includes at least one debit","5346":"surprisingly expedient service for a perfect spring day and a packed patio i ordered the southern fried amazing spicy shrimp no complaints and korean bbq a little too saucy for me which i didnt think was possible but it happened my only gripe would be the lack of chip refill but when the table next to us left i unashamedly claimed their mostly full basket as our own","5347":"i had the bourbon street breakfast  i didnt realize it came with real bourbon which youre supposed to pour on top of the banana pecan pancakes  it was worth the wait  keep in mind you have to be patient if theyre really busy  decor is traditional french quarter and it feels very cozy when youre here","5348":"too cramped and too snooty but all is forgiven when you taste their coffee which is outstanding  if youre staying plan to do so in nice weather so you can snag one of three patio tables  sitting inside youre sure to have someones ass in your face  this is definitely a grab and go joint  i would prefer that they abandoned indoor seating altogether so that the wait is less claustrophobic","5350":"a must stop in tarpon springs exceptional greek food fantastic service and the cutest bakery","5353":"the churros  still drooling over them so much that the meal was almost an afterthought  shared a variety of things including the table side guac spicy queso fundido was good but a bit greasy and a variety of street tacos everything was delicious but heavy so i recommend visiting on a very empty stomach  i also really enjoyed the jalepeno margarita  the ipad ordering seemed a bit awkward thats why im giving a 4 star","5354":"a cool little brewery to the east of downtown their bar space is newer with several large tables and a good amount of chairs it does get packed after work especially later in the week  easy to walk out with a growler  local art decorate the walls they also have a few tvs beer is very tasty and theyll usually have a food truck available  stone bar with no rail and metal our stools with no back support the bar back is very simple with just a chalkboard and taps solid service and great bear","5365":"im not much of a beer connaisseur but i enjoyed 16 ounces of guava king with my family upstairs there are free games which entertained my nieces and nephews while the adults had a chance to chat great spot for an afternoon with family","5366":"as my bellevue sweet spot ceces beacons for me near the bellevue cinema i pull slow on the selfserve handle remembering the spew of thick fro yo from last time i was at sweet ceces swirling the berry and chocolate yogurt into my cup was accomplished then topped with three of the maraschino cherries and other fresh fruit like always i practiced my tongue skills on the stems until tied","5367":"i was more than a little hesitant to try teavana after reading reviews of pushy salespeople but praise be to yelp they mustve learned their lesson because i was here two days in a row with two completely different staff and while there was a lot of explainingdemoing there was no pressure in fact today a wonderful salesperson dissuaded me from buying the overly expensive starter kit and rather get me a tea i liked  a tin  tumbler on sale please note this starter setup was half the cost of the actual kit  i was thoroughly impressed with the staff who were able to guess exactly which tea i wanted after i blankly starred at them and said i dunno i think its green tea based with fruit even more impressive was the reassurance that you will know if you will like the tea simply by smell i didnt believe it but totally true  cool note teavana was purchased by starbucks last year so those starbucks gift cards work here and if you have a registered card you can accrue stars here as well","5368":"mmmm hashbrowns what else can i say the food here was really good its a tasty breakfast  lunch place i was impressed with this little cafe had pancakes that were so buttery and light but those hashbrowns are killer garlicy or something we also ordered a spinach omlette that was really good","5370":"i like to come here sometimes since its very close to my work location their lunch combo is very good you get a drink a sandwich and side of potato saladchipsapple i always get the potato salad because its so good i am a vegetarian so i dont have a lot of options but i do like their veg out sandwich its very healthy and not too many calories i always get it on a whole wheat bread they also have a drive thru even tho its not the best drive thru in the world but it is convenient when you wanna grab something quick on your way","5371":"about a week ago we went to katies for our second visit with some close friends we had wanted to sit outside like we did on our first visit but it had rained and the patio was shut down   so we sat inside the interior of the restaurant is well laid out and tastefully done we were there relatively early 530 and the restaurant was about half full initially the noise level was fine slightly loud but manageable however as the restaurant filled up it soon became impossible to have a conversation at a normal level im sure they can make some modifications to the interior to help manage the ambient sound  the food was very good we tried the meatball pizza which didnt disappoint  hopefully katies will address the sound in the interior or well only come back in patio season","5373":"what a starbucks across from ccs  and they are open till 9pm when ccs closes at 5 interesting choice to make the interior is beautiful and it seems there is an entrance from outside and also the lobby of the main building  great views of poydras from the window and it looks like there is lots of seating","5377":"a more conventionalformal seating layout in this restaurant but the food is still reliably good seafood  just like the original in indian rocks beach this chain is the place to go for tasty and affordable seafood in a casual atmosphere  what really sets this place apart from the others is that this location is across the street from clearwater beah so its a nice place to retreat for lunch after a day on the beach  and if you get a window seat you can get the view of the marina and a beautiful sunny day typical of florida ","5379":"this location is close to our home we dont go very often but have been there maybe a dozen times  the inside is clean the tables are clean and the workers are always nice and respectful   the food is pretty good but their blizzards and moolatas are soooo very good  trey are always freshly made and always exactly what we order   its a great stop on a hot day to cool down the orange julius is so refreshing any time of the day","5380":"pizza is pretty good prices are reasonable portions are decent and theyre open late on the weekends location is pretty convenient too  especially coming from one of the local bars i think franks has better pizza but they close much earlier","5382":"some of the best icecream ive eaten in st louis they have a sign explaining why their icecream is so good go for the icecream you will not be disappointed this business is in a fun part of the city which makes it easy to add this to your schedule for the night","5386":"doesnt anyone work in this city if not and they have a new york times a macbook and lots of black clothing theyre at la colombe in the morning  generally the line goes out the door but the service by the 3daystubble beautiful boys is spot on they make the orders licketysplit and their full tip jar is testimony to how they rock and roll   really great part real creme in a china creamer long spoons granular brown sugar and a saucer even if youre getting a cup to go  get the cappuccino their froth is the best in philly","5387":"fast food is exactly what it says and implies their burgers are equal or better than the competition  there new attempt at mexican makes me want to ask for my money back but breakfast now that is where they excel and leave competition in their dust i am not a bread person and always watch the fat content but when it comes to their golden flakey totally delicious biscuts or sweet rolls forget it i am gone gone to hardees in a flash when i get that occasional overwhelming urge to indulge in their breakfast  my favorite is bacon egg cheese biscuit 2 slices of nice crisp bacon and for once the chese is always melted  dont order just 1 make sure you get 2 or you will be too far away when your tummy screams more  of course you can get them with other meats than bacon and cheese or not is your option lets not forget those yummy sweet rolls no not tea house good fast food great cinnamon  spiced just right and not too sweet bread is soft and hard at the same time and in the right places  then drizzled with icing and always served warm so yummyyou have to try them for yourself whats a girl to do why are their so few hardees  around tampa","5390":"great market in medford just purchased a fine porterhouse steak grilled vegetables stuffed long hots italian meatballs eggplant parm homemade soup im set for the weekend they also have deli meats and a ton more food good local shop happy they were open today in the snow storm cant wait to cook the steak tonight","5391":"i have been to the taquiera calpenas at the camden and columbus flea market locations  the tacos are fresh stuffed reasonably priced and delicious  my favorites ones are the steak chicken pastor and carnitas","5393":"great place before i even tried the italian veggie wrap or the southwestern chicken wraps i purchased i liked this place  outgoing people that work there super cool atmosphere not too much  and a lot of food for the price a little gem on the corner for sure","5394":"i remember this place from when it used to be zenas recently all ive stopped in for is coffee but the staff is friendly and the atmosphere inviting i do wish theyd pour the coffee for you instead of handing you an empty cup to put the drink together yourself coffee sugar cream etc but still keeps me coming back","5395":"i have been searching for a good moscow mule vodka lime ginger beer ever since i was introduced to the drink last year by a friend in denver where they are apparently all the rage  village pub is the first place ive been to in nashville that seems to have caught the spirit of the spirit  they use pewter mugs rather than the traditional copper mugs but the metal still gets frigid right down to the handle which makes it feel close enough to a proper mule for my liking at 6 it is a wellpriced cocktail and they have several different variations if vodka is not for you  for the mules alone i will be sure to come back to village pub  other things they have going for them  1 a nice assortment of local beers its hip to be local these days i know but these folks seem really committed to local  for example on tap they have czanns brewery which is a oneman operation here in nashville from a fellow who brews bottles and distributes all of his own product   and 2 a really relaxed welcoming atmosphere  both the indoor and the outdoor seating was cozy and the staff was very warm  the only thing that drags village pub down i think is the food  they specialize in pretzel sandwiches the notion of which i found really exciting but the sandwich interior was only soso with a disappointingly dryish pretzel  it is certainly nice to have access to some nibbles while at the bar in any case so no real harm done    come for the mule stay for some local drafts and try not to build up too many expectations for the food","5396":"yummy great flavor choices and a lot of different toppings for you to add at  40 per ounce i can see quite a few revisits","5408":"it should be 45 stars a nice young couple ryan and kaitlin make their own pierogies learning from the ukrainian ladies at the cathedral parish at 8th and brown they usually stuff them with potato and cheese but they do use other ingredients like  blueberries or cherriesthey buy good kielbasa from czerws but i especially like their stuffed cabbage or galubki holupchi being ukrainian i have eaten all of these foods for a long time the galubki are better than any i have tasted recently they come with a little spicy tomato sauce just like my moms they move around a bit navy yard the linc and at clark park on most saturdays check their fb page if you see their little cart stop by for a nice lunch","5411":"coffee shoppe like starbucks located in hyde park village lots of outside seating which is great for people watching","5414":"one of a handful of trendy vegetarian places that uses wood everywhere to feel earthy you great a pretty large amount for the price i recommend the bistro bella the tapenade they make for it goes great with the mushroom do not recommend the udon salad its like sad 3 day old chinese food with lettuce on the bottom   the place is fairly popular so the lines can be long and theres not that much seating so its not great for a group and its so loud you cant work or really have an decent talk with anyone honestly i prefer take out you can also order ahead for pick up","5416":"i have enjoyed firehouse subs on three separate occasions now  all three sandwiches were delicious  what i like about firehouse is the understandning that a 6 sub is too small and 12 is a bit much  sandwiches are available in an 8 or larger size  a large assortment of sauces bbq and hot are available to dress your sandwich    please note firehouse subs was started by firemen and staff may ask you to round up your bill to the nearest dollar to donate to their foundation   from the website the firehouse subs public safety foundation is dedicated to improving the lifesaving capabilities of first responders and public safety organizations in communities served by firehouse subs by providing funding resources and support  also note this place has a coca cola freestyle machine and you may wait in line for a bit while kids play with every flavor combination possible","5417":"so i stumbled into this place because i bought a sharing spree voucher and im glad i did i really liked the tequila lime chickenit was fabulous i brought a friend who is preggers and lets just say the queso made her very happy it is definitely better than your average queso overall my experience was good i liked the patio with the option of covered or not it is a super cute little restaurant my only complaint would be parking is a nightmare but really that is no ones fault its in such a cute little neighborhood and theres just no way around it","5418":"though i am no longer living in philly the owner of axis pizza reached out to me and offered a gift card to try the new pizza in ernest he agreed with aspects of my review and wanted to let me and you know that axis has new brick ovens  this gesture was beyond expected and if i were living in philly id be back at axis in an instant  gift certificate notwithstanding  its a gem to find owners so caring and open to feedbackso please give axis a go and let me know how it is","5419":"love this place  the folks here are very friendly  this is the only place in this area that i will go to get my plum fix  i love love black plums  we also buy our christmas tree here too  the other local produce is delicious also","5421":"delicious burgers and truffle fries and they have a neat soda selection reasonable price i usually spend about 12 burger lovers should definitely try this place","5422":"mike was a 5 star server  food tastes good not 5 star but tasty interior is slightly dated carpet definitely needs to be replaced red paint chipping on the walls theyd definitely benefit from an upgrade","5424":"1215 pm ordered five dollar fill up meal and it was hot and fresh filled order in less than a minute dining room was clean too friendly staff in a dated but busy store","5426":"never was a donut person until this place hands down my weakness i love this place","5427":"the best bakery cookies ive ever had  there are always a ton of options to choose from and they are all delicious  my favorite are the white chocolate dipped fudge cookies  people get really excited when i show up at a party with a swiss haus box  when i show up without it not so excited    ive only had their hazelnut cake by the slice and i was not at all impressed  it was really dry  this was back in the swiss pastry shop days so maybe its better now  their cupcakes are good and cheap  ive never seen them get crazy with the flavors but they do the basic chocolate and vanilla well   if you are feeling for something a bit more exotic try the clichy  its pricier than the cupcakes but oh  goodness  youll be wondering how you made it through your whole life without knowing the ganache covered multilayered joy that is the clichy    i love this place i just really need to get over there early for doughnuts some day  as for the service the people who work there are just lovely    man  now i really want a clichy","5428":"ordered the crab sandwich and garlic clams clams were delicious sandwich was a bit dry  ate 12 of it a couple of hours later and it was a lot better   space was your typical nautical theme enjoyed everything but the pigeons roaming around in the restaurant","5430":"definitely was not expecting such an awesome craft beer selection as far as i know they dont sell anything cold and youll be hard pressed to find anything smaller than a 12pack great prices","5434":"the food is great here there is usually a wait to get in usually not unlike most other good restaurants in new orleans the bacon bloody mary tastes amazing and is full of flavor we had the shrimp and grits a staple when coming here  the fried oyster benedict both were filling and flavorful great place to get a new orleans breakfast or brunch","5435":"this is one of my favorite coffee shops to get work done at they have free wifi plenty of seating and play indie music on low volume good karma also has an outdoor oasis in the back which it seems not many know about wouldnt say this is the place for coffee connoisseurs because i dont think they roast or brew their own coffee however drinks are solidly delicious and unique and ambiance is very chill","5437":"my friend and i came here wanting to explore a new coffee shop we were pleasantly surprised the cafe was busy with almpat no seats available we were able to snag a couple of seats while we waited for our maple lattes the coffee was great it wasnt too sweet and the granola was awesome i will say that the parking is ok its defintely easier than tampa but can be hard to find on the weekend there is also street parking that doesnt require you to parallel park ","5440":"i heard about sofresh from a few people to i decided to give it a try for lunch one day  i ordered the sofresh signature salad and added chicken  it consisted of a spring mix with goat cheese avocado grape tomatoes cucumbers onions shredded carrots raisins pistachios fresh herb vinaigrette  the chicken was freshly grilled and all of the flavors of the salad meshed very well together i actually didnt even use the dressing the portion was perfect and rather large i was definitely full after eating the entire salad i like how the menu offers salads bowls and wraps that way there is something for everyone the food came out quickly and the service was great i will definitely be returning","5443":"great food we loved the sandwiches but wish there was more to choose from loved the unique design and mellow atmosphere","5445":"oh i adore this place even though it reminds me of walmart for alcohol there is an amazing selection and unbeatable prices at wine and beyond every wine imaginable they have  i was pleasantly surprised to find out that they carried some of my okanagan favourites absolutely lovely   i think one of the best features this place has to offer is the wine tastings and samples of beer they offer you can also buy large jugs of beer from their taps that are significantly cheaper and refillable  way to save the environment and my wallet wine and beyond   in my few trips to this place ive also found some lovely house decor  including a very large wine glass that i intend to fill with wine corks   i could wander this store aimlessly for hours  its heaven","5447":"weve eatendrank here about 3 times including the night of the soft opening   every time has been excellent  the wings have a great smokey flavor with a spicy finish  the domestic beers are also cheap at 3   the chips they serve as sides with the sandwiches are also really good and cooked perfectly","5448":"good starbucks location and easy to get in and out of this location has a larger front patio with plenty of outdoor seating  if you so choose  the inside is also a good size friendly staff and i was in and out almost tempted to grab a glass of wine instead but stayed the course and went for s jolt","5450":"this is an unassuming place in a small shopping center on rt 29 in collegeville not much to look at from the outside but the inside is where the good food is served they have daily lunch specials and for less than 1000 you could get three enchiladas tacos or burritos in chicken or beef with a generous side of rice and beans theyre not skimpy on the cheese either fresh salsa and chips has some heat but its very good service is also friendly and fast downside is that they dont serve alcohol but its a byob","5451":"im not crazy about cupcakes but decided to stop in recently  although the space is small the decor is very cute  i thought the cupcakes were reasonably priced and very tasty  i dont really care for marshmallows yet i  think the smore cupcake was my favorite","5455":"we have a sweet tooth and gave this place a try after visiting the science center  wow the decor in this place is off the wall  very eclectic and unique  they have a ton of choices  i got the nutty americano which is espresso bean ice cream with hot fudge and butter pecan  very rich and smooth  my wife got the italian orange which was also very flavorful  my son got the chocolate brownie in a cup  i redeemed my yelp for free worlds smallest ice cream come  so so funny  you gotta see the size on this thing  all in all lots of different varieties and they have savory dishes as well  definitely worth coming back if we are ever in the st louis area  they do not have free parking so we just paid meter on the street  highly recommended","5457":"my wrap was amazing i had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was hot very hot it did take a while to get it though and it wasnt even packed i definitely would not go around lunch time as the wait will be too long i try to go after one when the lunch rush is over will definitely be backafter the lunch rush though lol","5461":"delicious the gyoza and rock shrimp tempura apps were amazing and the small sushi  sashimi was a perfect portion for two make sure to bring your own booze and enjoy the freshness and great service","5462":"donuts are always fresh friendly service they bake fresh donuts throughout the day if youre lucky you can get one that is still warm best in saint louis","5467":"i went to the foodery a few weeks ago with my fiance to meet up with someone who recommended it we got paninis mine was the pastrami and the meat was very flavorful it was slightly pricey but there was a nice sit down area the place reminds me of something between a groceryconveniencecafe store that also has beer cider and coffee that has a huge selection of craft beer and cider i was able to buy a wyndridge farms cider my favorite i would return but mostly just to buy some craft cider","5468":"hkstyle milk tea  four stars  not quite sure why there are two saint honore pastries business listings on yelp but i have been checking in to this one  boyfriend and i go by it all the time while in chinatown but it never crossed our mind to try it  i think we might have tried it once a year or two ago but it wasnt memorable  i decided to try the hkstyle milk tea not too long ago and was hooked  i think i went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea only to realize that i should really watch my sugar intakeits sooo good    i personally dont think its better than zhong gangs hkstyle milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them not enough ice too much ice etc  on a side note  i wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun but accidentally said the wrong name in chinese and got the roast pork bun  it was decent enough although i will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon    i will be back","5470":"its a cute little convenience store with high prices still i like it because of the exotic treats you can find here including japanese and european candy   i stopped by the other night and was tempted to buy my favorite german candy bar ritter sport milk chocolate with whole hazelnuts alas it was 299 at pink dolphin i can get it for 199 at trader joes things like pocky koala march and yanyan yummy japanese treats are also more expensive than they should be   oh well the staff is always pretty friendly and like i said its cute","5471":"my favorite diner in the area the decor is out of place and looks funny but the food is good and the service is good everybody there is friendly","5473":"this is a fantastic place for breakfast and lunch in the french quarter   its just honest simple good food for a great price  ive had nearly everything from this little place   pastries pancakes egg breakfasts chicken ceasar salads sandwiches mimosas yes they have mimosas  just know that its a pretty small place and can get packed pretty quickly but be patient the line usually goes pretty fast though the tables dont always clear fast enough for my liking  if you want something fast delicious and of high quality for the price i would definitely recommend this spot","5481":"better than your average subway i am extremely impressed with the service here they are very efficient and friendly","5482":"super cute new breakfast spot  interesting menu and great vibe inside  i look forward to trying more of the menu","5483":"i walked into coffeebar reno to celebrate their one year anniversary 1192015 today and was happily greeted with 1 drinks i appreciate the locality that this coffee shop provides the employees were excited to celebrate the anniversary and the ambiance of the coffee shop was great   one thing that i absolutely loved about this coffee shop was that it was spacious enough to get a lot done visit for a long time and i didnt leave the place smelling like stale coffee i assume everyone has experienced that terrible smell on their clothes after leaving a coffee place after working or chatting for many hours   the outdoor and indoor seating options were excellent and the overall experience at coffeebar reno was pretty great i ordered the dirty chai latte  which usually i love however this one left me kind of confused i think they use more chai than im used to regardless coffeebar reno knows quality coffee friendly service and they certainly know how to froth their milk the right way   i will definitely be supporting this local business again soon","5484":"mighty good chocolate mint chocolate and red velvet cupcakes and chocolate peanut butter pie thats all we had on first trip but plan to return to try many more treats","5485":"this place is delicious  i had a traditional margarita while my mom had the carriage house margarita  both were deliciouswe started out with the barbacoa empanadas and the cauliflower shishito which were both delicious  my mom had the pork pastor and i had the octopus  all of the food is delicious creative and the presentation is beautiful    our server was on it  he really knew the dishes and gave accurate descriptions and recommendations based on what we mentioned liking    i also loved the ambiance here  the cunningham restaurant group does a fantastic job with this  my only semicomplaint is that the dishes are quite small for the price you pay  with that said it still wouldnt stop me from coming back","5490":"i came here for breakfast with my man and it was pretty good it is a little weird because it is attached to maggianos however the building is so nice we ordered to bacon egg and cheese paninis chocolate chip cookies and orange juice a little bit on the pricy side it was 17 for everything however it was very good","5493":"my amazing race try out partner and i had one of our regular lunches here on a sunny saturday this is a rather exciting place to have to lunch lots of nice comfortable couches with popartearthy combo yes i know it sounds strange  you have to see it to believe it ultimately it makes it a really relaxing place to sit down and have a cat with friends or if you are on a studio binge you can go to the benches and get your study down with the vandy and belmont kids   food wise its creative sandwichs not just your typical bland stuff with unique names they are really well made with a unique flavor in it of itself and served in a very interesting dish they are a bit pricey from what you expect of a sandwich place a 1250 for sandwich and chips  the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that parking can be a nightmare you park up in this gravel lot that you pay 2 dollars for 2 hours the parking vending machine is also rather annoying you have been warned  oh and alsostrangely the bathroom is build into this old bank vault style entrance i felt like i was in the movie oceans 11 the original frank sinatra one going to the bathroom","5496":"went in for brunch with a friend and loved it  they have a rather impressive menu for a coffee shop  their offer generous but not outrageous portions and the food is freshly prepared  the pesto potatoes are fabulous  one of the highlights of my breakfast was the lemon curd that accompanied the scone that came with my meala fantastic little treat  im not a huge coffee drinker so i ordered a cafe au lait which was good but nothing special  i am willing to shell out  for good freshly prepared food  my meal came to about 12 which i think is a fair price","5500":"a good quick healthy sit down fast foods sit down restaurant for the family   i tried all their asian food here like  japanese pan noodles indonesian peanut saut\u00e9 this was goodi also tried their pad thai too it wasnt  bad at all ","5502":"stopped in for a quick lunch order a chicken veggie wrap  my wife ordered a salad  at the risk of being redundant it was so fresh  i thought it was a little pricey until the order came going to have to eat chicken wrap for dinner too help was attentive and polite a good value i will come back","5503":"my wife and i were looking to get some take out mexican and we remembered pablanos was right around the corner from our new condo so we stopped by we couldnt be more pleased at the quality of the good and friendly service   everything was fresh and tasty zero complaints well be back","5505":"i love the atmosphere here theyve got booths high tables televisions a huge pizza oven and an overall good vibe   i was simple and ordered a garden salad and spaghettic with meatballs i was actually carbing up for a race the next day and didnt want to over so iti asked the waiter to please place half of the order in a togo box which he gladly agreed toso great  my dad ordered the pesto chicken pasta which he swallowed up mom got the chinese chicken salad which she loved they dont serve garlic bread with pasta orderssomething most pizzapasta places do but i didnt mind  recommend going here and seeing what theyve got to offer","5506":"they have a lot of ice cream options along with milkshakes candy and snow cones their ice cream is very good and rich along with their milkshakes although their snow cones are too icy and it is like you are eating ice with syrup at the bottom they also have a pretty good amount of candy the place is a little run down but that is what give the place character it would also be nice if they added some music","5507":"loove the iced coffee especially from 26 when they are 99 cents dont usually get much else besides donuts which are good of course","5511":"ordered a cake for a birthday i chose a 10 round half n half cake which serves has about 20 servings i ordered it about 5 days in advanced the cake turned out perfectly and was ready when requested it was moist soft and full of flavor the buttercream was also well donenot too sweet and just right the shaved chocolate on the sides was also a nice touch   they carry the 7 cakes on hand and some of the 9 as well so if thats the size you want you can pick up right then and there while i ordered a cake i couldnt help but grab a chocolate peanut butter cupcake for the road it was great the lip of the cupcake was chewy similarly to the ends of a brownie so good   the staff was also personable they made sure to ask if i needed any help answered any questions i had and ensured i got what i wanted   they also have a counter in the window so if you grab a sweet you can eat it right there highly recommended bakery i will definitely be back","5513":"we decided to drive up from st pete to see tarpon springs for ourselves we got the assorted appetizer that had humus tzasiki and feta dip with pita bread it was 10 but there was so much my wife and i didnt finish it the taste was excellent on all three i also had the dolmades which were delicious as well   the only draw back was our waiter we went the day that greece played costa rica in the world cup when we walked in it had just gone to penalty kicks and he was in a good mood when he came back greece had lost and you could tell his demeanor had completely changed","5516":"since writing the first review of moons i have been contacted by management of the establishment they have been very courteous and helpful in regards to working things out in a way beneficial to all involved and taking steps to assure my experience is not repeated by anyone else the management clearly cares deeply about the business and its reputation at this time i have to say especially if you are like me and must have vegetarian options moons is a great option in boise i believe future service will be friendly and timely","5518":"go here all the time for the chicken carbonara people are always nice and the food is good ordered the new pesto chicken pasta bowlthis time seemed a bit light on the chicken and it is a bit pricey","5521":"great ice cream love their whipped topping and hot fudge every sandwich is wonderful my favorite is the mixed salad sandwich sometimes their soup of the day is excellent but not a fan of their everyday soups","5523":"they serve good food at affordable prices and have great customer service my favorite is their breakfast menu","5525":"oooo ya i love buying mass amounts of bulk candy like soooooo much nothing makes a great party better then vases full of jelly belly jelly beans or gummy worms or any relevant candy for the theme at hand and i have yet to come across a party theme that i can not pair with corresponding candy name your party i will tell you a candy to match and besides awesome candies they have really cheap prices on baking needs like melting chocolate food colouring sprinkles as well as nuts honey jams even vitamins the staff is super friendly they have a parking lot right out front yup i love this place","5527":"i love the taste and texture of their tuscan veggie pizza with added pepperoni the thin crust is yummy the veggies are cut perfectly well and the tomato nice and thin mmmmy only criticism is that my 2 boys and i can eat a large pizza and still be hungry if my husband was with us wed really need to order two larges and probably a salad too  in order to feel satiated maybe next time well order the thicker crust to fill us up more but the thin does taste so good we had a really sweet waitress toodidnt catch her name but she was the only female when we were there tonight","5530":"quick place to come on my lunch break pizza is good slices are an average size nothing special quick service 1 slice  a soda  353","5534":"its quite simple actually you get a made to order fresh burger with fries from a group of enthusiastic  employees the burgers are cooked well done which is great and you must specify if you want the small or regular small is a single 14 burger and regular is the double two patties the fries are yummy too but just a bit too much salt for my taste  overall if you want a fresh burger this place is worth every dime expect a 810 tab depending on if you order a drink and the wait isnt that bad either 1012 minutes on busy lunch hours","5536":"last night yelp had an event that paired mini cupcakes from batch with a few beers from their neighbor sixfour growlers  the cupcakes were delicious  the flavor combinations were very good and i dont know if it was the addition of beer in the cupcakes but they were moist and very flavorful  this is just one of the many things i love about yelp events the chance to try something new or a chance to rethink a place you may have not enjoyed the first time","5538":"my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in philly its unpretentious and delicious only complaint is the margarita mix they use is ehhh at best but considering they allow you to byo its not the worst in the world salsa and chips are great appetizers satisfactory but the strength is in their dinner entrees","5543":"enjoyed the lunch and experience   chowderbread bowl onion rings and all crab plates solid dining time  2030 min wait for lunch no issues takeout options on south side of restaurant  step back in time well be back","5545":"good atmosphere when we came in and the food inside the glass shelves seemed delicious i ordered the iced latte matcha and the breakfast calzone   we thought we had our food but the girl ended up serving us the wrong one and we had to talk to another waitress that it was wrong the waitress did come back for the wrong order haha it was cute but overall a good experience","5546":"i was pleasantly surprised by this byob on river road  this was my dinner after attending the phillips mill photography reception so we were in the last seating and sated with hors doeuvres from the earlier party  despite the fact that we were just having entrees the staff was attentive and polite though when we changed our minds about having bread we never saw it   the food was quite good since i had been served the worst scampi imaginable when dining at another restaurant with the same diner i ordered the fruitti da mare on a lark it was beautifully prepared spicy with well cooked pasta and tasty seafood i missed the bread mainly because i wanted to sop that delicious sauce   too many continental restaurants put innovation first at the expense of providing competently prepared renditions of the classics they are classics for a reason and on a chilly winter night in the country a hearty and tasty meal is appreciated   prices may be a touch high but portions were ample and since i enjoy wine with a meal bringing my own bottle and avoiding the markup more than made up for it remember  its not a bargain if the food is bad  if i am up in this neck of the river again i will definitely stop in","5549":"always delicious and healthy food overpriced but thats how it goes with the health food trend unfortunately their dressings are to die for unfortunately and the reason for removing a star the past few times that ive gone theyve been out of one or more ingredients that are crucial for my order","5551":"tucked away on dryades uptown this place is freaking cute as a button the staff greeted us and proved very friendly we had a late dinner of panini and salad 10 bucks for a sandwich well fresh mozzarella pesto and ripe tomatoes is worth it plus you get a decent fresh ensalada too fresh is key here i would have liked a bit more prosciutto on my sandwich to balance the cheese but otherwise delicious and great atmosphere","5552":"i love this little place im not sure what they do with chicken but it is magical i often come in and order the biggie size of salsa i wouldnt order a gallon of that salsa if it wasnt great and if i wasnt willing to pay for it the stuff is really that good the tacos are all freshly made and the contents are sure to leave you wanting more i honestly think this place could totally monster truck over the taco bus any day the ambiance reminds me a little of a voodoo shack out in the middle of nowhere but in a good cozy way the seating out back is beautiful on a breezy night i feel the price is right   i have noticed that some evenings when i go they are really busy and for some reason the ordering system takes a long time so i wait for a bit too long however im assured it is just growing pains and it will pass im patient and will wait for this good food highly recommend you need to go","5553":"delicious i had heard so much about pk that after moving to the neighborhood months ago i finally decided that enough was enough  i had to try this place again all that comes to mind immediately is  delicious i had the pork chop with brussel sprout leaves lentils huge chunks of bacon apple and a side of applesauce  the perfect combination of sweet salty fruit and butter the pork chop was also perfectly cooked and amazingly tender   i finished the meal off with the chocolate mousse with a layer of graham cracker and cherries on top and on the bottom seriously felt like i was eating the most heavenly brownie batter in existence this mousse was thick yet velvety super smooth and really rich i was thoroughly stuffed after only a few bites but i couldnt stop eating it  it was so good   while its true prices are a little high 26 for my entree and 7 for dessert my friend and i were allowed to savor each moment and each bite we never felt rushed even though it was a friday night and the place was packed servers were incredibly attentive and subtle and our waitress was funny and let us set our pace great night great meal i will definitely be back for more","5554":"the burgers are tasty greasy and cooked perfectly plus they come in an array of fashions and the beer is cold what more can you ask for","5556":"the new and improved great nig window views bright and friendly the place for burgers too","5559":"as a transplant from southern california its important for me to find some good ethnic cuisine i checked a website that has a bunch of different kinds of ethnic foods around indy httpwwwindyethnicfoodcom    this place was definitely a good find the parking lot is a bit shady but thats to be expected in that area of indy the decor in the restaurant was really nice and inviting  the service was very quick as well i got the pho which was very good although the broth was a bit stronger in terms of a meaty taste that i wasnt used to  however the overall taste was still delicious  the spring rolls were also good although definitely not great   price was moderate you arent going to break the bank but its not super cheap either    overall i would recommend it to people who have never had vietnamese food specifically pho and for people who want to find a good vietnamese place in indy","5560":"we first found this place because we were looking for places that have outside seating and bgood happens to have one when i explored the menu i was intrigued and excited to try it because im all for the freshest food and any place that uses local produce is a for me i just loved all their fresh juices if youre a soda person this is not the place for you although they do have their own carbinated drink like the orange mango juice food wise i tried their turkey burger in goomba style and it was delish it was the perfect size too my husband tried their beef burger in el gaupo and it also was delicious not over seasoned it was a pretty straight forward dish i was also able to take a bite of their veggie burger which caused the 4star for me it was quite bland and not all veggie burger is bland i will still recommend this for a quick simple and guilt free meal","5561":"love this little gem  great place for gifts for those who have everything i bought the popcorn flavoring giftbox for my dad along with the steak and chops seasoning gift boxes for my boyfriends father great variety of every spice imaginable  and you can try everything","5562":"i love this place the bread is really good all i ever get here is bread and tomato piereally good the tomato pie is honestly some of the best i have ever had   that said i do have one complaint the bakery is supposed to be open until four pm but it never is and if they sell out everyday by noon instead of making more bread they next day to accommodate more customers they just sell out at noon again i call at 1pm all the time and they almost never pick up often they are already closed  anyway they bake good bread but getting it is often much more annoyingdifficult than it should be","5563":"as a south indian i was excited to see a place that served dosa and sambar the sambar was pretty well made the dosa could have been crispier but still tasted great and was large and well worth the money i got a dosa with potatoes masalaa dosa but you can egg or cheese as well i also got it extra spicy which gives it a great kick   i samples some of the entree dishes they were all flavorful and spicy ill have to come back to try them as a meal  the only negative i would have would be that the samosa was not wellmade its a potato and green peafilled fried appetizer the dough shell was hard and it wasnt as good as the other food i had  great service too","5565":"i went here the other day and its such a cute place super light and bright with cute artwork and such the only thing that bothered me a bit is that i felt kind of uncomfortable being therereason being the people working behind the counter seemed annoyed or tired or something maybe because i only bought two things but i had the feeling they were waiting for me to leave if that makes sense it couldve been an off day or i read them wrong so the four stars is for the product its hard to find delicious vegan desserts but this place has them i kind of wish they had more rather than what seemed to be 75 regular and 25 vegan but i know its a niche market i really enjoyed my raspberry cookie i dont remember the exact name and healthy cookie 5 stars for bothi liked them both in different ways the raspberry i think it was a thumbprint cookie was crumbly and full of nuts and some oats and didnt taste vegan not too much raspberry goo which i appreciated the healthy cookie is full of oats coconut and chocolate and was so divine ill have to try an ice pop next time and maybe bring some friends","5567":"we had an early dinner so i cant rate the ambience since we were the only people there however it looks like they have a busy delivery service the place was clean the service was attentive and fast we ordered the fried calamari two souvlaki platters one lamb one chicken they are fairly priced 1114 a platter came with greek salad tzaziki sauce pita and 3 skewers of choice of protein pita tasted fresh meat was marinated and seasoned really well only thing was the platter came with french fries not something i expect to see at an authentic greek place i would have preferred rice but my one year old prefers fries over anything else so it worked out we will be back to try other things on the menu","5568":"great food great beer and a wide variety of vegetarian choices i love that there is a place in broad ripple where i can get a garden veggie sloppy joe   they consistently have slow service but ive come to terms with that and am more than willing to accept it as long as they continue to serve great food and beer","5570":"thank god they got rid of who ever was killing the food its back to a wonderful experience and great food thanks for fixing whatever was broken ","5572":"really enjoyed my first experience here but definitely think they are still working out their kitchen kinks  the beers as always were delicious  we had the fried chicken and loved it  the desserts were good as well  a few of the other items that we sampled though were kind of meh so i definitely think they are still figuring out what direction they want to go  i will definitely be back because i love the layout and the openness of the space and of course the beer  i love their smaller bar as well but find that at times the staff can be a bit stuffy or dismissive  that was not the case here at all and i definitely appreciated that","5577":"i absolutely love this place the staff is really friendly and offers free samples right away  they have a rotating menu of flavors but you can always see updates from their facebook page of flavors that are offered i love the toppings they offer the fruity boba and also the mochi  its always pure joy coming here","5580":"great service very attentive even though they were busy i love the duck dish","5582":"i finally made it to innout now thats a burger i got a double double with fries why oh why cant we have an innout in boston its just not fair ive been craving that super cheesy yumminess since i got back from vacation i already know that when i go back to cali innout will be one of my first stops","5588":"i had my first pho experience circa 2005 in saigon when it was truly a hole in the wall off lafayette rd we ate there a few more times before moving away in 2007   a few states many bowls of pho and what felt like a lifetime later we found ourselves in saigons current and expanded location one gloomy sunday night driven there by a mix of nostalgia and curiosity while in town taking care of some business   i wasnt sure if its still owned by the same family but upon entrance i recognized the vietnamese guy who used to run the dining room all by himself and he greeted us as if he recognized us too a few sentences later i believed he did remember us from almost 7 years ago as much as i like to think me and my guy make an unforgettable couple its more likely he is uncannily unforgetful  i wasnt in the mood for an 8dollar bowl of pho it costs around 67 in our hood so we went with bun bi thit nuong 90 it had the succulent vietnamese grilled pork we love in fact some of the best though i could do without the shredded pork for spring rolls you cant go wrong with the same grilled pork and the clear dipping sauce they serve much better than the thick peanut sauce served in some vietnamese places imo fried fish cakes were not bad especially drown in the sweet chili sauce   to my disappointment they dont serve salted plum drink so i got a bubble tea in thai tea flavor i wish i had ordered one made from fresh fruits since it wasnt the brewed thai tea in liquid form i expected but a mountain of blended ice and thai tea flavored powders hate those the tapioca balls werent good either   on that sunday night the former bob evans dining room was half full but less than one third of the patrons were asians quite a change from years ago at the old location if memory serves me right i guess vietnamese food has finally caught on in indy  still closed on tuesdays after all these years","5591":"love this place great chinese and japanese takeout  it is consistent  reasonably priced  food quality very good and fast for take out","5593":"they do live up to their name deviate by making brews with flavors that departs from the more institutionaltraditional beer taste the night we went they have beers with flavors like cucumber chipotle cinnamon green peppercorn raspberry and coconut and im not talking like just hint of flavor or a mild after taste its a quite strong and in your face flavor sip after sip the more conventional beer drinkers might not like it or find some of the beer taste weird but it can be fun and you gotta appreciate what they are doing and i think that makes them unique and special and an excellent addition to the list of breweries in the indy area and certainly worth a try definitely the place to visit for the more adventurous beer drinkers  the staff were very friendly they serve beer flight which is a great start so you can try most if not all and then decide which you like the best no food but there were free pretzel sticks and water and i think they allow order in or even bring your own food","5596":"wait here for lunch during the week between christmas and new years with 6 elementary age girl scouts   nonwait great service and the server named nico was very patient with the 6 scouts answering questions bringing extra sauces etc  all 6 scouts had ice cream and proclaimed baileys range to be their new favorite place  this moms burger was delicious too  thx","5597":"this is a good dunkin donuts because they have very friendly employees and a great selection of munchkins so you can get what varieties you want the bad thing is that the area is frequented by a lot of drug addicts and hookers once i almost stepped on a needle in the parking lotgross fortunately the police headquarters are almost directly across the street so there are a lot of cops and paramedics that frequent the store so its relatively safe","5599":"sb shellfish company is a cute little restaurant at the end of the pier that offers both inside and outside seating  when we arrived saturday afternoon the waiting list was 3 pages long thankfully it moved quickly and was well worth the wait  the staff was very friendly and helpful in deciding what wonderful items on the menu we should order thanks sean  we ordered chowder crab cocktail  fried calamari  each entree came with to die for onion rings which were incredibly light and fluffy and i could have sworn had a slight coconut flavor  yum  to complete our meals and satisfy our thirst the boys had a local beer on tap and i had a spicy bloody mary  the meal was absolutely spectacular  the only reason why i gave the restaurant 4 out of 5 stars is because the indoor seating is quite cramped i literally played elbow wars with the patrons sitting on each side of me throughout the entire meal  however the seating didnt ruin my experience and next time we are in town we will definitely be dining at sb shellfish co","5600":"i live near here so im not sure why it took me so long to discover it but im sure glad i did  everything is fresh and delicious and i feel like you just cant go wrong with what you order from here  nothing against bread co but id recommend this place about 1000 times more","5603":"wine tasting is a fabulous way to warm up a frigid sunday afternoon in jersey since it is the middle of polar vortex in nj in january i was not surprised that the outside looked barren but once inside the room is warm filled from wall to wall with wine cases and endless awarded medals   we decided to have the 9 wine tasting for 10 and had a magnificent sommelier teach us about the wine the gentleman talked to us about tones and carefully chose our tasting order we were having such a good conversation with him and the two ladies next to us that im pretty sure we were well over our 9 tastings which then of course meant more purchasing for me my favorite wine overall was the sparkling wine  spuma rossa  after warming up with the wine we were even allowed a tour of the cellar where they keep the wine aging which i thought was super cool this is an excellent place to impress a date without being too fancy  i am bummed we did not know of the live music brick oven and overall fun that takes place here at night before our tasting it looks like this is a great place where local bands showcase their talent and you can enjoy a small indoor concert with friends   overall this is definitely a place where we would return wines ranged from 12  25 a bottle so a little more than other places in area but for the great customer service it is worth the drive","5604":"olive oils and more  this  mother son team are versed not only on the quality difference in their products but also in matching specific oils vinegars and other culinary ingredients with the dishes you intend to create  understanding and sharing the alchemy that is created when selecting and matching the perfect ingredients whether oils vinegars  is where they  differentiate themselves its encouraged to slurp  oils strippaggio is the term used to describe the slurping employed by an olive oil taster after taking an oil sample into his or her mouth this technique allows a complete sensory experience of the oil compared to just sipping the oil  so slurp away at this family run business  you will also discover amazing pastas and dont forget to return your used bottles","5606":"finally made it to kanella back in march holy crap that felt like it took forever i was a fan of cheg pitsillides i hope thats close to the correct spelling dont feel like googling when he cooked at the unfortunately shortlived meze but for some reason kanella kept getting pushed lower down my eattherenow list enough of this mischief on to the food  delicious haloumi as one can expect excellent grilled sardines a semiconstant craving of mine delicious lambstuffed fried koubes yum also delicious stuffed peppers no longer on the menu maybe was a special am definitely itching to go back and try more things i completely trust this chef to deliver one of the dishes we had in march was a special and i remember it was a red meat served with a mix of braised green veg including escarole and nettles excellent and he used nettles which are a criminally underusedunderappreciated and hard to frickin find ingredient i asked our waiter to ask where the chef got his but he wouldnt tell me boo but he doesnt know that i am not a chef or a spy sigh maybe anastasios will special order some for me","5607":"ok im a slightly reluctant fan of this pf chang spinoff i have visited the parent restaurant several times but today was my first at this more casual chain  the menu is similar to what i have experienced at pfc and the prices are lower so far me likey how could i not try the lettuce wraps im obsessed with them and order at almost anyplace that i encounter them here there are 2 versions i opted for the thai and it was good but not great but kudos to them for providing enough lettuce to eat them with next time ill the original version   a few entrees looked enticing but in keeping with a thaiish theme i selected dynamite chicken i liked this a lot crunchy chicken pieces that were slightly spicy the veggie pasty of the dish was sparse mucho scallion but just some shredded carrots and red pepper sauce was almost non existent trish ordered her favorite here chicken pad thai i tasted and thought it was ok not quite what the dish can be in a good thai shop but for the price and quickness very acceptable  they offer a good rewards program that probably helps bring back repeat customers at our early lunch arrival we noticed that the place filled in quickly this is a good choice for a fast and filling meal at a reasonable price 4 why do i feel slightly guilty yelps","5608":"good stuff  small brewery but you can tell that mike and mike really care about the beer plus the vats look like big silver minions  p","5610":"another location of bings boba loated in the lee lees market plaza  during summer shaved ice was only 175 for the small small lychee flavored shaved ice yummy and refreshing in the 100plus degree weather  they have a large selection of toppings for boba drinks that ill have to come back to try  note stamp card for regulars","5611":"excellent selection of meat and great quality a little pricey but you get what you pay for here the southwest tritip sandwich is amazing and they have a wide variety of rare meats","5612":"tiny little place off of williams nearly right behind french press coffeehouse   they offer some sandwiches and baked goods as well as some groceries  lets just say ive been to normas 3 times the past month since ive rediscovered it  the cuban sandwich is worthy of a return yes but what keeps me coming back is the flan oh my god its absolutely delicious have not tried many other of the baked goods but i am looking forward to doing so in the future if i can stray away from the flan that isthe staff is always very friendly when you walk in there and every time ive been there are locals hanging out on the porch people watching or enjoying a snack very reasonably priced","5613":"the wait is long and it is crowded even late at night i came in past 8 and waited over 30 minutes for a seat when it was cold and windy out i would give it 5 stars if not for that seat the rock crab is worth it however fresh and sweet with caesar salad and a cup of hot lobster bisque on the side the crab cakes are ok and so was the shrimp and scallop pasta  the server was friendly fast and helpful she substituted the regular soup for  the bisque 5 stars for her a little pricey but a nice place for fresh simple seafood fare","5614":"whenever i visit my friend is s phila i go here i always go for the lemon then i leave my friends house and go back for seconds","5615":"really cute cozy place the chocolate gelato was good and it was nice enough to sit on the back patio the gal at the counter wasnt exactly friendly which was awkward i appreciate the bin for the plastic cups and spoons to recycle them","5619":"weve eaten here four times and have really enjoyed the food the service the ambience and the great french 75s  it is really far for us but good enough that we keep working on excuses to drive to this end of town coming up with one right now","5620":"just opened so staff not fully trained although it was busy and they lost my pizza it was surprisingly good will return when they get the kinks out a good addition and value to renos marginal pizza offerings","5621":"the wife and i stopped in at cyranos for a late night drink and snack  although it was a pretty ugly night the place was hopping  we sat at a pub table back by the coffee bar and they were seriously cranking out some hot drinks and lots of whipped cream   the biggest question about cyranos is what the hell is it  when you drive by and even when you walk in you get the feeling your in a trendy upscale restaurant  then they hand you a menu and on its owne it looks like you might be at a waffle house or something  very casual looking  upon closer inspection though there are not a ton of items but they are definitely way too interesting to be at any kind of chain restaurant  there is also a pretty extensive menu for coffee drinks and desserts which we just ignored and a pretty decent wine list  the bar looks like a counter almost as if they are embarrassed to have a full bar  the ambience while having an upscale appearance is still very lively   we werent sure if it was the acoustics or what but this was a very loud crowd   for anyone who has been to the benton park cafe cryanos is what they are trying to be and doing a much better job of it   we had a couple glasses of wine by the glass and spinachartichoke dip  all was very good   we wont hesistate to come back for a date sometime and try the main courses  if it was more convenient i have a feeling we might become regulars  cool place  give it a try","5622":"as a girl scout daisy mom i thoroughly enjoyed seeing gs cookies crafted into their full potential alcoholic beverages seriously i would probably buy more cookies from my daughter if i knew how to make drinks out of them   with all of the bites of food  drinks made out of the cookies i kind of felt like i was on the verge of a diabetic coma by the end of it but everything was so good  i did feel like the event itself was a little slow im not sure if thats the right word there just wasnt much to do after making our way around to all of the sampling stations besides sit chat and enjoy the band we left pretty early on as enjoyable as the band was  and they had a great singer  theres only so much sitting around that i can do especially while my stomach was full of sugar   still this was a great opportunity for an evening out i got to sample some great items and they had a nice silent auction","5623":"a great home greek experience with good food and great atmosphere by the sponge docks of tarpon springs  to get the greek experience you must get their feta flamed flambeed with the ouzo  opa","5625":"warning no longer serving brunch as of 81416 host said they stopped serving brunch eight months ago a great place for lunch and dinner","5626":"came in with my fianc\u00e9 for a drink and a snack i ordered a frozen white chocolate almond shiver drink and it was so good my fianc\u00e9 got an iced tea which she also enjoyed  we shared a spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips  it was served hot and bubbly with melted cheese and big chunks of artichoke  it was quite tasty  the place is cute and was pretty steadily busy the entire time we were there","5628":"introduced to this by a friend and fell in love with it i always make it a point to try something different each time here especially the donuts i dont normally have a sweet tooth but this place changes it for menomnation","5629":"closest and still far froyo place move closer please  expensive delicious diy individualized tantalizing fun trendy and easy not as healthy as they make it out to be but oh well ill work it off later","5631":"montecito is a small town i mean its not perryville arkansas but a small town none the less elegant ritzy privileged conservative might be words to describe this slightly hidden onclave  so walking into tre lune restaurant it represented its atypical demographic very nicelyas it should  the bar in the back makes generous strong drinks their wine list is well thought out the service is very respectful and the food is real good pretty much everything i just mentioned is what a montecito local would want and expect in their environment   my caesar salad was very good my meatballs and spaghetti was great my friends pasta bolognese was equally delicious our wives shared a branzino which they loved and our chosen caberet was excellent all done in a somewhat upper class casual way that might sound snooty but it wasnt i mean that in a good way  tre lune was a very nice dinner in this very nice small town where there are very nice people","5633":"what do you do when you are extremely hungry locked inside of a venue and there is a food truck you walk up to that food truck and you order the giant hot dog and you inhale it this food truck is new orleans and thats why i needed to give it a try  the hot dog was massive and since im a boring person i got mine plain theres not much to say about a food truck the staff was nice and the food was delicious give it a try","5635":"great customer service they let us bring our large pomeranian up on the patio with us where he stayed tucked away under our chairs  they even brought a bowl of water out for him  our food was really good the price is reasonable 20 for two for sit down cafe food","5638":"this was a really nice restaurant i like the design the lady who took our order was really nice and friendly and offered me a better deal on the item i ordered when they called my name i got up to go to the counter but the guy was already coming to me that was a nice touch sadly they forgot one of my items in the deal i chose but i didnt realize until i long after i had eaten on the way home ha i did dinein and it was a pleasant experience the restaurant was clean and tidy which is always a good thing lol ill definitely come back sometime","5641":"i dont know if its actually that much cheaper than places on the hill it has a bit less atmosphere but it is very good food   dont me wrong if you brought an italian here they might be highly offended even as an american the sauces and cheese are not what ive experienced in any other city st louis has to be the only place on earth that does italian this way it is more than just provel cheese that is different   that is so interesting though and on a budget with kids or on their monday all you can eat deal you might want to come to pasta house   we had excellent service at this location a deal from groupon and a quite tasty meal i wish they still gave slu basketball discounts and after this season they just might they sure wouldnt have to give them often as slu may not score 60 points often   a local chain that makes st louis italian well not everybody in the metro can always eat on the hill my fianc\u00e9 has loved the tortellini all her life its hard to try anything else after youve tried it","5642":"cute little coffee place i got an iced coffee with pumpkin spice and almond milk i rally liked it the bf got an americano and said it was okay","5645":"beautiful day dined outside service was very good but a little slow we both ordered the ellen salad a real winner shrimp scallops and salmon cooked to perfection and served on a bed of sauteed arugula  highly recommend","5646":"aside from the small space and limited seating theres little to complain about this place located at the end of stearns wharf this is my goto place for good chowder and fresh seafood when im in santa barbara their specials are a tad on the pricier sidebut the quality and freshness makes i worth your while my boyfriend and i ordered a bowl of soup and the shrimp scampi the scampi came on top of seasoned white rice and unlike some other places the scampi wasnt greasy","5651":"last day in nashville so we had to walk over to the pancake pantry    it was raining out and we arrived around 820am and the wait was about 20 minutes   not too bad  once we arrived the line was more than double after 5 minutes so we had good timingand the rain stopped after 10 minutes so all was going well  a guy came out as we got close to the door and asked people how many in your party  there is a small vestibule you can sit in right before they come out and get you when your table is ready   we ordered the medley with pancakes cherry pancakes and kids pancakes with chocolate chips  they ask if you want the trimmings on the kids pancakes since they cut them into the shape of stars    the wait for the food was about 20 minuteswhich was a bit surprising considering we ordered almost right away and got out food after another table of 4 got their food first arriving after us    we all enjoyed our food but the pancakes had a bit too much baking powder flavor to fluff up the pancakes  overall it was a good visit and would go again the prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly","5653":"seminole hard rock casino is a great entertainment venue best times vary according to your own luck i enjoy the food and drinks while im there frequently ive been invited to a jackpot party even months after the original jackpot win gambeling isnt as addictive as one my think with some good critical thinking and the right selection of games for example baccarat or roulette you could certainly leave a winner and revisit with better enthusiasm  i also enjoy some good perks as an elite member along with charity tournaments so dont listen so much to all the sour comments get out there and create your own energy  life is

meritage  not too impressive  they are new so i will go back  right near the speedway","5656":"ive been here more times than i can count their beef lo mein is my favorite great crab rangoons fast and friendly i usually order on my way to pick it up and its ready by the time i get there 8 minutes later","5660":"i love mexican food and i think that is one thing the st louis area lacks  good mexican food my husband and i tried this place for the first time last night and felt very satisfied im a chips and salsa snob and have to say this place has the best chips and salsa around warm chips and delicious nottoospicy salsa we also ordered the chorizo dip which was divine my husband ordered the steak and chicken combo fajitasthey were great i ordered the steak fajita chimiit was okay i didnt care for the beans and was a little disappointed about that because i usually love the side of beans i also had a medium margarita which was a little strong  but good we had an awesome waiter who was attentive and friendly   someone wrote a review on here about getting the groupon which we did and im so grateful for that at the time i purchased the groupon  it was 28 for 45 worth of food great deal with all the food we ordered chorizo dip medium margarita fajita chimi  and steakchicken fajita our check was 4530 but of course i just paid 28 using my groupon if you do purchase a groupon  make sure it is for the right location  they will check  also i dont think the groupon can be used for tip so have extra  for your server","5663":"this is a hidden gem off maryland way food is good daily specials certainly are attractive burger  fries 699 75 wings 699 philly cheese etc service is always friendly but sometimes slow","5664":"pretty good place for dinner with lots of selection and variety their sushi offerings are pretty extensive and the quality is not bad they also have hot pot available soft tofu though i heard its not so great and lots of hot dishes the fried chicken wings are great  wouldnt mind checking it out again sometime","5670":"loved the food drinks and ambiance very good service too tableside guacamole is outstanding  salsa different and delish sauces were wonderful as well will visit again","5672":"i love dierbergs after moving to the city of st louis i was dissappointed there were no dierbergs within the city limits this is the closest one i think to my place i really like their deli they have the best cooked meals meats deli items etc the store is always clean and staff is very helpful also love the little directories on the side of each isle","5676":"this is one of the nicer and cleaner mcdonalds i have been to  they even had a couple of touch screens that allow you to order and skip the normal line   the bathrooms and seating area is clean  they also still have hazelnut iced coffee which some locations have discontinued  the only thing is that the cinnamelts we ordered for breakfast were kind of dry and not very warm ","5678":"this is really good food ive had better in new york city but this is really tasty i got the combo meat salad hard to beat five bucks for dinner","5679":"chop stix is like a mini pf changssimilar food and quality nice atmosphere great servers food comes out fast the happy hour from 35pm is awesome great appetizer prices and adult beverages as of this review local hotel guests receive a discount the servers and cooks are very open about changing up the menu for your dish the food is really good","5680":"went here a couple of weeks ago  i had the butchers chilifreaking awesome  my husband had onion porter soupwinner  we shared reek donkey fish spreadfantastic  wish this place was closer to lakeland  loved it","5681":"as a nonmeat eater the menu is not the most friendly in the world but i dont even care dining on a friday meant the veggie lasagna was the special and it a perfect amount for two we added a salad and it was plenty  the cocktailsoh myjust incredible   only one small thumbsdown the pretzel cone  sounds delicious right well perhaps we had a bad batch but ours was hard verrry salty and i love salt and overall not delicious   a lovely date spot as well ","5682":"so this restaurant is in a colorful area of town full of lovely ethnic restaurants first thing love that they have their own parking lot on a chilly day it is nice to park close the  food is delicious tasty fresh dumplings that can be boiled steamed or pan fried with a variety of fillings they did not have the lamb with dill so we ordered chicken with curry dumplings lamb with coriander and beef with tomatoes as well as the fresh noodles splashed with chili oil all were delicious however the lamb with coriander were our favourite  huge portions delicious fresh and flavourful and a very kind server however it was slightly run down on the inside and both of us found it very cold inside two things that could use some improvement but for the price quality and quantity of food we will definitely be back to try other flavours they also have a take outpick up option  which would take care of the atmosphere try it i dont think you will be disappointed","5683":"thoroughly enjoyed it chicken biriyani had boneless meat which is always nice spice level was just above mild chicken tikka masala had a nice warm flavor the garlic naan was just ok  didnt taste fresh but if you dunk it in sauce its just fine","5684":"while the line was quite long about 45 minutes to an hour we werent disappointed once we finally got in and seated the pecan pancakes were amazing not overly sweet and the chopped pecans in the syrup that was brought with the dish added a nice crunch the hash browns were crispy and fresh and the bacon was perfectly cooked the sweet potato pancakes were equally delicious complemented nicely with the cinnamon cream syrup which the boyfriend delightfully ate by the spoonful all by itself overall we were very impressed worth the wait when you have time","5688":"food is amazing beers are good prices are a big steep  the atmosphere is incredible though  absolutely love the vibe of this place","5689":"we have been 3 times and loved it every time service was great ask for david he was very helpful and knew the menu i had the asian chicken salad and husband had the burger and we loved it all other 2 visits were for the sunday brunch which is the best in town huge variety for 1695 drinks extra prime rib is awesome as well as the cheesy hash browns other choices are salad soup fruit eggs baconsausage smoked salmon waffles poached eggs omelets french toast cinnamon rolls biscuits gravy and more i recommend this place","5692":"our third or fourth time to hellas in the last few years  never disappoints  the service was great and the food was even better  its hard to go wrong on the menu but this time i went for the pork gyro  the greek salad is an absolute must  we came in with four adults and five children  they found us a spot near the back out of the way  the kids meals were reasonably priced 499 which included a drink  i highly recommend hellas if youre in or near tarpon springs  bonus  they have thier own parking lot behind the restaurant  they will validate with your meal  makes life much easier when it is busy down by the sponge docks","5693":"this is the best chinese restaurant in the greater extondowningtown area i have ordered out as well as eaten in the food is made fresh and is consistent if you dine in do not expect american level of customer service will your food come hot yes will you get a refill of water or tea after you asked maybe not do not expect any smiles as long as you have realistic expectations you will be fine and content if you are looking to feel valued as a customer i suggest trying a different restaurant with lower quality food but great smiles","5696":"great real food a little pricy friendly staff clean trendy place","5697":"the only reason i did not give this five stars is because nothing really opens at nine the doors open however everything else opens at ten i recommend doing the bud light tour you get three or four different samples and learn a lot of history and information on all the beer there are great places to take pictures throughout the tour the gift shop is amazing however it is very very very expensive id go just for the experience and buy the gifts on amazon","5698":"my goto spot for a buffalo chicken slice  always consistent excellent meat and flavor on their pizzas too  their salads and wraps are a little bit on the expensive side but also good  overall highly recommended  definitely the best takeout spot in east falls","5699":"the only reason that i dont give them five stars is one particular donut i made the mistake of eating a lemonfilled okay so far chocolate iced donut one time ewwwother than that theyre awesome","5700":"excellent veggie burger and truffle fries try the fried mac and cheese bites too","5701":"excellent food and service started on the mules list and enjoyed 56 of them stay away from the caribbean seahorse as after the first sip its reminiscent of being on a bad cruise with the aftertaste of elmers glue lingering on your breath there are some drinks that should not be altered from their original state and the moscow mule is a classics not to be bastardized","5702":"im a repeat customer to this particular rallys branch the food is great the customer service is good when you can get their attention if you dont mind being the only person in their waiting area  just standing there suggestion to  rallys  add some chairs to your waiting area in case one of your customers wants to sit down while waiting for their food for 1520 min to get your food","5704":"i got the falafel pita and it was absolutely delicious the pita it came in was fantastic and there was just enough substance to the pitasandwich to get everything in one bite which i thoroughly enjoyed i also got the grape leaves to split with a friend and in my opinion i would say those were just okay i only had grape leaves for the first time about a week ago at a different restaurant and i thought they were amazing however after getting them here i dont feel the same maybe i just dont know what flavors to expect in a traditional grape leaf i can only say i enjoyed them a lot more at a different location either way i will absolutely be back honestly great wholesome food for a really competitive price thanks smiley","5705":"have walked by this place a million times and finally said why not the wait staff was really nice the hostess not so much built my own burger and it was actually really really great the side pickles was awesome sadly the fries and onion rings were just meh kinda was hoping for a little better there only complaints were the ketchup and soda were both some all natural gross version of themselves ketchup should be heinz  no exceptions there  priced as a casual dining restaurant","5709":"the restaurant itself is pretty small with very limited seating it too us about 15 minutes to get a table for two for saturday lunch tons of people here so service is a little slow  which is understandable  i ordered the calamari sandwich and it was cooked to perfection my friend got the ceviche and she really liked that too servers were really nice","5711":"food is consistently good reasonably priced and all entrees offered all day very friendly waitresses now open for breakfast and lunch 6am  3 pm no longer open until 800 pm all menu items offered open till close perfect when i want lunch and hubby wants breakfast  weve been coming here since they opened in chapel hill for months we were here every saturday so trust me were put them to the test then the waistline issues so visits have slowed down couple times in the past bad service and overcooked food but overall we always enjoy the service and food at this location other locations are at your own riskespecially zionsville  they appear to have a lot of teen bussers who stand around waiting for tables to empty or working inefficiently during rush hours hand them a coffee pot or help run food and drinks very frustating when your coffee cup is empty and everyone swamped except the busser just standing there watching  large variety for everyone  breakfast burgers sandwiches panini greek home style manhattans or even liver  onions and now a healthy menu with calorie count offered beware the warning at bottom of healthy menu calorie count is half order regardless its healthier options which we all appreciate  food recommendations the spinach swiss and turkey bacon omelette is exceptional and comes with fresh fruit large omelet and always one of my favorites   my other favorite is their oatmeal creamy and comes with all the toppings on the side full order is a huge bowl they also offer tiny bowl i prefer just cinnamon and touch of sub sugar delicious  monte carlo with ham  swiss on french toast comes with choice of soup salad or coleslaw if youre not watching your waist a must have always delicious and trust me you will enjoy the sandwich on their french toast omg  gyro sandwich has tender slices of gyro meat on pita with tomatoe onions and cucumber sauce tasty and would order again if hungry for gyro spinach pie with greek salad is also very popular and tasty  breakfast options i speak from friends comments french toast is the best in the world must order monte carlo experience told me hes right even though ive never had a full breakfast order   pancakes are good not exceptional would order again if you love pancake toppings know that their topping is pie filling some loveso im not hating just warning fresh fruit option needed even if they had to rasie the prices slightly   last but not least my friend loves the liver  onions this being his third time ordering he enjoys the way its cooked then smothered with sautee onions his 2 side choices are mashed potatoes and corn corn rather bland and not sweet though his words are if you like liver and onions order it  something for everyone give it a try and if youre not happy speak up to the manager we have and its helped as he said it is the only way they can fix the problems","5713":"we heard a lot about this king cake burger and against my better judgment we went on an adventure to find them last sunday  first of all if youre unsure of where the truck is be sure to check their facebook page just search food drunk food truck on google and its the first hit and they update daily with where you can find them   alright so back to the burger despite there being a parade going on there was no line at the truck so it was easy in and out 10 for a king cake burger which ill admit looked fantastic gooey cheese piping hot etc  so heres my criticism man a king cake burger tastes a lot like a king cake burger i dont know what i was expecting but yup thats king cake and a burger   dont get me wrong the meat was fantastic there was tons of delicious cheese and completely separate from the burger i guess the king cake wasnt bad together though man i dont need sprinkles on my burger ok  i dont really know what could make this better for me maybe if they did some sort of sauce on the burger that married the two flavors but as is the whole thing is kind of jarring or maybe im just a boring eater who knows","5714":"recently stopped here to check the new brewery out as we arrived we found they only had 4 parking spaces and then signs that said to not park on the street next to the brewery found that odd but we luckily got one of the 4 spots in the lot walked and found the place to be decorated nicely we were greeted promptly and ordered a flight of everything they had it was a mix of sours ipas and stouts for the most part all were at or above average except on of the sours the carlton it smelled like puke skip that one i really enjoyed the industrial design of the place but hated the chairs i could not sit in them but the ladies seemed to enjoy them overall i look forward to coming back and sampling some more beers","5716":"a coffee house with an ambience of a hipster indian and casual scene  no pretentious vibe that you see with mega chains like starbucks second  cup etcthe kashmir chai was amazing i am normally dubious about the staff of these hipster coffee houses but the staff was very friendly and influenced my selection of the variety of beverages  although the food may not be fine dining experience the samosas provide adequate sustenance to tide one over until dinner","5718":"range is one of the newer additions to downtown and once again the folks behind places like baileys chocolate bar bridge and rooster hit it out of the park they are my favorite restaurateurs in the downtown stl area  even though each place is very different in niche cuisine hours decor each has the impression of being well thoughtthrough for what it is  so what range is  a modern update of the soda bar  rollerskatewearing carhop burger joints of yore no you dont pull up in your car and get served by comely ladies in skates but the food is pure americana burgers fries shakes and floats except did we mention boozy shakes and boozy floats yes i would put on my bobby socks for these  the  interior is dominated by a large barheight table that runs the length of the restaurant with stools for seating we should add there is also a barheight bar that runs the length of the restaurant parallel to the table  perhaps a bit offputting to the standard middleamerican diner who seems to prefer maintaining a certain distance from gasp other people but we found it charming came in on a superbusy friday night but nonetheless had maybe a 10 minute wait for a spot for 2 which was just right for ordering drinks at the bar  the burger menu includes many inventive takes on the classic and it seems you can substitute different kinds of patties pork chicken bison lamb veggie for the freerange cow patties if you so desire some burgers appear to be crafted around the type of meat involved so sub at your own risk we went exotic with the pbj bison with arugula pesto goat cheese and tomato jam and the smoking duck burgers  the former was just do it you will not be sad the duck was ok  nothing wrong with it but in comparison to the pbj it was a little boring you should just order two sides of fries rather than one large  costs less plus you get to try more sauces the rooster is the same spicycreamy sauce served on top of the crepes at the rooster and the homemade catsup was just fine havent tried the others yet  the big winner though is the boozy horchata milkshake an invention that should have come to be long before now you will somehow make room for it we promise  they have a fun survivorstyle competition where each week two burgers face off in a battle  the one that gets ordered more gets to stay on the menu should keep things interesting over time  great idea for nom longevity","5721":"as others have said great place to set up with your laptop or books spacious clean interior bubble tea never tasted so good","5727":"im on an atkins diet and i find the sausage and egg biscuit and the ultimate omelette biscuit at hardees to be a perfect pow carb option excluding the biscuits of course the ultimate omelette has eggs cheese sausage and bacon and it is tasty with a good consistency the sausage and egg was good not great i went through the drive up at 7 am on a wednesday morning and had a 7 minute wait from my order they were busy the lady was nice who served me oder was correct although no thank you for the order","5730":"been going here for years when it was zenas always good food now its orange blossom same feel same food love the the morning glory omelette but the pancakes are too bread like and sweet or lite and fluffy love everything else","5731":"great beer and atmosphere good food good service friendly and accommodating i would recommend and go back if you go on friday or saturday go early as it fills fast poor parking is why only 4 stars","5735":"although this is a charming little market  they have a very limited selection of items that are somewhat pricey and it is much less crowded than others  however you might want to take advantage of the outdoor terrace at the caf\u00e9 on the site great atmosphere food and coffee","5736":"first time there today the thin crust pizza was really good  loved the sauce too  the guys behind the counter were super nice the place is old and desperately in need of updating though it looks like it hasnt changed since 1984 despite the design of the place i will be back for take out","5747":"delectable a\u00e7a\u00ed bowlspita and wonderful staff ambience was quaint and clean only downside was lengthy wait time for food","5755":"we stopped by last sunday based on the quality reviews of my fellow yelpers and we enjoyed our breakfast  the apple empanadas were just coming out of the oven and the place tasted great  my wife and i shared our meals and one of the empanadas and so we left full but not stuffed as ive been known to do in the past  the one quick tip id leave you is that this is not a gussied up fancified place  its a simple place with good food a friendly attitude and nice service  well be back","5757":"watta great place to stop in passagrille  for starters they sell shave ice its the real deal even the machine was manufactured in hawaii  they pour decent coffee espresso and have ice cream and baked goodies the kids will love it  as good a place as any to stop for a treat in that area  location location location  4 stars hooray  if you dont know you betta axe somebody","5759":"absolutely fabulous fried macaroni  cheese are a must have burgers were out if this world prosciutto burger  buffalo burgers were the best ever next time were in franklin tn we will be dining here again","5760":"sid bookers is much apart of philly as cheesesteaks and soft pretzels  i just always remember them being there and the smell overtaking my senses as i approached the takeout window to place my order   the shrimp are always a consistent golden brown and the taste is delicious  the only side available is fries  makes your choices simple","5762":"my husband and i have been to cracker barrel many many times we enjoy the generous helpings and the low cost the eggs are always cooked just right their pancakes taste homemade and the syrup of course is pure maple the french toast is cooked just the way i like it crisp on the outside i like the sausage links but not the pattys they are smoked and i dont care for the flavor the grits are cooked just right and the hash browns are the best  i like the biscuits and gravy the gravy is very rich with a smokey flavor  bacon is cooked crisp but not burnt the staff is always friendly and upbeat  the price is always right would recommend","5764":"i have only ordered twice from here the first order was last week and i was very satisfied overall first up on the order was the deal and you get a one topping large pizza i paid for extra toppings and there was barely any toppings in fact the small pie of the week dixie chicken that was half off price looked and tasted better the delivery driver was friendly and fast too which was nice  the second order was last night i ordered the deal once again and my sprite tasted like alkaseltzer  it was so nasty i dumped it out and thought what a waste this time the one topping looked better than the pie of the week spring pie  was supposed to have cilantro and salsa definitely was no cilantro and very little salsa  why do ya skimp on the toppings when you charge nearly 2 per extra if i get skimped on one more time im going back to papa johns they always load it down with toppings  i like pepperoncinis and hate tootsie rolls anyway lol go ahead make my day","5765":"good resturant that i frequent  chicken kabobs and rice is always good  portions arent huge but i didnt order any pasta  pasta orders get large and they are also tasty  they have a 20 oz steak but i havent ordered it yet  i think that there should be two of me to order a 20 oz steak  well pretty soon now","5766":"they use the adjective urban a little differently than in the midwest  where i come from its a euphemism middle class white people who are trying to avoid sounding prejudiced use to describe africanamericans specifically or nonwhite people in general  as in a contemporary urban music radio station which plays hiphop  this grocery store seems to specialize in what i would call distinctly suburban tastes  its mostly gourmet artisinal glutenfree craft and pretentious goods but they also have velveeta shells  the prices seem high but then im not sure what free range bison steaks should cost in a downtown grocery  theres really no competition the only other place to get snacks is a cvs  the workers are very nice theres an interesting choice of wine and beer and you can get bus passes here","5768":"first time stopping by this drivethru coffee stand  coffee was full flavored not watery like dutch bros  i enjoyed it  also ordered a baconegg potato cheese breakfast burrito  it was very good  they owner makes them daily or every other day and heats them up when ordered  they are well made and the green salsa is good but pretty small in size  i liked it a lot better than los betos but would be happy if they offered a larger size burrito for an extra 12   anyways the total was around 6 for the medium coffee and small but tasty burrito  not bad  ill be back for sure    i know its a lot to ask but if they got a little griddle and made the burritos fresh the tortilla wouldnt be dry and the ingredients would be piping hot  plus they could offer two sizes","5769":"lovelovelovelove this place good coffee great tea and an awesome hipster ambience yes please   ive run by this place several times in the last month or so in preparation for the rto oddly enough it was my book club meeting that actually brought me inside the place   to start off i had the coconut chai latte and a quiche the latte was decent if a little weak in flavor but the quiche was as tasty as can be they have an interesting and yummy selection of eats and treats so its totally an acceptable place to meet for either breakfast or even lunch   i may have started off with a coconut chai but i ended with a lavender latte twice over what i mean to say isi tried my moms lavender latte loved it so much that i chugged my chai got up and got my own lavender latte then i became a crazed lavender maniac and bought a second lavender latte   thats a lot of lavender   but obviously it was delicious so frothy the lavender is light but strong enough to leave a lasting impression which is surprising considering the fact that its an herbal tea either way i will definitely be coming back for more    as far as the book club meeting went i wouldnt always recommend meeting large groups here there is absolutely enough seating to accommodate a large group but the place seems to be perpetually packed   overall it was a nice experience i look forward to coming back and having another lavender latte and they have a bunch of other interesting tea blends as well   happy yelping","5770":"well out to grab some quick mexican food without having to wait i searched through my bookmarks and being new in town and not an insider yet saw a tremendous amount of traffic for the first two weeks its been open so up to sobro i go  i arrived it what appeared as a shopping complex thats had better days i think this shopping center may have been featured in judgement night featuring denis leary but now im digressing so i abscond from my car with my wallet and shuffle inside my first impression of here was that it was new considering there was just a cloth sign covering the previous owners sign the interior is not much to look at but i was there for one thing  tacos  i said hi to the owner who was more than polite and decided on 4 tacos one of each meat i had a seat while my mouth watered before i knew it the food was in front of me and the cctv captured me drooling if you are unfamiliar with authentic mexican tacos they consist of double wrapped corn shells with meat white onion and cilantro  here they are also served with lime cucumber and red and green sauces on the side nice touch  no cheese for you and that suits me just fine now indy tacos let me taste your wares  the chicken very juicy and flavorful very spiced but not spicy 5 the steakinsanely juicy and meaty strong taste of pepper this was the best of the bunch 5 chorizo oh how i love you mexican sausage spicy full flavor 5 al pastori wasnt digging the pineapple flavor but id still give it a solid 4   when i come back ill probably get it to go and take it to the park because the inside of the restaurant makes me feel like im in a cubicle but the food more than made up for the lack of quality ambiance while i was eating i say at least 15 pickup orders came in and theyre off to a rocket start the next will be me  customer service 5 food plus 5 ambiance 3 solid 4 overall and once again if you see me in there back off or ill buy out their whole stock","5772":"great time went with my best friend and it was our first visit  everything was delicious a lovely outing","5773":"this little coffee shop is easy to miss as its not on a main thoroughfare and its tucked into the first floor of a commercial building im glad i found it on yelp though because the coffee is delicious and its a decent spot for working  its cute and modern inside but i agree with some other yelpers in that its slightly lacking in atmosphere and personality not a big deal but a good point i couldnt really put my finger on it also didnt help that the female barista that day wasnt especially friendly  in any case the coffee is really good i absolutely looooved my drink  so much that i wanted to get another it was a pretty small drink its on the specialty menu called little sweet thing or something similar it was to die for a small rocks glass with espresso half  half and vanilla shaken with ice it sounds simple but it was soooo good  more like a dessert than a coffee","5783":"came here on a saturday and ate at the bar with 2 others its a really neat setup with a really long communal table in the middle as well as other separate tables throughout the restaurant  they have some really different burger combinations that i would never think of on my own or you can get something really basic too  i love that the beef is grassfed  you cant find this at many places  and that they are so many types of meat to choose from i had the pbj which was our bartenders favorite the burgers themselves were smaller and thicker which left us with some extra bun at the end but we all still enjoyed the flavor combinations  we also shared a large order of fries which was the perfect amount for 3 without overstuffing us between us 3 we ordered a pitcher of the cherry limeade  it was perfect for a hot day and definitely worth it if everyone in your group wants to drink  i was worried it would be too sweet but the lime balances it out the bartenders were friendly and attentive and the food came out at a good pace  i would definitely return if i was in st louis again","5784":"i have never heard of molldelis until today when a friend suggested meeting there for lunch  i have driven past the plaza where the restaurant is located and never even noticed it  however i am glad i now know it is there  i ordered the french dip sandwich which was a big sandwich and was served hot  it came with a choice of chips or pasta salad  the staff was very friendly and welcoming they have a large catering menu which i will be suggesting at work meetings  they have a rather large dining area and a playroom for kids","5786":"just tried this place for the first time what a fantastic find the ingredients were fresh and the people were great   if youre on the northwest side and looking to find a place we can design your own pizza this is the place for you  give them a try you will not regret it","5787":"this place is awesome fresh vegetables live seafood market and shelves after shelves of things you never thought people would eat or products that even existed you could be here for days like an amusement park and not see everything that there is to see the produce section provides uniqueness and value i saw fruit and vegetables either offering twice as much product for grocery store prices or prices half as much as you would spend in a grocery store very impressed they also have a deli in the back but dont look for boars headno no look for ducks head ha blue crabs dungeness crabs eels squid shrimp talapia they have it all a full butcher shop as well the way a grocery store should be","5788":"im impressed by the surrounding and the vibeas an ipa lover i must admit that the slap bracelet is solid","5789":"grilled pork bahn mi with fish sauce was great fresh crusty french bread made this sandwich mango boba tea and chicken wings were good spring rolls were decent very pleasant staff","5791":"we love to go here its a cute spot for a burger and major benefit you can get tots love the icecream its a cute hidden gem","5792":"really good food as a group we tried a variety of things on the menu and were not disappointed by anything ordered only downside is its not the best place to dine in due to lack of space other than that its great","5794":"castrillos is the neighborhood pizza joint of riverside village  theres no indoor seating so its a pick up and go or get delivery kind of place but i love ordering from there whenever im visiting in east nashville  they offer your typical pizza place toppings and pies as well as a couple more creative options  the seafood pizza is in reality as crazy as it sounds definatly for the adventurous  i remember when i picked it up after ordering the employee behind the counter greeted me with a so youre who ordered that pizza  not really sure if that was to him a good or bad thing but he was jovial when he said it    as good as it is their pizza is not what makes them stand out to me  theyre feta cheese sticks are so delicious and the amount they give you is amazing you could really order that instead of a pizza and be full  they offer salads sandwiches and other pizaa shop type food but its their wings that i will recommend to anyone thinking of eating here  they are hands down the best ive had in nashville so far  first of all theyre huge nothing like the wimpy chicken wings you get in most places  i can easily say theyre twice the size of your average wing and they cook them until theyre so tender the meat falls into your mouth  they only have three flavors but theyre all so tasty you could eat them every day  the mild wings are a dry rub which is deliciously unusual and come with banana peppers sprinkled on top the hot wings are wet and come with jalapenos and the bbq come with pineapple    im craving them again as im sitting here writing this and am contemplating driving over there right now in the cold to get some","5796":"had the chitterlings plate with spaghetti and cole slaw it was really good the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean","5797":"love this place the buffet is always kept cleaned and stocked the selection of sushi is great too for the price you pay the staff is on top of their game when getting drinks and always taking the dirty plates away always smiling food tastes fresh and wide selection of hot bar items too","5799":"i found this place from a yelp search since i was swinging by reno and i was happy with my meal the place is a popular option and the prices were very reasonable and there is a 10 discount via yelp when you spend over 40 the restaurant itself is very basic but the service was friendly  the food  crispy popcorn chicken in the new york area we call this salt and pepper chicken i thought these were great they were perfectly fried without being greasy at all they were nice and crunchy and had a nice seasoning to it httpswwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselectxekjnktrhnb3tauylryk7quseridyittjkvv5hly880szzla  spicy chicken with basil in ny this is three cup chicken this is a staple dish in taiwanese cuisine and the one here was respectable i enjoyed the flavor but it was too sweet for me and the chicken bones were kinda dangerous there was a good amount of chicken bone fragments throughout with tiny points so be very careful the stir fried ginger pieces were excellent but make sure to not eat the chili they pack a punch  saut\u00e9ed green beans these were simple but it was prepared well it was stir fried string beans and the flavors were respectable its a good veg dish to get  zha jiang mien i thought this was just ok i thought the noodles were overdone and kinda gloppy the flavor of the sauce was alright but it was on the greasysalty side","5800":"excellent hidden comfort food brunch spot great for a first date or meet up with friends","5802":"we love pizza mizza it is a wonderful place for the whole family also at least once a month i meet my girlfriends there for a glass of wine while our boys are playing basketball at the ymca fast service  the staff is always friendly","5804":"fresh thoughtful tacos  the bbq is a must try slow cooked sweet tasty  the slaw crunchy fresh  service quick and tables are proportioned correctly","5805":"i dont drink buds but this tour is a must if you are in stl   free tour with 2 free drafts you cant skip it there is a lot of history to this breweryafterall its the nations top notch brewery or so we have been told they also have a vip tour which cost money but its almost the same i imagine anyhow its a cool tour i dont want to ruin it for you by describing what goes behind closed doors go check it out for yourself and make sure to drink up happy touring","5809":"great location for the east falls neighborhood they always seem to run out of vegetables by dinner time i always recommend wawa this place is the reason to live up north","5810":"would be nice if maybe the same person was  not writing all of the terrible reviews of this restaurant it all sounds the same and then praising another as much","5814":"neighborhood grocery store that is a throwback place  not a great selection and prices are higher but the workers are friendly and the location is amazing  wish more neighborhoods had spots like this","5816":"ive eaten at tortugas many times over the years sometimes for dinner and sometimes for lunch while it may not be the most authentic mexican ive ever had the food is consistently good ive tried many things from the menu and have yet to be disappointed the complimentary chips and salsa they give is delicious and very fresh tasting   as others have mentioned the service can be a little slow at times but its never been unbearable and it always seemed to me to coincide with them having a larger than average crowd and just being slightly understaffed  most times ive been here at lunch it has just been 1 waitress and 1 busboy doing the whole place   the only slight downer is i have noticed that the portion sizes appear to have shrunk the last few times i have been here at least for lunch and that is mostly what i come here for as its close to work the burritos and other lunch platters definitely used to be a bit bigger and more packed maybe its just a variable that changes depending on who is cooking its not a deal breaker but still its something you notice when you are used to being served a certain size  overall a good option to satisfy your craving for south of the border","5817":"my mom had a groupon so we decided to drive over  its only the next exit off the vets expressway from her  i was concerned at first because it looked dead  there were only two familiesa couple and maybe a 2 people at the bar on a weekend  we were seated by a friendly hostess and then greeted by our waitress  she suggest a light pasta dish for mom and i ordered a strawberry salad and a seared ahi tuna app  i was very impressed with the salad  i even asked for a small side of strawberries in addition they were very firm fresh and sweet the spinach and dressing was outstanding  the seared ahi tuna was lightly pan seared and crusted in sesames  i loved it it was perfect mom loved her pasta seafood dish it had a baby lobster and huge shrimp with a light sauce not cream based so it was a healthier alternative to the alfredo sauce offered at most chain places  over all i was very pleased with our experience it was a nice relaxing late lunch  i would go again the groupon was a great value    psask for melissa to wait on you  very sweet informative and professional    ohhand the manager even goes around and says little things to everyone you can tell he likes being there","5819":"lots of ac on a hot day god bless the darkness chocolate croissant was nicely balanced not too sweet and not overwhelmingly salty like some saltchocolate combinations tend to be also got meringues which were fine do they do almond croissants i want an almond croissant","5820":"their coffee employees and ambiance are all fantastic  i love to stop in while working remotely   only complaint seating  it would be nice to sit on something other than a stool  soft seating or some actual chairs with back support would be wonderful","5822":"really a 45 we loved our mini suite on the third floor view was of an abandoned building next door but the hm cant help that breakfast fair why cant we get a good cup of coffee in any hotel in nola loved the location off bourbon very quiet housekeeper very friendly beds comfy would definitely stay here again but hoping for a better quality breakfast","5823":"this place was pretty great i love their snow cones and tromo is the best place to go for one however they started jacking up the prices due to the high costs of kirkwoods farmers market rent they unfortunately now have to pay for the booth plus the people that are in line oh yeah the lines get pretty pathetic sometimes after about 5 minutes if the line isnt moving i say a snow cone isnt worth a 20 minute wait but then again i could be suffering from snow cone withdrawal lol","5826":"im a latina from texas so i know mexican food my husband and i are here for the first time not much to choose from on the menu i had the pollo ranchero grilled chicken breast covered with estelas own spicy ranchero saucethin mole sauce and alittle spicy cheese saucewith corn tortillas a guacamole salad and my choice of side was refried beans the dish was delicious the only bad thing i have to say is the chips n dip salsa tasted like tomato paste i didnt like it but my husband did i would definitely return if im back in town","5832":"i worked down the street from the one in westshore area so i was excited to see this one open up in carrollwood tried the cranberry club with potato saladit was delicious staff could be a little more friendly maybe theyre just new and uncomfortable food was fresh and tasty worth a stop in","5835":"customer service is not ever great here however you can find true local produce gems at reasonable prices compared to conventional stores","5836":"snoballs are amazing but its soooo hot in there why have an indoor snoball place with no ac i dont get it   ordered the strawberry lemonade and the pelican so good and unique i love that they put cheesecake in their snoballs the ice is smooth but not as good as hansens","5838":"nice atmosphere delicious beautiful plates good service smaller servings than expected for the price but again delicious","5841":"a nashville staple a great selection of pancakesfrench toast and all that sweet stuff filled with carbs  the thing is they do it really well im a big fan of the blueberry pancakes other than that its your typical breakfast joint that serves bacon eggs and the traditional breakfast foods not a big fan of their coffee though which is disappointing with all the roasters in town   the staff is always pretty friendly and they move pretty quick to accommodate the high flow of people wanting to chow down  avoid going fridaysunday its just a nightmare and in my opinion not worth standing in line for an hour or two","5844":"nice little spot on the end of the wharf it can be a little crowded on tourist weekends so i prefer weekdays for lunch pretty good food cold beer great views good service and a nice atmosphere","5845":"we have been regularly going to the voorhees iron hill location for a few years now the ambiance is friendly and casual the beers are good and im not a beer lover and the food is always impressive weve gone with kids with family and with friends and its always a good experience how busy it is can be hit or miss  sometimes we walk in with a reservation and feel foolish because the place is half empty a month later well stroll in spur of the moment and need to wait 45 minutes for a table the appssmall plates are always a hit and their burgers are delicious my favorites are the brewski and zeus i dont think ive ever had dessert here because im always stuffed   i do have one beef  they changed the nachos for years iron hill had the best nachos ever the last time we went the nachos were different with unwanted guac different cheeses and toppings and an odd drizzle that none of us liked please go back to the old nachos","5846":"good spot to end up after a long day at the beach no dress code simple friendly  the food we ordered was good steamed shrimp lobster crab ","5847":"my beerdrinking friends really enjoyed the heart of gold beer  i am a sodadrinker and have lived in st louis for 16 years and perennial makes the best soda i have ever had in st louis  it was made from missouri apples   the decor in this place is sparse making you focus on your drink  they have a short menu with some nice food  note that there is no table service you need to go to the bar to order whatever you want to eat or drink","5850":"this is the second time experiencing in riva but the first review   went twice on one night so i was able to experience two aspects of the place the first time was pregame for an event we had at the laurel hill cemetery we stood at the bar the bar itself is very small and i felt like i was crowding the people sitting at the high top table behind me the bartender was very nice but could have used more knowledge of the beer selection they didnt seem to know much about the style of the beer   the second time was after the event we were running late and i called to let them know we had reservations at 9 and they were very pleasant and accommodating when we arrived we sat at a table one of the first things you notice is the pizza oven with pizzas constantly going in and out of it so we had to order pizza and really its the only thing ive ordered and all i can say is fantastic  we split two pizzas and took the rest home we got the marcherita pizza with white anchovy the anchovies werent your typical little salty fish no they were large semisalty fish and the pizza was delicious the other pizzawhich we liked alittle better was the mushroom and zucchini really great mushroom taste the waitress was very friendly and we enjoyed having her as our server but again could use more knowledge of the bar","5857":"lots to do at the hard rock both the lounge and cafe are great i enjoy stopping on the casino floor watching the action also there is a large variety of food available at the buffet make sure you check it out for the weekly special","5858":"my sister and i have visited tarpon springs three times once a year and hellas is always our destination for lunch  the service is spoton and the food is great  i have had their gyro which is tender and succulent and full of good flavor  i also have had their cod and it was a pleasant surprise  i never knew that cod was that good  my sister has also had many of their dishes and really liked them  one hint get there early  otherwise you will have to wait for a table  highly recommended","5859":"this place is a must for dessert everytime i am dining on grand  literally we start with dinner walk up for gelato and an espresso cubano to set us up for the remainder of the evening where we will no doubt be sipping naughty martinis at absolutli goosed    the staff is always very nice and give too much gelato   very comfortable seating and ambiance  they have a very broad range of gelato flavorsmy faves so far have been the london fog chai blueberry and pistachio  really cant go wrong they do all of the flavors well","5860":"cafe deluxe was awesome this used to be a laundromat back in the day and now theyve established a quirky little breakfast spot we got some kind of breakfast scramble with meats and various other veggie ingredients we ordered some flour tortillas on the side which were huge   the egg scrambles were huge portions so after we got our fill i made us two huge burritos to go   cool place nice people and great coffee","5861":"the habit has hands down my favorite onion rings ever they are cooked perfectly and they pair perfectly with the ranch sauce my hamburger was good but i was fixated on my onion rings","5864":"we love this place from the open air setup and outdoor seating to the deliciously unique rolls and friendly wait staff this is my friends and is south philly goto though theyre busy we can always get a good table on a friday night  the special roll is always a hit and my personal favorite is the remy roll the vegetarian vegan sushi is also amazing if thats your thing ask them to make you an avocado and sweet potato roll with benito flakes   whats really special though is their seaweed salad this is no average run of the mill seaweek and nothing like the typical you get at sushi joints their seaweed is fresh and served in mellow vinegar and lemon absolutely delicious even my apprehensive friend was wowed and loved it the only reason why we didnt give izumi 5 stars is we figured there are even more insane sushi spots we have yet to try but for now this is our favorite ","5865":"ive been going to this wawa pretty much every week since they opened for business service is good enough and gas prices are competitive with the area","5866":"putting boises cupcake specialty shops to the test  thanks in large part to the steady popularity of foodthemed media americans are quick to become infatuated with the food fad of the day  as we allow these trends to be fed to us many cities across the nation will inevitably experience a surge in businesses capitalizing on whatever these food crushes happen to be rarely however do many of those eateries survive in the longterm because after all our appetites become satisfied yet appetites are insatiable and the talking heads of television are happy to let us know what we should be eating next  the passing fancy of cupcakes notwithstanding  every once in a while a good eatery goes the distance in boises case there are three specialty shops that still boast cupcakes as the main attraction  the mission to predict which of these businesses will continue to be prosperous and which of them if any are on the road to selfdestruction as an overview what i found is that two of the three shops should in the very least be able to remain popular among diehard cupcake fans but one of them well ill be surprised if theyre still open in the next 12 months  the contenders were graded based on the cupcakes taste presentation and texture counter service and store atmosphere  here are the results for this business sugar rush cupcakery  the hardest thing to deal with is getting there strangely enough as hightraffic as fairview avenue is sugar rush is easy to miss its situated in a strip mall that sits back off of the road a bit crossing over the road onto the driveway and into the parking lot from the eastbound lanes can a whiteknuckle experience when dealing with rush hour consequently no matter what the current traffic volume i highly recommend coming in from the westbound side if you can  once youre in the seating area is wide and spacious almost too spreadout if thats even possible  if nobody is at the counter when you walk in someone will appear within seconds counter service is pleasant and unobtrusive the employees are patient and willing to answer questions  part of the reasonneed for their patience is that youll find that the display cases are filled with very creative funtoeat flavors which might make it difficult to choose  they use real butter in their butter cream frosting and they are very proud of that fact  a true buttercream frosting firms up when chilled yet no hard shell forms on the outside the creaminess and sweetness should have a nice balance fortunately this is the case here  their cake holds together well and it has an even moist texture  although this cupcakery wasnt able to dethrone what i experienced to be the best cupcakes in the nation if youre looking for the best cupcakes in boise sugar rush has the recipe    do you want to know how the other two cupcake specialty shops match up click on the review links

have only been here once i have to say my first time was amazing it isnt really diner food per say i think it is geared more towards a jewish palette i ordered almond encrusted french toast with eggs over hard which no one cooks right and saugage links the french toast was incredible my eggs were cooked as best they could which is fine the waitress was as sweet and attentive i really want to go back there sometime soon","5876":"district donuts is awesome the donuts are the best thing to get they are very reasonably priced considering the amazing flavors you get the pecan pie donut was fabulous the sliders are decenta bit pricey at 450 for one overall the place is a hidden gem definitely recommend visiting","5878":"good food and service the lox bagel was very fresh enjoyed the ambience of the cafe as well","5880":"i am very particular with my cupcakes i like a moist cake with a sticky frosting i know thats not popular most cupcakes have the frosting that hardens   the flying cupcake is probably right in the middle  the frosting isnt sticky but its definitely not hard its creamy and luscious   i went on small business saturday an amexsponsored event the flying cupcake had samples out and not just pieces of cake with icing little mini cupcakes one per customer   i was with another adult and two children we purchased four cupcakes and cut them into quarters and were even given four mini cupcakes to sample so we cut those up too   needless to say i got to try a lot of cupcakes that day    for me the red velvet was probably my least favorite just too sugary for my tastes but i can see the appeal   my favorite was a golden cake with white icing  nice a simple so good","5881":"there are lots of people waiting in line but its really clean place to eat inside i had really good experience ordering online using coupon code and just waited for pick up that will save your time","5883":"the original and teriyaki wings are awesome and the menu is so eclectic love it the servers are nice sometimes the wait is a little longer than i like so i recommend ordering ahead of time","5884":"there is an abundance of fresh seafood options in santa barbara   my gf and i like sb seafood co because the food is fresh the atmosphere is awesome views of the harbor are excellent and the service is friendly  seating inside and outside are a bit scarce but if you are lucky enough to get one of the 4 outdoor tables you will have an amazing view of the harbor and pier   daily specials vary   we went big for dinner last time ordering maine lobster and alaskan king crab  this time around for lunch we tried to order light   we started with the lobster bisque and a couple of oyster shooters  the bisque was pretty amazing the shooters were on par w brophys which were very tasty  for the main event i ordered maine lobster roll pretty bombloaded w lobster meat i split it with my gf it came with onion rings and cole slaw   my gf ordered the fried oysters calamari shrimp and scallops pretty delicious the calamari were a little over cooked and chewy though the rest were well executed  santa barbara seafood co is a nice option on the pier and is definitely a nice spot to grab good eats when a seafood craving is in order","5885":"fast fast fast pizza 180 seconds and they are calling your name wow the red vine is the classic fresh mozzarella cherry tomatoes basil and parmesan salads were and ready togo","5891":"blondies makes me wish i still worked downtown it is a great addition to washington and ive been mostly impressed the two times ive been first just for drinks late on a saturday other than 23 other small parties the place was quiet i was really surprised considering how busy everything else seemed to be the decor is brilliant  cozy comfortable and practical its a mix of normal dining tables along with armchairs and sofas since we werent ordering food we were able to relax by the fire nice  i was also there for lunch on saturday and the food was delicious i tried the veggie sandwich and the turkey green apple mayo sandwich both came on a plain popover which made them impossible to eat with your hands they were closer to an openfaced sandwich which leads me to my first complaint  the paper than they cover the plates with makes no sense at all the sauce from the sandwiches quickly made the paper soggy and since i had to eat with utensils i was carving up the paper along with my sandwich it was really annoying and impossible not to do but thats an easy fix the veggie was worlds better than the turkey and this is only the second time ever ive raved about a veggie sandwich you get either chips or fruit as a side and the chips come in a generous portion  my other complaint is service was really really slow slow to order really slow to get our food even though again there were only 3 other tables occupied and we never did get our check delivered we eventually went up front to pay if service is like this during the work week i cant imagine who would continue to go here  big bonus points for playing tcm on the tvs but not cool that they have two bathrooms both of which are unisex please make one a boys and one a girls i hate using a public restroom after a guy gross  but overall i love this place and it seems to work equally well as a lunch spot or late night hangout which few places can do","5892":"took advantage of the free doughnut coupon from krispy kreme so with all the signage and hype for the pumpkin flavored fall doughnuts i chose the pumpkin cheesecake and it was very very good especially the free part","5893":"tasty get the special sald with the grilled hot chicken what a  semihealthy treat","5896":"whirled peace was perfect for this abnormally warm january saturday  i helped myself to samples of a few flavors how great is it that they put out the small sample cups so you can do that  their tart plain and chocolate are solid i am not a huge fan of the delche de leche or the egg nog maybe a little too artificial   but red velvetwow  i cant kvell over this flavor enough its been done to death in cupcakes and donuts but i had not seen it as a yogurtice cream flavor it worked so well the machine called it low fat but im skeptical because it tasted way too good to be lowfat   one little note the containers say all the stores products are compostable so why is there no compost receptacle in the store compostable spoons and cups do nothing good for the environment in a landfill","5898":"happy hour here is outstanding 5 drinks and 5 select apps our favorite was the squash blossom quesadilla the chicken flautas were okay and the goat cheese empanadas were tasty their signature margarita comes from a machinewhich was offputting however they do not skimp on the tequila as one would think order it and enjoy","5900":"nice bakery with plenty of goodies to choose from i bought the paleo pumpkin pie which was deliciously amazing the staff and service is great place is clean and inviting","5901":"just as good as the other five guys ive been to but i hate that a single is little i always forget and get too much food","5906":"the buffalo chicken wrap was delicious we also had fried shrimp very good large portions","5907":"great atmosphere really fun list of cocktails knowledgeable mixologist my husband had their classic manhattan incredible i had the garden hoe highly recommend for a hot summer day  definitely want to go back to try other cocktails and some of their tempting bar snacks","5909":"this place was great we were in town for a dr appointment and needed some lunch before the appt i got the lamb gyro with fries and my husband got the same but with a side of falafel   the lamb was nicely cooked and cut thick the gyros yogurt sauce was amazing some of the best ive had recently great food at a reasonable price perhaps split a meal if you arent starving though huge portions","5910":"great food but took forever to come out of the kitchen and it was not a busy night  my friend and i sat at a high top in the bar area and it was very loud and difficult to talk  the guacamole was fantastic and i would definitely eat here again","5912":"im a fan of this little hole in the wall coffee joint the staff is really nice and seem to care about you and the coffee options they make their cold brew is fantastic and their latte is awesome theyre hidden so youll need to track them down as they actually share the area with a church i guess the only downside is that theyre still small so closed on sundays hopefully they can get bigger and expand their hours","5915":"i will be upfront that my only experience with the market so far is the yelp spring feastival  so i know i am viewing it through rosecolored glasses  that being said i liked what i saw and tasted  even though i live close by i never knew what was down there  now that i do i can honestly see myself altering my commute home to take advantage  especially since they are open until 7 during the week  the fish market looked particularly appealing as a place to grab a prepared entree or something to cook myself  the produce market was wellstocked including a wide selection of asian condiments not crazily overpriced and the employees were extremely sweet and helpful  this spot would not work as far as a cheap food court to eat lunch every day because most of the selections are on the pricey side  however from what i saw on the menus they appeared in line with the higherend quality  lets face it  a smoked turkey brie and pear relish sandwich from dibruno brothers should set you back more than a 6 subway","5919":"have attended many discussion groups and happy hours here the speed of service is very impressive last night they had a full house and my food was still served in only a few minutes menu is vegetarian friendly be sure to specify if youre vegan i have yet to try a food item i dislike but the black bean burger and the beer bread are my favorites the real winner of course is the assortment smallbatch brews  look for seasonal varieties as well as regular favorites  order the sampler and try them all","5920":"this place is within walking distance a few years ago an old coworker would bring these donuts into the office every friday like clockwork i left that company and hadnt had them in years i finally ordered a dozen yesterday to take to a fantasy football draft party they were a hit   very tasty reasonably priced and friendly service","5921":"we are attending a volleyball tournament in tampa and decided to stay in and order food to avoid the valentine restaurant rush we ordered the fried ravioli caesar salad fettuccine alfredo with a house salad and pasta marinara with garlic knots we used the yelp app to order delivery it gave us a window of 7090 minutes it was closer to 2 hours but our hotels valet is jammed and there is a hockey game down the street the salads were fresh and delicious the caesar and greek dressing were probably the best i have ever had the pasta was good the garlic knots and ravioli were delicious i would give them 5 stars except for the fact that they did not include silverware in the to go order to a hotel i had to go to the restaurant in the hotel and ask for silverware not a big deal except it was already 9 pm and i was in my jammies the hotel staff may be traumatized for life i would however for sure dine in and order from them again and ask for silverware","5922":"this is a great place to go for crab  lobster as locals weve come many times over the years first the clam chowder is the best ive ever had and the bisque is also great stay away from the crab cakes unless you like a gluten type cake also as much as i love abalone this is not the place to order it why they dont just pound it and fry it in pepper  salt flour is unknown all the tacos are excellent cole slaw and onion rings are awesome plan on spending 100 plus for 2 if you have drinks and a shellfish dinner worth it","5923":"what can i say about wawa doesnt just about everyone love wawa whether its for the flavorful coffee options or the delicious sandwiches people flock to wawa  this location gets a super abundance of foot traffic because its in a prime center city location before work during lunch and after work this place is on and poppin because they use an electronic order system the process is easy  much faster than other stores where you have to wait in line to place the order it is also a streamlined process because instead of paying after your food is ready you pay while the food is being prepared this my friends is the true genius of their awesomeness   that being said this particular location can get real gritty real fast the minimal seating area may have trash left on it from inconsiderate customers andor trash may be found on the floor many homeless people frequent this location as well usually to do you the gracious service of holding the door so that you will oblige them with a meal as you leave the store  im a city girl so these factors dont keep me from going to this location in fact this is the one i go to the most its actually the one that gives the fastest service in the city especially when you consider the volume of customers they serve","5925":"so after a few months of driving by this place on the way to kroger i decided to give it a try we arrived mid sunday morning and im guessing thats not the best time to show up there was a line of people some were outside it looked like they had pieces of paper with typed numbers to prioritize hungry diners i strongly recommend they upgrade to a text alert system its much more efficient   anyways since it was for a table of two it was about a 10 minute wait before we were seated its a quaint spot with lots of food photos and paintings of indiana sports teams i really liked the atmosphere chill and inviting the host was very accommodating in making sure we got a table away from the door it was a little chilly once seated we made our orders mexican skillet golden house frittata and cr\u00eape with fruit im not sure if it was short on staff or too many diners but it was worth the wait i really enjoyed the cr\u00eape its very rare when you have a cr\u00eape with just the right amount of syrup it wasnt too sugary or saucy and the fruit was fresh the frittata though slightly burnt around the edges was also very tasty and the pancakes were very scrumptious   all in all i really enjoyed the food and the service i really wished i remembered the waitress name for proper recognition this is certainly my new greenwood breakfast spot the location is perfect for a good meal followed by a grocery run id certainly go again probably before or after the apparent sunday morning rush","5926":"best smoked meats  the bar is cozy and there always seems to be friendly people to talk to great place i recommend it","5927":"four visits with great food and beer we had one problem with a tough tuna app and it was taken care of manager apologized and it was off our bill servers great seating outside and in much needed restaurant of this type in this location love the onion soup meat loaf and pizzas we will be regulars","5928":"this place had pretty average reviews but i went there anyway like previous reviewers have mentioned the salsa is pretty spectacular my friend actually drank the left over lime juice when we finished the fresh veggies there were more chips left so we ordered another one the waitress brought it but at no time did she tell us it was 150 we had assumed it was free refills we found out that assumption was wrong when we got the bill   i ordered the choose 2 combo tamali with shredded beef and enchilada with chorizo i was pretty full from the chips so i only ate the tamali the shredded beef was spot on and the corn filling was great too nothing special about the enchilada so i just packed it up to bring home the accompanying rice wasnt too bad the refried beans were dry and looked like paste   my friend ordered the carribean burrito with ground beef they werent given the option of shredded just chicken or beef he said everythign else was good except the beef it was dry and poorly seasoned","5931":"had plans to check out collingswood mayfair and was happy to walk out the door to see this truck blocking my st off of haddon ave  this was almost my first meal of the day but since i heard all these greet things i decided to hold off n glad i did cos after walking both ends of the fair it was hot and my first meal of the day was a sub par pulled pork sandwich from the lumpys bbq stand  ive been outside for almost 2 hours and needed another meal before heading home and hit up this truck i love cheese curds and this may b the best around  one order was i think 9 but worth it for the 89 pieces i got with the srirachia mayo i think real good way to end the afternoon","5934":"why arent these everywhere it is a free standing counter service through the window type of joint like an old dairy queen or tastee freeze but much yummier very limited seating one bench but the custard was so good that i was too busy shoveling it into my mouth to notice or care i guess it is better for my waistline that there are not more of these around next time i will get a concrete custard mixed with one or more ingredients i got a chocolate sundae but the chocolate tasted more like caramel i thought about complaining but i couldnt stop eating","5937":"happy hour until 7 is the big headline here   the pizza is delicious fresh and fast had some potatoes in a bacon jam also delicious but a little on the light side   the atmosphere is nice everybody is very friendly they will certainly have my business again","5938":"we enjoy 101 taiwanese cuisine  seating is limited which can make it hard to get in on friday and saturday nights but worth the wait  prices are reasonable and portions are huge always have leftovers  they have tv screens that show various meals really neat and helpful to see various dishes","5940":"move in near by month ago and tried the shrimp salad  awesome will be going back soon","5941":"we loved the strawberry shortcake with whip cream and the strawberry pizza it tasted so fresh and delicious they didnt have much produce because they were closing down for the season we really enjoyed the sweets i would recommend it to anyone","5945":"yolklore challenges assumptions that a counterservice restaurant cant deliver thoughtful elevated food i was so impressed with my frittata and my husband raves about the billy the kid all the ingredients were top notch and all dishes were plated beautifully delicious great kid options available my son devoured his little dipper pancakes the restaurant is a bit small so you may struggle to find a table during busy weekend hours but the staff is very welcoming and helpful","5946":"love the laid back vibe and the patio that faces the monon they have several good things i like the drunken ravioli pub ploughmans platter and beer crock cheese my kiddos love their chicken finger meals and everything is reasonably priced wait staff is always great","5947":"still loving this place but feel like i need to bring an extra container for the excess cream chesse not complaining that they give you a lot of product but i also dont want to die from a cream cheese heart attack","5948":"neat and trendy little ice cream shop on whyte ave and the other side of the tracks went there during art walk and there was a bit of a line the lines moved pretty quickly though and soon we were at the front they had four flavors you could mix only certain combinations since they come out of a soft serve machine we ended up getting yam and coconut flavor swirl the cone cost 550 and the flavors were nice and not overly sweet which fit my personal preference it is definitely a bit on the pricey side but i think worth a try its nice to see stores like this opening up along whyte ave","5949":"update they have a jumbo size now thus eliminating the pettiness of my complaint at having no drink left by the time i arrive at my destination after purchasing a regular boba   i come here almost weekly and am still trying to figure out the sugar quantities in these drinks its either too much or too little and appears to differ greatly based on who is making your drink i still thoroughly enjoy the jasmine green milk tea with regular boba and am still struggling to find a new flavor due to my inability to order outside of this","5951":"probably the best lobster place in the area we love to go for the summer lobsters in august they couldnt be better","5956":"weve gotten from here a bunch of times while over at friends place cant compare it to other places local to it but overall its a winner weve gotten a variety of soups apps entrees and combo platters from both the chinese and japanese sections of the menu everything has been tasty though id give their wonton soup 3 stars","5958":"we love labellas my husband and i have been going there for 7 years and we cant get enough they have amazing pizza especially the ny style slices they have ready at the shop and great chicken wings they have gluten free products but i cant say its their specialty so stick to what they know best   its a family owned shop where you actually meet the family  you know its great when people are greeted by their first name","5959":"very cute and lovely restaurant with a wonderful vibe we celebrated our anniversary here the other day we tried the yucca fries fried plantains stuffed piquillo peppers and the tres leches cake with peach icecream my faves were the fried plantains and dessert i thought the fries could use more seasoning","5960":"i love five guys  the burgers are outstanding and the fries are good  people will disagree but i think this burger is probably the best in the nola area for the price   it can get a bit pricey though but if you are there with someone you can save some coin  you only need to order the smallest fry and share  they dump so many extra fries in that wonderfully greasy bag that sharing is truly caring  right now in harahan it gets really busy  hopefully when the mid city location opens it will slow down a bit  get over there and check it out  well unless youre one of those nazis that only support local and freak when a chain opens in the area  because then you wont be happy since its a chain","5961":"i couldnt tell the difference between this one and the one at cerritos but this place had alot more room the one in cerritos always felt crowded oh they have bathrooms here i dont remember one at cerritos","5962":"im now giving district donut a four star because their donut lacks the donut itself is too dense it has good flavor but if they were to make the donut dough softer i would give them a five star","5968":"this place sells my favourite bubble teas and such in west edmonton mall the line up always looks so intimidating from a distance once you realize that the line always moves quickly it isnt so bad coupled with the wide selection of options i almost welcome the time that it can take to wait i highly recommend the dream bubble tea which is taro and coconut it is my absolute favourite","5971":"wonderfully friendly and helpful staff excellent manager everything we could possibly want right around the corner","5972":"people are hard on dinardos for the decor but we didnt go last night for decor we went for blue point crabs and they were great  we each had 2 jumbos that were steamed and seasoned perfectly  started with plump mussels in a red sauce we finished with a spoon every member of their staff was friendly and attentive","5974":"my family loves to rant and rave about dairy joy  i guess its been a staple ice cream stand in south tampa  inter bay for decades  anyways this is really an old school ice cream stand they have soft serve hand scooped shakes floats sundaes cones etc all hand made its a classic ice cream experience but nothing fluffed up about it  this place is cashonly however everything is really cheap a normal ice cream cup is about 2 you can get a mini cone for a dollar and other things for between 13 its way worth the cash only price  overall if you dont mind eating outside in the heat its a good ice cream","5975":"i loooove it here this is my go to diner for about two and a half years now i love the food and the waitresses are so great i think i have only been disappointed once when eating here the foods great and i love the atmosphere","5978":"i took my girlfriend here and she got food poisoning lmao but the food was bomb tho \u200d","5982":"went here yesterday around noon with my beau for some breakfast ive been going here for pastries since highschool but only had their real food once before i read some reviews on here and was worried but they must have read yelp and improved where they were lacking   it was busy but we found a table right away this was a miracle since we drove by three places thinking we would eat there but the lines were out the door so we were ecstatic to sit immediately  everything on the breakfast menu looked good we ended up ordering a denver omlette and eggs benedict with ham i do have to say their prices seemed a little highwe were starving so we didnt care that much but around town the prices are a dollar or two less  both our meals were very good the breakfast potatoes were very awesome crispy on the outside and soft enough on inside good flavor too i also love that meals come with a mini pastry mmmmm  for drinks we had a water and a coffee the coffee was promptly refilled the waitresses had good attitudes   one thing that cracked me up was their descriptions on their menu it frequently said this is great or best blah blah in town the best or so yummy it just sounded like an afterthought like oh we should put canned positive words and phrases so people order this a more authentic way to boast would be having the servers pick a favorite dish and putting so and sos favorite breakfast or like what squeeze in does have a legend where a symbol represents most popular dishes i frequently ask servers for their recommendations so im not opposed to what they wrote per say but it made me chuckle  will continue going here we enjoyed our visit  anyway enjoyed our meal here","5983":"really enjoyed my time at pub  kitchen  server was fabulous  however i got stuck in the very back and it was like an ice box with the air blowing right on our table  luckily our server was kind enough to move us to the main dining area where it was much more comfortable    food was very good  pulled pork sandwich was tasty  nothing that would blow you out of your shoes but nonetheless good  fries were also tasty  overall i would definitely come back","5985":"i yelped breakfast and this was one of the first places to come up i made the decision to go here because it was close by well closer than the other results and still served breakfast by the time i was ready to head out the door i walked in after having a little trouble finding parking i ended up parking near the post office around the block  i didnt have to wait at all for a table so some of the other complaints ive read here i cant make the only thing was that the hostess was busy cashing people out so what i thought was a random gentleman abruptly asked me how many it took me a while to decipher and respond to what he was saying i told him i was dining alone and he seated me at a four top right away  i love breakfast food but not of the danish waffle pancake variety eggs bacon sausage to me those are the breakfast foods i know and love when the waitress came by to take my order i decided on the sausage and cheese omelette with jalapenos as well since i was in the south i asked for grits as well the grits arrived first and since i wasnt in the deep south i assumed the grits would be okay i was surprised by them the consistency of it was creamy but not too creamy where the grittiness of the hominy could still be felt   the omelette was more like a cheese foldover with the toppings sprinkled over it i was expecting it to be mixed into the eggs but it was still tasty i think i preferred it like this here because i could really taste the freshness and spiciness of the jalapeno and the sausage looked liked finely minced patties and not links again a nice surprise with how it was presented and they were seasoned quite nicely as well  the omelette was served with a short stack of pancakes so i did get to sample their pancakes i reiterate that i am not a sweet foods breakfast person but i was impressed with their pancakes light and fluffy and the warm syrup was awesome sweet but not overpowering i also wanted to get a to go order for my hostess since she was busy with work and i mentioned that to my waitress when she came by she told me to remind her before i leave but i didnt i didnt have to because she seemed to remember and had it ready for me a little after she dropped of my check  the food is really good and i didnt have to wait nor did i have any of the service issues that others have had maybe i just got lucky but if i come back i will be return maybe the average will go down then but i sure hope not i like this place","5986":"love the ice cream  you can also get pints at rouses for pretty good prices  i love the cafe au lait and beignets flavor","5987":"absolutely love eating at schlafly bottleworks  while i am not personally a beer drinker i am always impressed at how well each server knows their beerincluding the specific ingredients the flavor undertones etc  the food is incredible  always cheese filled  start off with the pretzels and cheese sauce  then always torn between the yummy grilled cheese which includes smoked gouda and the mac n cheese  this last time around the server suggested adding bacon to the mac n cheese  it was mind blowing    schlafly has a great outdoor patio area and usually some fun live music","5988":"wowwhat a beautiful restaurant  the salad bar here makes a cruise ship salad bar look bad  when i see sushi at a salad bar in a nice restaurant  i am in heaven  the choices here were superb and although pricey they have weekly specials that you cannot ignore  the quality of the meats you are presented with being cut right onto your plate for you to enjoy over and over again is class act  service is impeccable and your table is always being watchedas soon as you look like you need something or have a puzzled look on your face a server not always yours comes immediately to your table to solve the issue  nice  towards to sidefront of the restaurant sits one of the classiest looking bars ive seen in a restaurantbartenders always offering up the special drinks  i cant wait to go backskip lunch the day you goyoull want to arrive hungry","5991":"when i visit nashville i make my way to dolls for good ol down home cooking im sure its all good put just load me up with fried chicken mashed potatoes and gravy green beans and cornbread wash it down with sweet tea aw but then a chess square to go  dessert this is seriously good southern cookin in a nice little place where they treat you like a neighbor cant wait to get back to dolls yall save me some chicken and a chess square","5994":"in trying to find a place downtown to meet some friends maynards popped up and i am so glad it did  this restaurant is located in what appears to be a converted train station also attached to the building is the museum  they have valet but they also have a ton of convenient parking nearby  at first we were confused between the bistromarket and the actual more upscale looking restaurant mostly because the bistro looks like it has amazing food in a casual environment  however the restaurant was fantastic and has ambiance in comparison  we were a table of four and each tried something different  burger filet bistro steak and house special pasta  all of us were thrilled with our meals  i had also ordered the mixed green salad which was truly delicious  and i dont normally say that about salads  i also tried their house sangria which is worth going back for  they apparently switch from white wine to red wine on their sangria at the start of fall  my favorite thing about the meal was the dessert  i went with the creme brulee which had this homemade cookie and berries with it  not all creme brulees are created equal and this one is way ahead of the pack in terms of what i have tasted over my lifetime  we would return for sure  the location was really cool as well as the atmosphere prices were reasonable the food outstanding  while i cant get as excited about the service we had  i would say it was good  our server was very nice but he just well was quite inattentive and we had to continue asking for refills on our water and those that ordered icedtea  for a restaurant this size service should be excellent not good because the server was nice","5997":"next to its other location in brandon its the only place for asian markets from tampa to orlando such a great live fish meat and poultry market the only place comes close to this is in ga good job guys","5999":"really relaxed vibe a lot of food for the price and made to order nice spot for good fresh food","6000":"good tasting food thats a staple of the reading terminal market  variety of deserts to choose from that are reasonably priced for a heavy tourist location","6001":"soul sista glad i didnt miss ya  been waiting for this place to open up but i guess i must have missed the memo that it finally did so as i was driving by and saw ppl inside i came to a screeching halt and popped in first and foremost i was impressed by what theyve done with this place def a classy joint asked the waitress what she recommended and she immediately suggested the fried chicken dumbest question of the year so i went with the smothered fried chicken mash and mac and cheese all was excellent especially the mash the waitress was attentive and polite and the food came out quick without a hiccup really rooting for this place to do well in a part of town that desperately needs it ill be back to try some more if everything is as good as what i initially had i may bump to 5 soon","6006":"i just want to add that when you look around this mexican restaurant there are mexicans eating there this is my rule for ethnic restaurants if there are no people of that ethnicity eating there leave  here im the only gringo in the room so its all good and i get to practice my spanish","6007":"i love to get my morning or afternoon coffee here  the hazelnut drip isnt too nutty just the right amount  the sandwiches are good  i especially love the primo pesto chicken  of course i love pesto on anything  some of the staff could use some friendliness lessons but most of the others make up for it  especially merry  she is always warm and welcoming as are several others  for a quick and delicious snack under five bucks go get a toasted sun dried tomato bagel with cream cheese and a coffee perfect","6009":"i will definitely be going back the ice cream was creamy and smooth i had the king cake flavor which had pieces of yummy king cake mixed in the service was great nice atmosphere the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because its cash only luckily i had cash i guess it was my lucky day","6010":"i bring my parents here every time they come in town because they love it so much sour beers are their fav and i love the salad definitely sheds some light on 4th street","6011":"service was soso at first no plates for the cornbread and biscuits but it got better the food was fast and excellent like always had the apple chicken salad it tasted as good as it looked and it definitely filled me up my fianc\u00e9e had her chicken dumplings the usual and her mother had country fried steak check out was fast and friendly perfect meal","6013":"its so exciting to have a beautiful little bake shop further down germantown avenue were very lacking of these types of businesses down at the germantown end i recently picked up cookies and a readtotake red velvet cake with cream cheese icing for a meetingevent everyone thought the cookies were excellent there were some mixed thoughts on the cake the icing was perfect  not too sweet and not too heavy the cake however seemed a bit dry and crumbly or coarse im not sure how far in advance the inventory of cakes are prepared or if maybe the recipe needs a bit of tweaking i may try cupcakes in the future instead very happy to support a new local business and hope they become a successful new addition to the neighborhood","6014":"great nachos specially the nachos grande chickpea soup is good customer service is okay good environment","6020":"love this tiny little shop on chippewa i am a big fan of cake donuts and ddi has some good ones i love that people run it get their donuts then sit in their cars in the parking lot eating and watching the world go by and theyre open late","6021":"have only had the tacos but i recommend them highly fresh ingredients and spicy  parking is a challenge specially at lunch time","6022":"i love this farmers market mostly because i love companion bakery especially their brioche perfect for bread pudding french toast sandwiches etc i also love bittersweet bakery that is always there and tower grove park in general is such a lovely setting for a farmers market  i generally dont buy any of the fruits and veggies just because theyre a bit out of my price range but its a fun place to check out and take photos at  also theres a fountain nearby with tons of kids running through it which just makes the place cuter  i like bringing visiting foodie friends here and they always love it too we always grab a snack andor coffee its a pleasant atmosphere with lots of crisp white stalls with bright colored fresh fruits and veggies","6027":"a great sandwich shop its chainstatus notwithstanding  no matter what time of day or night or latenight i always get great service  these guys know how to handle the college crowd well  the price is right and hey the smells are free","6028":"this is probably the most complete farmers market in the area  the collection of vendors tucked in the middle of tower grove is really great way to start a morning with plenty of awesome lunch  picnic options in the area    with that said ive come here quite often only to leave with nothing  id like to point out that we have some pretty lame mushroom vendors in st louis  the one at soulard is definitely superior but combination of price and variety and severely lacking  all too often i end up going to whole foods after yet another disappointing round of trying to support the local guys  tower grove farmers market also suffers from stands serving the same stuff after many years of trying practically every farmers market in the area i just overall disappointed that few compare to the one at urbana il    ok with all this bitching im going to have to say that this place is worth driving out of the way for as they do have a selection of cheeses mushrooms produce and meat salume beddu has a stand there","6030":"the nook is a good addition to the growing culture of indy  my wife and i were pleasantly surprised and excited to try a new place the kombucharita was a good way to start the evening it was a refreshing twist to a traditional margarita  the bacon guacamole plate was very tasty also and probably my new favorite way to eat guacamole next i had the nook burger and my wife had the chicken strips which she was very excited about bc she never gets to eat things like this due to a gluten allergy  the burger was one of the best i have had in a while and that is saying a lot because i am usually not a fan of gf burger buns the 100 grass fed beef was very lean and left you wanting more my wife was surprised at how well she liked the chicken tenders they had a crispy gf breading on them but she did say that as they cooled down the breading did get a little soggy on the inside but that is normal for gf breading  overall we enjoyed nook and will be eating here again","6031":"best sonoran dog ive had so far the carne asada papancha is amazing only issue is the long wait for food i will be back although probably just for takeout in the summer because its a food truck with a porchlike seating area","6032":"almond horn was a pricey 5 compared to swiss haus and just about as good","6033":"love the food black spaghetti is amazing been to this location four times now  friday nights they are super packed and the service needed improvement i have been multiple times during happy hour and our waitress sarah was amazing she knows the all the dishes and will help with selections  you can tell that she really loves working there because she describes the dishes perfectly","6035":"pretty good  reasonably priced  the place is tiny though  i would love to go back but only if it isnt busy  try it out  youll enjoy it","6041":"the donuts and the sliders here are insane its so hard to just choose one thing if you come with someone else that is willing to share it helps so that you can indulge in a variety of options   oh and get the biscuit i know i know you want donuts and sliders how do you make room for the biscuit i dont know what to tell you you just do it if youre walking or biking all day like we were at least you will most likely burn it off either way though you would be amiss not to try the biscuit   ok ok ok if you are trying to be good and are just going to get one thing then i guess i would choose the donuts last time i was there the butterscotch pecan was available and the cashier highly recommended it now i do too this may be the best donut i have ever had its a close tie with blues donut from the bpb order the yelp a while back   the only disappointing thing here is the coffee i was not impressed at all by the espresso and during my previous visit i found the brewed coffee to be just mediocre thats ok though my tummy was so happy with all the food that the coffee was just left to get cold in the corner","6043":"if u need a little history on ipa etc frank is your guy great food  one of the largest variety of cold brews ive ever seen in a local spot","6050":"ive been lucky enough to work in mid city for several years and fair grinds is one of my gotos for coffee meetings after hours meeting space or just a quiet place to get away and power through some work heres some of the things i love about fair grinds  the location id live here if i had a million dollars and could invest in bayou st john the outdoor seating is there a better way to spend a beautiful new orleans day  bike parking for days clientele can be a little hipstery so this is great upstairs meeting space i often meet with community groups after hours and the staff at fair grinds has been fantastic with some of my annoying last minute requests to use the meeting room thanks guys you make our work easier savory food options i cant always do sweet stuff and theyve always got some interesting savory scones or sandwiches  great decorvibe very comfortable and what a hotel staffer recently described to me as new orleans bohemian ill just leave that phrase there for you do with it what you will outlets outlets outlets need to plug in your laptop because its 10 years old and the battery is crap good so does everyone else luckily theres outlets for everyone so charge away outdoor seating is dog friendly  some things that could be a little better sometimes the wifi isnt quite strong enough for everyone and youll get booted it can be a little crowded and hard to find a seat this is a good thing too im glad theyre doing well and if making a new friend is the worst thing to happen to me ill live","6051":"im from dallas and have yet to find a decent traditional chinese takeout restaurant in the north indy areaits quite disappointing this place is the closest thing to doable that ive found ive been to other places where the fried rice looks and taste more like yellow mexican rice this place actually fries the rice but its nothing im used to but better than what ive had here so far","6053":"we were surprised to see taiwanese restaurant in reno so decided to take out braised pork over rice and popcorn chicken bento and some boba tea both meal had way a little too much rice compared to the amount of meat on top although it wasnt bad at all we came back the next day ordered chicken chow mein and fried calamari pot roast pork over rice they were pretty good and kids liked them too  their price is reasonable next time well order entree with rice on the side","6054":"i have been here couple times and i have always really enjoyed my sandwich i have only tried their vegetarian sandwiches but i find them one of the most unique and flavourful sandwiches out there theyre not your typical grilled veggie sandwich like every other sandwich shop hasthey really put thought into them and they are always a treat the service is fast and friendly and there is a small patio you can enjoy in the summer","6055":"this place is excellent option for a quick lunch  you order at the front and get a number and they bring the food to you was very fast and very good  i ordered the whitebox club which was roasted turkey bacon jam swiss cheese avocado butter lettuce herb dressing toasted rustic white bread yum never heard of bacon jam but it was to die for  the sandwich was pretty big and i ate the whole thing because it was so good  they offer chips or slaw i opted for the slaw to give it a try it was a bit vinegary not my favorite  also comes with pickle chips  it was 10 for the sandwich a bit steep but well worth it  they offer gluten free options which includes gluten free bread  double plus there  check it out","6058":"this is the new hot spot at the westshore mall  i took some clients there for lunch last week  we beat the crowd by arriving at 1130 and were promptly seated and greeted    the complementary chips and salsa were very fresh and tasty  we all ordered their specialty fruit tea which was super refreshing  the three of us ordered the costillas al piquin which is boneless beef short ribs rajas crema tomatillochile piquin salsa  oh my  we were all in heaven  the meat was tender and flavorful and the sauce was so good    my only compliant is how the rice and beans were served even though they were great the rice and beans are served family style but the portion inside the bowls was what you would typically see for one person at most mexican restaurants  i got a table spoon of each  the service was quick and courteous and the server was knowledgeable about the menu  at the end of our meal she presented us each with a warm churro and a tiny good luck charm    its a bit pricey from what you typically see mexican for but its not typical mexican food either  i would recommend it for a nice evening out","6061":"6252014 convenient outlet of a local nashville bakery in southwest terminal c  pastries are def buttery somewhat flaky a little chewy probably did not benefit from being nuked really a disservice  prices higher than the bk down the hallway but quality of food def higher  coffee was adequate","6062":"the korean bbq taco was absolutely legit with solid teriyaki asian bbq flavor coupled with extreme tenderness tacos are small so definitely get two the salsa was some of the best ive ever had with a rich fresh flavor and the guacamole was just as good portions are very fair cool outdoor area for seating only reason i gave it a 4 is they lack any beer on tap i feel like this should be an absolute in a restaurant that sells salsa","6063":"very nice washington square west lunch choice went here with my son on a saturday our food was good and the portions were huge simple decor","6065":"i recently found out this place was right next to where i live so i had to try it first impression it has a cute out door area with heaters which is nice since its chilly outside in the mornings the inside is cozy and it kinda reminds me of a grandmas house me and my husband ordered iced lattes and a apple turnover to share i didnt like the iced latte because it lacked sweetener and sugar packets dont do the trick with iced drinks the apple turnover was good we also ordered chorizo burritos and they were pretty good too i got mine with a side of potatoes and my husband got a side of fruit overall it was a nice experience ","6066":"just had a delicious and very filling lunch at in riva  indoor and outdoor eating space with a view of the river  they have a familystyle type of menu with a number of small appetizers salads and then about 10 different types of gourmet pizzas  it was perfect for a business lunch and was an enjoyable interactive meal    we started with the meat and cheese plate appetizer choose your own meats and cheeses off of a selection of pairings and had the prosciutto salumi misti prosecco and sardo cheese  the waitress did a fantastic job of explaining what each ones texture and taste would be  we then all split the arugula and mushroom salad served in a house vinaigrette followed by two pizzas the broccoli misti and the prosciutto and arugula  wowwhat a delicious experience   definitely recommend this place  important to note however that if you are going all out things add up and this place gets pricey  you will also probably need a nap after they roll you out  still stuffed","6068":"nice selection of wine especially for this side of town   love the olive and soup bars sushi made daily but would steer away if not early in the day also has hot servings of chicken corn dogs potato wedges and other delights  decent deli with pretty tasty ceviche one of the butchers makes it fresh tends to have stuffed chicken and skewers for sale  nice bakery fresh breads daily with full cakes and pies try the jalape\u00f1o loaf","6070":"came here to get ciabatta rolls which were okay but not what i was expecting i usually think of ciabatta bread as having a chewy dense crust but the rolls were really soft and fluffy they were tasty and fresh but just not the textures that i was expecting what really surprised me though was the focaccia slices that they sell i ordered spicy tomato bread and the parmesan garlic both flavors blew me away the crust itself was chewy and crispy on the outside the spicy tomato sauce was really good with a slight kick to it but nothing too spicy the parmesan garlic was really satisfying with good umami flavors there were several other flavors to choose from and i regret only stopping at two i was going to pop them into my toaster oven to warm them up but i ended up eating them cold definitely worth a try for the focaccia bread at the very least im excited to try their other loaves as well","6074":"one of new ice stores start business recently near the university good taste and flavor and there are many kinds of fruits can be choose to add in your ice cream i will patronize next time","6081":"i had a chance to enjoy me some creole creamery on a late saturday afternoon it wasnt overly packed you should be able to find a table for 3 to 4 people to enjoy your deliciousness inside very nice family atmosphere to share some family time  the staff is very friendly and helpful they even let you try some flavors so you can make the best yummy choice i went with a rose ice cream that was yummy a little hint of wine and ice cream is what dreams are made of on a sugar cone which was only 3 bucks thats a big deal these days you get ice cream in new orleans you lucky some something less than 7  its surrounded by a coffee shopcafe restaurants etc so you can do a few things in the area before enjoying your ice cream  make sure too bring case because its cash only street parking area but you can find something within the 2 block radius","6083":"amazing coffee and great food get the grilled cheese with apple avocado and fennel but parking was nearly impossible and i couldnt get on wifi which defeated the purpose of me going there to work  a sign did say that theyre expanding the parking lot so that should make a big difference","6088":"fun lively atmosphere interesting variety of fellow diners hey daddy will you buy me a drink we are two 60s couples and have noticed the group of singles including many boomers at the bar we enjoy a crowded restaurant with energetic noise level we laugh a lot and fit in without calling attention to ourselves the early group is like being on a cruise ship and the crowd is younger as it gets later the al fresco area is great in the season","6091":"i just had the best pizza since i arrived to saint louis  it was chicago style  perfect pan crust  oozing mozzerella with pepperoni sausage bacon mushrooms and green peppers covered with tomatoes  we also had the chicken fettucini perfectly done pasta in a creamy garlic sauce with nicely charred chicken on top   we almost forgot to ask for the bread thanks for the tippatt c warm rosemary and pretzel rolls served with butter   great service clean  it lost a star for the whole cocos gone rat pack defunct casino vibe","6092":"i usually dont eat fried food but my friend said try something you dont get in chicago so i tried the soft shell crab it was so tender and juicy after dinner i had the home made peanut butter pie hands down the best pie ive ever had i promised the wait staff a great review here it is but dont take my word for it try it yourself","6099":"good place nice outdoor sitting area bbq was pretty good and service decent as well","6101":"i waited quite a while to try in riva and ill begin this review by saying it was worth the wait i waited to hear what others were saying i read reviews talked to friends who had been in the past all comments were coming back positive last night on the occasion of my forty first birthday i decided it was time to check it out for myself  we arrived early our reservation was for 8pm but we were seated immediately we were seated right inside the door which was uncomfortably cold but that isnt the fault of the staff or the establishment  our server immediately brought over a bowl of roasted chickpeas and pistachios which blew my mind so much so that ill be making them at home today to take to a superbowl party tomorrow  we ordered drinks the beer selection wasnt great but it had enough to satisfy i ordered a caraffe of bianco unusual for me but it was quite good  we started with an order of crispy artichokes from the antipasti menu they were piping hot and just bursting with flavor the lemon yogurt that they were served over complemented them perfectly for our pasta course we shared the pappardelle gnocchi and the fiondette all of which were very good but the gnocchi was the true standout here i can truly see that it will wake me up at night calling to me begging me to come have it again and again we also ordered a pizza i had a boss once who preached the word of potato pizza he swore that on his many trips to italy that potato pizza was a true italian pizza i found this very strange because the idea of a starch on a starch just seemed so redundant bullocks to that the potato and fontina pizza was just delicious there is no other word to describe its absolute perfection the crust was more like a freshly made mediterranean style flatbread than a crust crispy light and airy yet chewy all at the same time the toppings almost tasted like a twist on au grating potatoes sliced paper thin peppered with prosciutto leeks and fontina cheese there was a balance there that ive only ever noticed in thai food before a balance between earthy salty sweet and spicy all at the same time each bite was a trip to heaven  for desert we order the cannoli and the zeppole both were okay not really epic but okay  all in all id say in riva is a win for the east falls neighborhood and a great place the portions appeared small for the price but the quality was outstanding since i mentioned price i have to ad that i dont think it was overpriced im just not used to getting actual portion sized portions at a restaurant they were the perfect size enough to be satiated but not stuffed","6102":"we love this place we typically go in the summer and eat on the street the food is great and it is byob so bring yout tequila and have them mix an awesome pitcher of margharitas our  5 year old daughter loves the tilapia on the kids menu most days the owner also comes out to make small talk with us and to say hello to our daughters my husband always gets a kick out of that  i would like to see a bit more variety with the sides that come with the  fish  they generally serve it with a white rice and some boring veggie mixturethey also have an upstairs that we have seen people have small parties","6103":"first off this is the first sunday theyre open for businessso dont be deterred by the closed on sunday note  nice toppings good crust not thin but they did an extra crispy for us that worked  our only negative is that the sauce is quite sweet  if they can adjust that theyre a keeper","6104":"usually i am never disappointed by this ridiculous oldfashioned treat however i got a concrete this last time that i didnt like so much note to self always get what you want not what your husband wants hehe  its affordable its delicious and you feel swept back to the 50s when signs and menus were handwritten and people were friendlier","6109":"i bought a combo box with four strips  this is more than i expected  the sauce is amazing  i enjoyed every bite and you will too ","6110":"zorba the burger what a killer burger everything about it was delicious the service was great and the decor was cute popped in on a whim for lunch expecting to get a gyro they dont serve them but we didnt even care when they brought out the lamb burgers great food","6115":"so far i have not been too impressed with the food trucks in nashville so with no real expectations in mind i went over to the hot spot trailer while they were parked at turtle anarchy i had never heard of them before this so with the deer in the headlights look i approached cautiously the person behind the counter offered some suggestions their twisted chicken with jamaican jerk spice and asian hot sauce its sriracha i dont know why they dont mention it by name its like calling guinness irish stout from the st james brewery i dont think ive met someone who doesnt love sriracha so no need for euphemisms  anyway it was 7 for two big pieces of their chicken spiraled with sriracha and a separate container containing their fennel slaw ive been similarly unimpressed with hot chicken but once i sat back down at the bar and opened the container it was a flaky spicy but still tasty piece of chicken the hot chicken ive gotten was just heat but with very little flavor the chicken while sweat pouringly mouth burningly spicy was still really tasty i kept biting into it thinking oh man this is good while wiping my face on my sleeves careful to avoid rubbing my eyes with any heat the random smoothness of the sriracha with the spice in their batter was awesome their fennel slaw was also really tasty with plenty of fennel seed in the mix and it was basically the only thing that could keep the heat downtoo bad that there was so little of it  my friend came later and i got her the patty melt as a belated bday dinner she really seemed to like it and its probably the only thing on the menu that doesnt have spice on it he was even nice enough to walk it into the brewery when it was ready   he eventually left because of the lightning that came in me in a little metal box with lightning around im leaving and as my friend and i were thinking of eating again we told him how sad it was that he was wrapped up to go he gave us what he had left a huge basket of fries and three big pieces of chicken for free hes changed my mind about food trucks and hot chicken but more slaw please","6116":"i was very disappointed the cuban coffee not so buenoit would have been nice to have i good authentic cuban cafe con leche in this neck of the woods  food was tasty very clean good service friendly staff","6117":"this a a fantastic bakery  restaurant along a strip of many greek restaurants in tarpon springs  the food here was fresh tasty and just perfect after an afternoon on the ocean  i enjoyed the spanikopita tziki  pita and saganaki or better known as flaming cheesewhoopa   the pastries are yummy too  the baklava  wish i was there right now","6120":"location just opened and this was our first time ever at a red robin as packed as it was for lunch the wait was only about 15 minutes for 2 of us we were sat at a table barely a foot away from the table next to us  so the lack of privacy was a little uncomfortable  being vegetarians we were pleased that there were 2 different veggie burgers morningstar veggie or boca vegan that could be subbed on any burger i tried the just the regular veggie which had carmelized onions and zucchini on itdelicious  next time i will try subbing a veggie patty on one of the other burgers fries were also fresh and piping hot was a big portion so i had leftovers for dinner  maria was our server and was terrific especially given how busy it was overall  we thought it was a little pricey  cost us almost 40 for 1 appetizer 2 sodas 2 burgers and tip but we will be back since the food was good and it is difficult to find restaurants that have such great vegetarian optionswhich says a lot since this is a burger place ","6122":"i had the steak bowl and it was delicious  since its so new in our area the lines have been out the door so i recommend ordering on line which is very easy and you walk right up to get your food","6123":"you can get just about everything here great variety on teas seafood produce etc you can even pick up an electrical rice cooker they have a great line of brands better than other major department stores  md also sells cooked meals in the back of the store decent selection of pork duck among other dishes tried the duck found it a bit greasy and a bit tough very disappointing this may have been the one downside to md but still a great market great seafood and teas strongly recommend it  if i could make one suggestion it would for md to offer samples on the regular they have many items that look tempting and very appealing i always feel undecided about buying because ive never tried it just a thought","6129":"good food and boba especially the taro  service is straight to the point it is a small place very much a deli","6130":"we were a bit scared to order food here the place had some stale smell but we decided to be brace  order food anyway since we were starving  felt lazy to find another place ceviche is awesome would go there again burrito  quesadilla were good too very reasonable too good food  portion","6132":"everytime i have gone the service has been slow i guess it pays for the really always excellent veggie italian wrap they could lower some of the prices of the side items 299 for asian slaw that is maybe a cup size probably meets serving requirements but  seems to me like its marked up 250","6136":"i like this spot its a divey hole in the wall fried chicken joint they have some different combos to choose from and also offer a wide variety of treats read sweet potato pie i didnt have it but it looked amazing you receive your food in a box with some optional hot sauce opt for the hot sauce from there devour with your hands and lick them clean i should note there are a few metal tables outside so keep in mind seating is limited as a southerner skip the sweet tea it tasted like the bottled liptons stuff blech","6137":"i love trader joes  ive loved it in chicago i love it here love love love checking out dealson wine   my only i only comnplaint and why the negative one star is that there is no trader joes closer to downtown and both of the local once are equally as inconvenient to get to  i frequesntly buy cheese and wine here and their cocktail sauce is not bad not a fan of going on the weekends when it gets too crowded","6138":"went here for breakfast and then later on dessert that same night breakfast was really good and i loved he overall atmosphere we sat on the patio and enjoyed fantastic fresh fruit perfectly done eggs bacon and a very good cup of coffee my only negative to the breakfast was the limited menu since it was a weekday i went there to have the french toast i read about in other reviews but it wasnt on the weekday menu we returned at the end of the day to try the blondie dessert which was great maybe a little too sweet for me i will definitely return here if i am ever in stlouis again","6139":"long drivethru time but i am not going to blame the workers  i am going to blame the company for selling food that requires heating  the person who took my order was super pleasant and my coffee was hot and exactly as ordered  ive never had a bad beverage from this locationjust dont go if youre in a hurry","6140":"while sobeys isnt my go to for the majority of my grocery shopping i most definitely appreciate their meat and cheese deli areas and the customer service i receive when asking for suggestions or help in selecting items  there are usually samples available or if requested  the store is always clean and ive never had to wait more than 5 minutes to check out  they dont charge for bags  yay and they dont make you use a stupid discount card to get a club price which makes me bonkers  they have recently started awarding airmiles here if you collect them its worth grabing your flyer for the week to get the coupon for bonus airmiles  oh and you dont need a loonie for a cart  double yay","6141":"i went here with my boss a year ago the food was delicious service was great it was a little loud for our lunch but i would go back with friends i tell many pilotsi work at an airport to try it out for lunch and they have all loved it","6145":"gary husband and part of our dynamic eating triomom was out and about elsewhere and i turned up there you never know where well go next recently on a weekday night it was surprisingly busy as in nearlyallseatsweretaken kind of busy  we went in cold having no prior experience with freddys or their menu we found the menu a bit confusing what was the difference between a steakburger or a double burger etc we needed some descriptions but all we had to go on was a menu above our heads on the wall the cashier was a friendly young lady who did her best to answer a bunch of questions but we didnt want to hold up the line so we dove in and ordered a burger and a double steakburger combo  the lines moved very quickly we did manage to nab a table yahoo garys double steakburger came with a huge basket full of skinny and delicious fries plus a drink i did the a la carte burger glad i did so as there were plenty of fries for two of us the burger tasted delicious and i can guess that those burgers are the reason people return here   tip the burgers are skinny so go for the double burger so you get a healthy mouthful with each bite  we noticed the soda dispenser was well used and that there was a strange pile of ice in the drainage area like a mountain of ice we mustve come at a high usage time  i wouldve loved to have tried the custard dessert but given our luxurious audacious quantity of fries we opted out of any dessert for our own well being next timeand we will go again it was fun and friendly even though quite the busy place by the time we left the lines were to the door but as i said earlier moving fast","6146":"had an amazing time in new orleans and this hotel was part of the reason the rooms are clean and the garden is beautiful we especially loved the service we are looking forward to going back next year  special thanks to ms julie for finding a phone charger for my husband mr marlon for making sure my gluten free toast was ready every morning for breakfast and mr larry charles for all his help throughout or stay they made out stay very special","6147":"had some of the rolled ice cream was absolutely delicious very creamy and you get to pick 3 toppings cute little place nice seating to enjoy what you ordered  they have the boba drinks as well served in plastic light bulbs which is fun also when you go in they had sticky notes and a sharpie to be able to leave a not or your mark posted on the wall","6150":"affordable prices and good food we have always had good service and food  this time the kitchen messed something up which can happen in every kitchen from time to time  they made good on their error  we will continue to go here weekly with our family","6151":"food was very good tried the cioppino fried calamari and other fish and the crab cakes real good but a bit bland if you are looking for a full blown flavor experience not much room to sit around and a long looooong wait bring a jacket in december","6154":"medium in size this wawa is the one i opt for at lunch over the one on belmont ave  slightly more parking spots and easier to get into and out of but just as crowded in the morning times and at lunch","6155":"stopped by one day and ordered their tampa cuban sandwich  best cuban ive ever had and ive had my share","6156":"this is a great jewish deli there is a diverse menu and huge portion youll always have enough for a second meal we always make sure to stop when were in the area","6157":"when i first visited indianapolis to apartment hunt before i moved here i stumbled across this coffee shop this place was so charming i immediately decided to live in broad ripple knowing nothing else about the area turns out living near chic coffee shops is probably always a good idea  the furniture that looks like it came from your living room mixed and the local art for sale on the wall is charming the baristas are incredibly friendly prices for frilly drinks are lower than more corporate coffee shops hubbard and cravens starbucks ect  coffee is selfserve just drop your cash into a slot and pour yourself a cup personally this is a huge bonus for me it builds a lot of rapport between me and a business if the owners dont assume ill rob them of 2 worth of coffee if theyre only stupid enough to give me the chance  overall monon is one of many fantastic coffee shops in indy the lower prices for lattes around 350 for a 16 ounce make it better than most for frilly drinks and the selfserve coffees are excellent its probably worth noting that monon doesnt really do flavored coffees or at least not at the self serve if youre into that youll probably want to head somewhere else","6160":"best tex mex in the metro ive tried them all love all the chicken disheshard tacosbean dip salsa is yummy","6162":"hellas is our regular  favorite greek spot in tampa bay   the atmosphere is fun  with the restaurant decorated in bright white and blue decor   service is good and friendly   love the grilled octopus  greek salad  saganaki flaming cheese  mousaka  and grilled kebabs   save room for dessert  their bakery next door is a must try with a huge variety of traditional sweets opa","6166":"looking for old fashion diner food complete with the old tunes and diner atmosphere here is a place to go the food is good and the milk shakes are the right way  with ice cream we went as a group of eight and everybody enjoyed their meals  the service was attentive and if you ask for keith from san diego for service you wont be sorry rock on johnny rockets","6171":"the beers is good here but my favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere converted industrial space large open air in the summer food trucks live music right in the heart of the city great service too","6174":"this whole foods location opened up a couple months ago but it is not new to the main line   another whole foods was located about 2 minutes down wynnewood avenue however that location had horrible parking as it was shared with some local businesses like sang kee and dakota pizza the location was also on the smaller side causing overcrowding also it was a bit old   by moving to the new bigger location they believed they were fixing those issues they addressed the problem head on they fixed most but i am not sure they fixed them all   first they built an indoor and outdoor parking lot however these are always packed and it is always a struggle to find a parking spot when it is very crowded workers have to direct traffic one time a small fight broke out the traffic pattern can be confusing as well   other than that there are no real glaring issues about this location compared to the last location this store is much bigger cleaner and has a much better and healthier variety  for example the carts here are xl a full size tavern and beer garden are downstairs and a juice and smoothie bar is available they have also expanded upon the salad bar sushi bar pizza kitchen and bakery  food wise i absolutely love this stores hoagies their seasonal thanksgiving feast hoagie is off the charts they have a somewhat healthy candy bar which has amazing fruit snacks finally their salad bar is delicious with so many options from types of lettuce to dressing to croutons
