if you decide to eat here just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end we have tried it multiple times because i want to like it i have been to its other locations in nj and never had a bad experience   the food is good but it takes a very long time to come out the waitstaff is very young but usually pleasant we have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting we usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends in order to be done quickerupland is a brewery based out of bloomington indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central indiana  all of their beers are very good and i am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins  therefore i was excited to try their pizza but i dont think it ended up being on par with these other items  my margherita pizza had a crackerlike crust and was pretty light overall  the cheese was good but none of the other toppings added much flavor  there was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza  my opinion is that uplands pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group but ill be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visitsmy food only merited maybe two stars but i will give an extra star because i like the menu and will try more of it and their design and concept  sadly though my tomatobasil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp offputting flavor  it was citrusy for sure and i love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering  i think next time i will focus on the dishes with cured italian meats mortadella and prosciutto  and also the baked goods those sounded pretty good especially the nutella bruschettaa couple friends and i stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at more than just ice cream well we just got ice creamnot fully taking advantage of what the name implies but maybe next time  3 milkshakes 1 coffee 1 chocolate and 1 blackwhite malt   all were pretty good definitely satisfied the ice cream craving i thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker same goes for the chocolate the blackwhite was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three unfortunately i did not order that one so i settled for my not so creamy coffee  i did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake i tried the pumpkin pie which was amazing i dont know why i didnt just get this maybe a milkshake isnt the way to go herethis is a pretty good pancake place but its a little disorganized in the way its run when its really busy the pancakes are pretty good but super sweet so you have to be in there good price point serves breakfast all day so thats definitely a plus but not anything particularly special that you couldnt get anywhere elseaverage or slightly above despite the hype  on the expensive side  for 10 or 12 you should get fries with your burger not a large to share for 8  i had a bison burger that was the only reason i went there  seems we had 1 beer 1 iced tea 1 burger 1 bison burger and split a large fry for about 37  rather ridiculous and they try to hard to be different or interesting but ruin a good meal  the bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and bbq on it to call it a carolina bison burger  not worth 12 on its own  been there  done that  no reason to go back  nextso much to like about this placethe beautiful mercer building location the spaciousness the lovely friendly baristas but there are a couple of important cons for me biggest being the music is constant and too loud ruining everything you go to a coffee shop to do read work reflect or enjoy a good conversation when i asked for it to be turned down they told me they cantit just plays at one level all the time and the speakers  are everywhere so you cant get away from it it sucks  secondly if youre a tea drinker youre out of luck they dont serve the tea in pots but huge sloppy individual filtersit makes your beverage totally ungainly hard to drink and is really off putting  pros gluten free goodies and yummy italian sodas id love to spend more time here but the music usually drives me out after 10 minuteswent on a sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there  we sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items  no worries we just wanted a couple of beers  we sampled several varieties all of which were average  nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried  unfortunately  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late  i get it but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear  kind of put a damper on things  cool location and cool place but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near byits my first time here and the service is slow the employees dont have good attitude but the food its gooddefinitely get in line before 830am we waited about 30 minutes pancakes were fine my friends got the raspberry pancakes the sweet potato pancakes and the san antonio i got the sugar and spice pancakes all were well and fine a bit dry i dont understand the hype but if the line isnt too long its not bad for normal breakfast food if the line is longer i would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to fido  insanely good coffee and great breakfast foodawesome location good service is why i have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on mostly the excuses about the steak is why i have to write the review i am happy to pay more for good quality steak but dont blame the poor guy that sold it to you food is good but the cafe itself is extremely dirty i will probably not return unless they clean the place upwe have big group of 12 for the office outing lunch i would said for the number of people we have the service is not the best but good enough only one of our members get the food late the close out may need to work on it tip was added since we have large group which may my bill easy   i have order the lamb kebab shish kebab plate it come with two choices of side i got the rice and the babaghanoush the rice was well cook and nice aroma the babaghanoush was well prepared and great with extra olive oil the presentation of the dish is pleasant however the meat did not measured up it was too dry and the marinated is not over the top they need to improve on this area   i have been here several time my previous experience is better during the month of ramadan they serve the buffet that are plenty of choices and attractive i would said try them during this time the buffet of ramadan usually start at 830 go early because is a lot of customersi was looking forward to a new coffee spot but this wont be it for me  they dont have a menu first off and im not a coffee connoisseur so i was a little thrown off  i kept it simple asked for an iced tea but they did give me hot tea wa cup of ice  v artsy crowd here great for people watching but not for studying  its a little loud my headphones were not enough to block out the noise so i was stuck listening to watever they chose which wasnt my preference  the servers were all really nice and they kept cleaning the tables quite often  all in all it wasnt a bad experience but not one to keep me coming back eitherwe went on a friday night and the place was full but even so there was only a 20 minute wait  the service was  hit and miss i dont want to rip on our server too much because our server was obviously trying but just not hitting the mark the food was ok but i dont believe ill be back it just wasnt greati have been a loyal customer at magasin cafe for years its what made me fall in love with vietnamese food since magasin cafe has closerd for renovations i came to magasin kitcheb to curb my weekly pho cravings the food and service were good even the chopped was seasoned better than the other location however paying more money for the same meal and the restaurants atmosphere deters the ranking quality food and service will continue to keep me a loyal customertina i believe was our waitress im not sure if i want to give 3 or 4 stars its just that the initial wait was kinda long but it was my first time eating the food and i thought it was pretty good i liked my side salad toothe beef noodles was a bit too salty and the fried rice was a bit oily but overall they are good we liked the shrimp spring rolls a lot it is one of the best we have tried   the place could have earned higher points but i have to give it a three stars because of the chaotic seating arrangement the owner gave tables to people behind us despite we reminded the him and the staff perhaps that is what you get when you go to a teeny tiny chinese restaurant during a long weekendi stopped at walgreens in hopes of seeing the new elf villains collection sometimes walgreens gets them before the holidays sometimes they dont this particular one doesnt ever get them according to their cosmetics person sad really sad i suppose ill have to skulk other walgreens to find themi have frequented the mad mex university city location for years  i was pleased to see this new location which is closer to my home and i dont have to deal with the obnoxious students  i have been here for happy hour and just for dinner at another time  it has been busy both times and it seems that the staff need to be trained a little more in chaos and crowd management  the best deals are during happy hour  the 3 5  7 margaritas  i also believe wings are 12 off  my friends seemed to enjoy their orders of burritos gaucamole and enchiladas    the food is average and for the price of drinks  it would be a great place to hang if the service improveswhile i generally support independent restaurants over chain placesi still dont buy into the overpriced center city phila hype the place was actually roomier than the south philly closets we usually take my mother in law for her birthdaybut the prices were jaw droppingquite different from the online menu the food and portions were okand the dessert was something different than the average places the bus help was a bit out of sync with the waiteras they were asking us if we were done with our plates just as the waiter was telling us the dessertsand as the philly standard the bathroom was a bit small to accomodate the size of the placei had chicken bbq burritos with all kinds of stuff that i like i love the it  good place to sit down with family  had a meal i wish they had a place for kids to play that would be even better came here with a group of 15 people on a tuesday night we had reserved a space in advance  while the food was good what was lacking was good service and cleanliness we sat down at our table and it was sticky and there was a dirty and also sticky fork still on itso the assumption was that the table simply hadnt been wiped down all the way yuck  we ordered and the food took a fair amount of time understandable because of such a large party problem was when the food came out no server knew what wed individually ordered so it became a huge mix up with people eating others food  i ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside i also ordered the spicy beef pho which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes  the wait for the check and processing payment was long and arduous a problem again because we had a lyft driver waiting outside for us  all in all go for the food not for the servicefor a seafood restaurant at the edge of pear expectations should be set high my wife and i have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time this last time we ordered cioppino clam chowder and a crab salad sandwich good  clam chowder excellent flavor and consistency would order again not great  cioppino lacked flavor  a variety of sea foodlack there of would not order again pass  crab salad sandwich lacked flavor mayo was overpowering crab flavor was almost nonexistent side of onion rings too greasy  would not order again  the overall experience is okay better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean inside is very small service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated  is it worth a visit yes but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and missi find it hugely ironic that wf is trying to reposition itself as a value food store right now when others ie trader joes up the street have been doing that for years  for value go elsewhere  for pretty food lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness check out whole foods  despite my snark i have to admit that its nice to see an enormous clean and well stocked yuppie market in reno finally  now that this town has been rated by national geographic as a top outdoors place to live in it needs the retail to support that and i dont mean another rei  for myself im too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs but for lunch and the odd stopover its awesome   beautiful produce drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if i bought everything that struck my fancy  plus its proximity to the freeway for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80 makes it an ideal stop tofrom the airportmonthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from fresh and had it delivered   my selection was the chopped italian salad the salad consists of mixed greens salami smoked turkey tomato garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette the salad was lacking for me i think such a salad would be so much better with a few more italianesque ingredients in it perhaps a little more anitpasto like i know its not advertised as antipasto but cmonthis salad was boring  throw in a couple of olives some artichoke hearts some sliced pepperoncinis maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasnt very flavorful either charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad please  i do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing maybe i need to stick with a panini or something but i really do love salads for summer lunchesdecent falafel wrapbut not exactly cheap and the cavelike sitting area was cold and uninviting there are better choices in manayunkdecent frozen yogurt with a lot of options for toppings they have about 8 different froyo flavors to chose from lots of possible combinations however it can get expensive pretty quickly when you weigh the cup   theres not a lot of seating inside staff is friendly but not very active i do want to try their bubble tea but j wasnt very impressedby 3 stars i really mean 35  white brick walls cool rustic furniture seasoned attractive employees and the lighting is lovely nay perfect probably good for a blind date  and service is good and timely  but 35 couldve been 4 if it wasnt so expensive for what im getting and if the kitchen was more accommodating  the first time i ever ate there around when it first opened i ordered ravioli and received 3 or 5 pieces for 1113  another time i visited i tried substituting a salad for fries with my burger and my server said no sorry the kitchen wont do that   are you er kidding me it wasnt a super modification its not as if i asked for a burger with only one bun no tomato half piece of lettuce two onion rings and love it wasnt like i wanted to substitute lobster for fries needless to say this is the first time ive been unable to substitute im usually really easy to please but this is the first time ive ever felt difficult at least in my head is this in my head  unforgivablegreat birthday cakesi mean it   but the cupcakes and cookies out front tend to be stale at timesalthough when i have complained they made good on everything    i will go backi only go here when i need something that trader joes doesnt carry they are overpriced and understaffed not a fanive only eaten at cosi when i travel ive eaten at this location a few times i like their flatbreads and salads  there bbq chicken flatbread is good its a pretty good portion size toolove the tap room but i cant seem to get the hours of business right  my first visit was a kinda a let down  i had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in indianapolis but i only found 2 that i liked and only 1 was memorable  however bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps i like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer   the tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area  i only gave them 3stars this time but i look forward to improving their score after future visitsthe food is delicious but the service has always been pretty slow if not bad which would be understandable if it was busy its just usually its not great breakfast fare and all eggs provenale was pretty good all kinds of herbs and seasonings but cooked inconsistently tomato on the side was awesome  omelets were executed well and the pastries were pretty impressive  but the coffee was horrendously bad and without good coffee whats the point of breakfast  and i still cant trust restaurants that have misspellings on their menus even if the misspelling is from another languagepretty good bagels be sure to ask for extra cream cheese if you like a lot the people are always pleasant which is unique to dunedin the bad thing is the guy doesnt wash his hands or wear gloves he took a previous customers money my money  used the phone and wiped his nose then he made my bagel i wont go back if this doesnt bother you the bagels are pretty goodstill running on est we arrived 830 on a saturday to find no wait to be seated or helped ordering up the sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup good topped with excellent with some borderline awful hash browns really people cant say id return even without a wait though would prefer to just buy a jar of the syrup and apply it at home ended up at 2443 pretip no paper towels in the restroom and the day had barely started so that was probably a dogshowice cream wasnt the best and definitely not for the price but it was there when i was passing through belmawr and it hit the spot when i needed to satisfy my sweet tooth   the service was friendly albeit a little slow and the place has a cute quaint charm about it with the decor if i lived in the area id probably return but i wouldnt make any special trips to go back hereplease note the coffee is excellent however you have to ask for cream and sugar i find this pretentious and intimidating its coffee i want it how i want it it shouldnt be such a big dealneat diner unlike other diners as its quaint and has a good feel to it i had the yankee pot roastwhich was okmashed potatoes were just ok and the meat was kind of bland the veggies were excellent fresh not out of a can  my wife had an omelette which she said was good service was excellentcheap food and large selection unfortunately they forgot our order we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it bad customer servicewell i did visit here a year ago long before the ecoli  colliform scare so i have not been back out of concern for my health and safety darn shame too as i really did like this place but i must admit that i still am not confident they have their act in order my suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165f temp serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead and only source their greens and veggies from usa only sources avoid mexico as they have big issues with water pollution crosscontaminationplace for latest night eats around and drive through is a must new menu items and some veggie options etc forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so i was very bummed when i noticed far too latewe visited this place because of its location on the wharf and because my husband loves seafood its tiny but we were there on a tuesday evening and only had to wait a few minutes we ended up sitting at the bar it would have been a longer wait for a table outside since there are so few because of its size its a little noisy but not bad the service was very good my husband had the crab sandwich and wasnt impressed its served on very uninspiring white bread i had the fried shrimp and enjoyed it very much it was not greasy or heavy and the shrimp was moist and tasty there is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu so the nonseafood enthusiast me was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much plus good onion rings but the seafood enthusiast my husband didnt love the crab sandwich if we tried this place again he would order something else the location is awesome so if you like shellfish definitely give this place a tryit is what you expect in an acme the only thing i found a little different with this one is that it seemed the aisles were a little narrower than in other stores store is a little smaller than others so not as wide of a variety but was fine looks like theyve upgraded some areas like the frozenrefrigerated food sections service was finecant go wrong with some todd cobellneeds some attention in the dining room good salad  but skimpy on the bread no sweet tea   i noticed a booth with children almost be for at least 30 minutes one was a sleep finally an employee came out to them she must have brought to work with her i was concerned because they were small  aloneive been to mount laurels on the border over 50 times i used to go to don pablos but i fell in love with on the borders chips and salsa their chips are nice and salty and their salsa is a little spicier  when i go 90 of the time i just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa the beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too  when i do dine i often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides lately ive grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas which i find delicious service when dining is usually great  as for the bartenders its really hitormiss joann is probably my favorite shes friendly attentive funny and ive really gotten to know her and id give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone there is a bartender named nikki though and if shes there i always get the worst service she barely checks on meus to see how were doing she seems unfriendly if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking when i was done and trying to leave and ive had to wait forever to ask her for my check at least twice ive had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that i could finally close out and leave id give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone  overall good appetizers cold beer moderate prices and usually good servicedelicious food subpar service i stopped into this dessert bar today to grab some dessert and a coffee togo while everyone seemed to be very helpful or at least wanting to be im not sure i received the best possible service i ordered two slices of cake one marshmallow chocolate and one cheesecake both were delicious but it seemed like i waited forever to receive these and when i did it was in a cute but inefficient manner the togo boxes were stacked one on top of the other with a loosely tied string around them while i admire the aesthetics here i would have much preferred a bag though the worst part of my experience was the barista i ordered an iced coffee with milk and sugar first he put ice in the cup and filled it halfway with coffee he then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated i wouldnt know what and how much you want i only drink my coffee black as i considered this incompetent statement i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve but no he proceeded to fill the rest of the half of the cup with milk and then handing me the drink he told me id better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in not sure why id paid such a high price to practically make my own halfcoffee halfmild beverage i simply smiled and walked away i ended up throwing out the drink as i could hardly even taste the coffee and im not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee nonetheless the cakes were delicious and i will be coming back with the hopes that this new business is still in the process of improving itselfbigger than the rittenhouse location  theres actually street parking server was super friendly and happy to tell me her favorites got a taste of the groothie and im glad i did because it was too sweet for me the udon noodle salad was greati think i wouldve given this place a 45 star rating if not for the lackluster service and attitude the entrees were good the prices were spot on and the breadsticks were delicious  ahh the breadsticks this is where the attitude part kicks in these things are advertised as as much as you want for free however my buddy heads up to the front counter to request enough for our table of three only to be given a hard time from the manager that were eating more breadsticks than what we ordered give me a break dont advertise what you dont want to deliver  even ordering was a chore it seemed as if they had a new hire manning the register during the lunch hour rush she was placing orders as togo for people looking to dinein and had to have the manager place orders for her not a good idea for a friday lunch rush  if this fazolis location can improve upon these things minor inconveniences itd be a great place to grab a quick bitethe food was pretty tasty nothing outstanding though it reminds me of any mediterranean food truck that ive been to its a nice late night spot definitely hits the spot at the end of the night to me the amount of food you get for the price could be improved but i would not say that i feel ripped off the amount of food you get is fair but i think itd be easier to justify if you got a little more   theres plenty of seating despite being near a whole bunch of barclub scenes once youre inside its easy to take a break and have a nice conversation it is all very clean and well kept the servers are quick and friendly when i went there were only two guys working but they werent busy so it didnt take too long the entire restaurant is very dimly lit and the atmosphere is a bit of a hodgepodge of things on one wall there is a mural of outer space and the music that plays seems to have no rhyme or reason to it   its a bit of a strange place but i would definitely go backcousins is the place to go if you live in north philly i take this joint any day over fresh grocer   the only complaints i have is with the produce which is expected considering it is cousins after all and the hours like many others have said they have awful and inconvenient hours post5pm  that being said i can get most essentials here and for much cheaper than anywhere else   this is only a two minute bike ride from my apartment so theres no reason not to shop here matter of fact im headed there tomorrow  when its too cold or youre feeling to cheap to go to trader joes cousins is the place to head tothis is actually a 3 12 star review for me only because everything that i wanted they did not have or werent willing to do firstly i came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when i told the lady taking my order she said they dont do that  then i wanted that buttermilk bites and they werent available however my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that oh yes and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry i liked the sliders i had though fried chicken beef belly and catfishokay and the sundae is pretty tasty good for a first try but not to continue comingatmosphere is adorable 5 stars and location is outstanding 5 stars but since food is likely why you would venture to a restaurant they get an overall rating of 3  got a smoked turkey club and it was mostly good loved that it came with 2 sides the meat just wasnt awesome the creamed spinach was good but the mac n cheese was kind of dry and bland disappointing since it was an upcharge not giving up on this place yet im determined to go back and try something else because i want to love itif you want beignets in metarie for my money morning call is better than this shop  if youre dead set on cafe du monde youre only twenty minutes including parking to decaturgood on the getting away from straws for environmental reasons not so good on ingredients in ur mixers not so impressed with bar girlzzzz energy saturday eve her margarita getz 2 thumbs down  itz kind of an easy drinkworn down signs intrigue me  i had biked passed 16th street seafood a ton of times always wondering what was going on inside  now i know the answer and the answer is not much at least in terms of decor there is a gumball machine 2 empty candy machines plus a counter to order at and thats pretty much it also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood there were some frozen crab cakes breaded fish fillets clams and crabs but not else still i threw caution to the winds of tasker street and put in an order  i didnt want to go for fried seafood so the sandwiches and platters were out  i got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce 950 mussels are one of those things i like making at home but it is way too hot for that right now  my main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells  9   it was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy broth as the place is togo only they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders nothing was spilled  remember when i said i didnt want anything fried well thats not ever actually true so i ended up sneaking in 2 fried shrimps not bad but not worth 125 eachedit 712 ive since been and for sure have changed my opinion again as i said below i think i caught them on a bad day 3rd time was a charm for me if i get a hankering for some good greek  med food ill check it out  oh and to the reply from the vendor no my first review wasnt a joke my opinions still stand from my initial visit however since i went back i even tried bubble tea for that alone im a huuuuuuuuuuuuuge fan   short and not sweet  avoid this place maybe i just got them on a bad day but suffice to say nothing was good sauce sucked lettuce brown long wait  expensive and just dry and tasteless gyros should be savory and moist sorry i wont be visiting againpretty average barrestaurant with the menu offerings you can expect from a place like this the food was ok and the service was excellentthe food here is tasty  love the brisket and the cheese grits but  we have had terrible luck with take out tried it three times and an item was missing every time a disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restauranti like to make a stop at this walmart since its located in meadowlark where my doctors office is  its smaller than  the supercentre but i find it has a decent selection of items in the food section where the prices are cheaper than the nearby stores  the produce section can have limited items though with just the basics in stock  i find the snacks and canned food section are fine with good prices  as for the rest of the store and items well its hit or miss  i was looking for lightbulbs and they only had one brand of the type i was looking for and it was a energy efficient so pricier than others if they had in stock  however the price i paid for the item was probably cheaper than other stores    dont expect much help if you need help finding an item  associates seem to be difficult to find unless you count some of the younger staff who like racing shopping carts in the store as they were on my last visit    the check outs can have at most 5 cashiers working but i find the time in the line ups is never too long so thats goodjohnny rockets is on the pricey side you arent getting outta here with a burger and fries for any less than 10 bucks and thats without a drink the burgers are 67 bucks and definitely solid for the price though i had the route 66 13 pound nice soft potato roll meat good and lean pretty damn tasty and satisfying wish i could say the same about the friesrings i tried the mix but theyre the standard freezer bag affair and the fries are actually subpar dry and not much flavor worse than most fast food fries the onion rings were better but of course they cost almost twice as much  ill be back to try more burgers but would suggest just sticking to the burger or cheesesteak with no sides maybe grab a shake for dessert instead  the basic hot dog at 3 also costs about the same as an order of friesok beer ok food we like breweries because we have a kid and like beer so we go to a lot of breweries the service was excellent food beer goodchicken was awesome loved the char and the garlic marinade i cant say the same for the rest of the meal rice was cold but flavorful and probably would have tasted better if it was warm and dryer the hummus was average and the falafel was just awful im arab so i know my fair share of felafel this was not even acceptable in my standards for america everything was fresh though which is why i gave it a 3  epic chicken not worth the wait and the possible risk of being yelled at too much hype for just the experience  ps if you want real falafel and epic hummus walk down the street to mamasthis place is solid  the fleur de liis omelette makes my day  i can also get a mocha and kick back  i recently took a friend here and she thought it was slow but hell shes not from the big easy slow down is the key to enjoying life  huge portions and brightly lit fast paced slow moving but good solid breakfastservers were attentive but pizza took over 30 minutes and that seemed to be the average for any order volcano buffalo pizza was pretty tasty celery on a pizza who knewi know i know silly as it seems i have not had the pizza here  but i did get a tortilla soup and 12 a mediterranean salad  the soup was really yummy with a sprinkle of cilantro and avocado on top    the salad was more eh i think the dressing that comes with it is too salty    but i am looking to go back for the pizza  hopefully they can make a cheeseless oneits a crazy place with surprisingly good service decent food and the weirdo clientele you would expect in this area im really enjoying this little family reunion with the deadbeat drunk father oj and the crazy white guy in the corner and his random outburstsdidnt care for this place we shared the big easy breakfast and it was okay the food was barely warm and the whole meal was eh except for the pancakes the pancakes were good wouldve tasted better if they were warmer  the hot chocolate was good thick chocolate and it came in a togo cup which was convenient the service was also good we arrived on a friday morning around 815 am and there was no wait but it was starting to fill up by the time we left there were a few people waiting outsidealthough the chicken is always very good there was a sulky male employee on sunday jan 1 with a pussface putting my package together 16 pc grilled chicken meal  out in the open he was complaining about work  honestly if he doesnt like working there or the pay the manager should allow him to make a decision change his attitude or leave  this doesnt leave customers with a positive feeling about the place especially when he didnt load all that was supposed to be in my order  wheres the rollsbiscuits  pay attention it doesnt cost anythingstarbucksso arent they all just clones  a review would be futile if youve already visited one before  coffee is ok  its more like coffee flavored water to me but does the trick when called upon  i much prefer some home brewed new orleans style coffee  chicory  chicory makes the coffee starbuckathons have no clue what real coffee is liketheir pizza was ok i think they need to cook the pizzas alittle more and have more tastier cheese they do have a large delivery area in southern tampa as well as yborgreat atmosphere above average burgers but super cool drink selection  both alcoholic and non alcoholic  they have pretty much every kind of soda style you can think of and some really tasty spiked shakes  definitely a fun place to be at no matter what youre feelingvisited last night with a group of six ambiance and service was excellent theyve done a great job with the space the salsa and table side guacamole are very good however the three stars are attributed to less than spectacular entrees that are slightly over priced for mexican food and everyone in our group had drinks that were all consistently weak ie tasted like less than an ounce of alcohol i would give 35 stars if possible but i see this as a second or third option in the tampa area for mexican cuisinegood downtown breakfast stop great service food wasnt exactly perfect but i tend to be hard to please in these regards i hear lunch is really good alsook this is an aberration from my city foodie reviews but i figured ill take the time and review some of the local establishments that i order from on a consistent base while working in bensalem pa  without further adieu georges chix is good  im always satisfied with the food and value each and every time  i havent branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me im not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu usually i get the nuggetfriessoda deal the chix fingersfriessoda deal or ceasar wrapfriessoda deal 8 or 9 after a nice tip but the food is alright give georges a try if youre in town and looking to get down on some fried grubthis is a great place to visit if you enjoy large crowds and overspending  they have plenty of delicious deli and bakery items available but you generally cant see either case over crowds while you wait and if you dont know your order immediately when your numbers called you are sol they will very quickly call the next person in line so my advice would be to arrive the second they open so that you actually stand a chance of seeing the cases  its a great place for extroverts but its very small and very very full of people so if youre the type of person who is not into that sort of thing i would probably try to go in the most nonpeak hours you canwe went on a friday evening around 530 and were seated outside on the covered patio right away we ordered 2 apps and a flight the chorizo nachos were huge and decent but the trout dip with pita bread chips is what stood out the dip came out with 6 pieces of bread placed in a circle around the dip i asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what it was free score  since both items were appetizers they came out in a matter of 5 minutes all around it was a wonderful experience with good weather great service good food and a flight with information about each beerif youre a fan of sweets this spot is worth visiting  theyre wellknown for their pralines but there are plenty of other desserts to choose from here  they even have guys in the front or back of the store making pralines that you can watchwawa is what it is a convenient store that has an array of options  the prices are reasonable their food is only okay though ive had their sandwiches a few times my biggest gripe is i do not like their tomatoes i think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard i could be wrong about the reason but they are hard nonetheless  they also have a few premade hot items the hot dogs are okay but its hard to mess up a hot dog they hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average cheap and quick but so not worth it  go hear for a candy bar drink or other package snack item dont go here for anything thats actually prepared by them its just not that goodgood beer much better than most beer made in stl sweet if you love sweet   ambiance is sterile no vibe looks like an office building destination spotgreat food and drinks albeit overpriced i had the salt of the earth cocktail and it had great flavor the angry chicken chicken taco was good but one wasnt very filling we had the shiitake lemon and cauliflower pizza as an appetizer and it had good flavor as wellthe service was great and everything definitely tasted very fresh i especially liked the guacamole  i tried the mole and mango chicken tacos and i felt they lacked just a little bit of flavor ill definitely go back though and try some different varietiespanda express is like going to a jiffy lube  you know there are much better places and your leery about going to either but you still do because its so quick and easy  panda express is ok and i love how they have the little stickers on the serving line swearing they use no msg  but you wonder why you bloat up after eating there   believe it not i dont have any complaints about panda express i think its great its just one of those places where if you choose to go here and its not good all you can do is slap yourself and ask yourself what did you really expect and go about your day   one thing for sure  its is really quick and thats perfect when your in a hurryi have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night simply the beer is just ok i love good beer but i will drink it whether i think it is amazing or awful i got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler batch 100 winter warmer undead black ipa and paramount they were decent nothing to write home about or come back the next day for the reason they lose points from last night was because of the food not the beer  got a black and blue burger it had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries the price is steep for their higher end food but i think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time  ps for anyone looking to avoid big parties babies and young kids 112 years old i have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant not much you can do about it besides sitting at the barill go back got a lb of brisket and a lb of pulled pork both were very very yummy im shorting them stars for the sides though at the risk of sounding full of myself my mac and cheese is better also their burnt end beans were too heavy on the mustard for me my kids dug their shoe string fries ill definitely go back for the meat maybe ill give the coleslaw a tryim from stl and sadly i never had ted drewes until recently i always see long lines so i figured id give it a try i went to the location on south grand and the ice was good but the service was terrible the staff was rude and impatient while i tried to figure out what i wanted maybe ill try the one on hampton next timesecond time to visit mazarin in three years  three years ago it was great including the breakfast    but this last visit dec 2016 not too good  i never got an answer to three phone calls previous to the visit  three different days and three different times of day so i emailed to request courtyard view  my superior bedroom was facing the courtyard but it did not view the courtyard  i was put on the third floor which viewed  the top of a tarp that covered the courtyard during inclement weather  only the weather was not inclement  i suppose they were too tired to remove tarp  they are very busy never got answer to email either  we booked the room for two people and had to request two wash clothes each day since there were none  the concierge never looked up from her pc to welcome guests and it would look better if she would smile she probably wasnt feeling well  doorman was great and the desk service was prompt  the breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this price point  it seemed cooked hours previously then placed on steam trays  similar to what is served in la quinta  eggs were scrambled and stiff bacon was limp and chewy and all the breads were stale and cold  juice and coffee were fine  we stayed three days but only ate breakfast there the first  even though breakfast cost was included in the room cost  hint to cooks if you keep scrambled eggs on steam trays they continue to cook and become over done  also breads bagels and croissants are baked fresh daily in the quarter  it would be good to serve it  on the better side the rooms were very clean and when the drain in the shower was slow leaving us standing in an inch of water they sent maintenance man right away and repaired it  slept well every night  i am sorry but we will not be staying a third time and cannot recommend this hotel as a 4 or 5 star hotelsmall menu seems like a neighborhood diner atmosphere we had the biscuits and gravy and the slinger which comes with sausage instead of hamburger iced coffee is truly just black coffee served over large chunks of ice food was good but nothing was great very small dining room with family style communal seating first time trying but probably wont be backim going to make the bold statement and say that im kind of an ice cream fanatic whenever i get ready for a trip researching ice cream shops is at the top of my todo list i dont care if its the dead of winter you take coffee breaks i take ice cream breaks i realize that i take this obsessionaddiction to an unhealthy extreme as ive been known to eat it for dinner   with that said you can imagine that i was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp when reading the reviews i was convinced that creole creamery was going to be the birite of the south best ice cream ive ever had i had some pretty high expectations unfortunately it did not deliver quite like i thought it would but it certainly wasnt bad   my main problem is that out of the 3 flavors i had they all tasted identical i got the basil coconut  lavender and my sister got the rose these were some of the most unique flavors they offered and youd think theyd be pretty distinguishable from one another alas neither of us could taste much difference the flavors were extremely subtle  what i did love however was the creaminess and texture this is where it gets close to the birite status the ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency you simply cant buy something like this in the store had the flavors wowed me i would have given this 5 stars hands down and it truly would have become the birite of the south in my book  all in all i will definitely go back i mean its still great ice cream and im sure if i tried a more traditional flavor the taste would be stronger i just really love the weird stuff its a local deli prices are high but that is the normal deal for places like this they dont always put prices on their stuff which is sometimes annoying  i go here often because it is close all the employees are very friendly and they always pet my dogtotally agree with the other lone and 1st review the staffing at this store is dysfunctional and the merchandising is poor at best   and to make matters worse many of the centerstore packaged product prices are not competitive to other merchants in the area  there are some perks if you live nearby its of course convenience  the other nice perk is that lancaster brand steaks are very good and at this acme theyre always fresh good grill cuts and they are very reasonably priceda great place for breakfast  the parking situation is a little difficult with them only having a small area for cars i dont live nearby so its always a task to get a good space the times ive gone early in the morning it has been a little hectic and crowded i will say  the food is delicious the coffee is better than most ie starbucks duncan donuts  its a cut above the restlove this place with the vibrant colors on a sunday morning after a night out we loved the bloody mary bar however they were out of almost everything and they didnt replace our waitress was not with it we have 8 people and it was about a 2 hour trip 30 min of that was her just trying to figure out the bills credit cards and payments it was baddecent place for lunch overall service is good with friendly employeeswas in town looking for breakfast places and this place had a super high rating  im pretty picky when it comes to ordering biscuits and gravy because i like the way i make them  lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper  i gave it a try  the sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice  i didnt enjoy the biscuits  they were very hard and smothering them in gravy didnt help much  i also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign  it was a bit pricy  all in all pretty goodlove their juice double burgers with bacon and cheese their new location at la cumbre plaza offer even better burgerscustomer service is where its at look at this place decent lunch and breakfast food i mean it all tastes great but its just basic stuff nothing different from the trucks on campus except one thing richie hes the man hes made himself a local celebrity on campus with his great attitude and awesome service im telling you hes a genius because why do i choose to come here over any other place on campus richie of courseexperienced this restaurant 8042013 with friends we decided to sit in the courtyard which had a lovely ambiance however the the square table for four was much more suited to a table for two really felt cramped  the wines we chose were really good we had the cabernet sauvignon and our friend had the malbec which she really enjoyed  for dinner i chose the salmone campagnolo the mash potatoes were great however the salmon was definately overcooked and very dry and lacked flavor everyone else chose the saltimbocca which was also nothing special have had better on the hill   visited august 2013if you want to get in and out quick this kfctaco bell is ok for a fast food place    i went with my brother early evening and got two hot wing boxes  the chicken wings were a little over cooked and overpriced  i wouldnt say you get a great value for portion sizes  the hours are not late at this location  the few times i have been here the food hasnt so been great either overall customer service is pretty good    go here if youre having a craving for either taco bell or kfc    xoxothis is the best pizza by far in reno crisp crust and loaded with toppings it was amazingmaybe ill write an updated review bc i really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place i wasnt that impressed i got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries which didnt even taste in season i should have tried some of their other flavors maybe next timei miss mexically but if you cant make the trekwait in line for don memos then this is a decent option  most recently i had the chicken tostada  it was a ton of food but it didnt wow me  the flavors are kind of bland  i wish they didnt charge for guacamole  its cheap quick mexican style foodi ordered the combo vermicelli and was pretty disappointed the meat portion was very small compared to the huge portion of rice noodle they gave me make it look like theres a lot of food the combo cake with 2 bland shrimp 1 eggroll and a few pieces of marinated beef i also ordered an iced viet coffee which was pretty decent it wasnt as strong as the ones you would get from 626 or oc area however its pretty good coming from sb i think they diluted the flavor a bit as well overall i would come back for their viet coffee but not for their main coursesuper cute place came during lunch and i had the fig salad and it was really good although id probably ask for the dressing on the side next time since it was a bit much for me would definitely go again for another day datefast food style greek food  i would bet most of the 4 or 5 stars are from late night college students after a few drinks  i would not be afraid to return for lunch as it is quick clean priced right and the food was solid  however i have had much better gyros and fries  everyone talked about the wings and the staff said they were great so maybe next time i will go that route and update the reviewwe are still fans of taco bus over casita it was evening when we arrived and casita taqueria had a few customers we were met with smiles and a very cheerful charming staff  they explained the menu to us and we were left to order  my wife ordered a shrimp casitas bowl and i had the carne asada taco and the barbacoa taco  the meal came out fast and well we werent blown away at all  i had been waiting for months to come here to the best taco place in st pete but i was disappointed  my tacos flavors were muddled and colorless while the hot sauce was missing that wow factor as well  the shrimp casitas bowl was just ok per my wifes review and it too was just missing that something   so for service you guys are awesome  but for the flavor we just needed that over the top nextlevel umami type of mexican that we have been exposed to latelythis was my first time but my dining companion has been before and pointed out a few changes i had the portobello stuffed pretzel and he had the black bean burger both were fine our complaint was with the sides the options were ruffles or store bought pasta salad my companion said they used to have sweet potato fries so he was really disappointed since thats why we came i think well stick to stopping in for a drink and skip eating thereonly good thing about this place are the fries the burgers are not that special or great ordered the double mushroom and got more mushrooms than burger patty almost reminds me of a mcdonalds burger patty even with 2 patties the burger felt mediocre at best greasy mushrooms and a soggy bun came out to 12 with drink and fries and still felt hungry afterwards if you want a real burger and fries try a true authentic local placeacme in flourtown is good for a small local grocery store its clean has a fairly decent layout and selection and the staff is pretty good if youre looking to grab something quick its the best option close by the genuardis in flourtown and acme in ft washington both kinda suck  however if youre looking to do some heavy stocking up grocery shopping youre probably better off heading somewhere elsenot bad not bad  went there for lunch and liked the variety of spice levels  also liked that the lunch buffet did not have too many mediocre things but rather had a dozen well made dishes in smaller batches  service was above average and cleanliness is next to excellentmy husband and i have been here a number of times and the food is typical beach eatery  i always enjoyed the food today  however the  platter i ordered was pretty bad crab cake  not much crab was lukewarm and mushy scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry nothing was hot  not going back anytime soon server was very nice thoughthe good plush beds huge flat screen tv nice toiletries and great location very nice staff  the bad the hotel was under renovation so there was construction outside and tarps making a nice courtyard look like a junkyard we got stuck in the 3rd world country wing  i think bc we got a cheap rate where the air system was loud and obnoxious and the wifi was broken we had to take an elevator then a stair case to our room the breakfast everyone raves about is quite mediocre compared to a spread places like the intercontinental and other upscale hotels put together35 stars  hubs and i decided to stop in this place after driving past it on several occasions  i am very glad we did because we find all kinds of deals here  granted we sometimes overshop because of low prices but with the savings we are actually breaking even  how do i know prices are good  well i am one of those people that for whatever reason tends to memorize prices from my other grocery retailers whether i want to or not  for example a 20 ounce red bull here is 240 while the exact same thing at another store is in the 450 range    just this past weekend we bought a keurig k300 for 8080  the same item retailed for over 100 at several other places nearby  so why just 35 stars if i am saving money and am now flush with cash  well the downside is that unlike a typical grocery chain you cannot necessarily find all the brands you are looking for when shopping  that makes it inevitable that i have to make a trip to a separate store if i have specific needs which cannot be met at iga  but i do start my shopping here to get what i can before i go to round two  the employees are helpful the place is neat and clean and the prices rock  sarcasm  im never flush with cashwe may have visited on an off day tacos and gauc were good but no comparison to funky taco 15 for a cold glass of the only cab sauv on the menu was disappointing seriously that much for a glass of wine  mushroom taco that said was a mix of many mushrooms was all portobellos with one shiitake mushroom not ok great setting but need to refine quality blackened fish taco had no blackening might try again maybeone of the best places on washington avenue to sit outside and relax  a very relaxing atmosphere both inside and out with service to match  we enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions   one of the best features of blondies is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous blondies is a nice oasis away from all of this   food and drink blondies offers an above average list of wines by the glass and some very nice beer selections  i enjoyed several red wines a cava and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits  they also offer a limited menu of smaller plates charcuterie and the likes from which i have not ordered  given their offerings im sure these are quite nice  also a very nice feature is their 4 wine nights on wednesdays which is always a plus  we will definitely be back in the future3 stars means i like it and ill be back for more i love cuban food  i lived in tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of cuban food im excited to have another cuban place here in indy there arent many   when i think of good cuban food i think of cuban bread yucca plantains pork and cafe con lechejust to name a few  today we got the cuban sandwich and the plantains they were both really good the portion size of the sandwich was huge it could easily be shared the pork and ham were good  there were two big misses the biggest miss is the bread its just not right it was almost the consistency of a cracker it wasnt bad but all of the cuban bread ive ever eaten was much better even if its pressed ive never had crackerlike cuban bread  cuban bread is something that i would order as a side i love it so much this bread missed the mark  maybe i missed it but there was no yucca on the menu i really love good cuban yucca that was the other missmet a friend for dinner there about 5pm based on his recommendation  we tried some of the craft beer  the porter was very good  ordered dinner ribs and brisket combination  the brisket was moist and held together well but not too fatty  the ribs were flavorful as well  what was disappointing though was the portion size  my friend and i both almost simultaneously mentioned how small the serving size was for the price our server was prompt attentive and friendly will i go back next time im in town  probably  but next time ill try lunch and a sandwichdrexelpenn student joint good for a quick swing in for takeout or a buffet plate nothing to write home about reasonable prices and qualityincredible wine and booze selections clean and organized sadly the produce was terrible bad oranges and peaches in florida that was disappointingvery overpriced for literally half a panini incredibly disappointed wont be back forty bucks for me and the kids and even the kids were still hungrytruly delicious and generouslysized burgers the fries are superbgreat pub food the prices are a little steep the service is fine my goto spot to dine and talk for hours and its never been too busy where that would be an issue99 of the time i love whole foods this week and last week though i am quite disappointed we drive a distance to come to shop here so we always eat from the salad bar two weeks in a row there is no vegan salad dressing available they usually have 4 vegan options last week i didnt discover that they were out until after i had made my salad when i asked about it the gentleman said were out til monday  he didnt seem concerned or offer any alternatives so i gave him my salad and left  this week still no salad dressing but i looked before i made my salad and i purchased my own vegan dressing come on whole foods please dont disappoint me againi really want to love this place but they make it so hard the past three times in a row ive been there there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever i was with super annoyed  starting with the good the coffee is delicious the assortment of baked goods is greatquiche is yummy etc ive always loved the spacegood mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops plenty of outdoor seating on nice days  the prices aresteep but i always feel good about supporting a local small business so whatever my real problem is the tude and just general lack of professionalism that ive seen from the baristas they clearly know their coffee and thats great but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month  purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar my mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a heads up his answer yeah were actually out of half and half everyone stared blankly at him including the other people in line now mind you it was before noon not five minutes before they closed no apology no im so sorry we sent someone down the street to the 711 literally down the street to pick some up they should be back any minute that was it the guy behind us asked is anyone going to get some more and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us ummmmmm as my mom said when you charge people 8 for two coffees one of which was just a drip coffee i dont think its too much to ask that you provide half and half at your coffee shop   another time i was there a friend asked for her coffee extra hot and then when it arrived just warm she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute she was very nice about it the girl behind the counter on the other hand felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they actually cant put the coffee cups in the microwave for some reason i now forget and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water uhhhh homegirl could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem put it in a to go cup and microwave it this doesnt seem like that hard of a problem to solve nor can i imagine its the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot again everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened   this is a small thing but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board but then half of them apparently only come in one size i know its a small issue but youd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they dont have to keep telling people last time i was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me   jersey java owners please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service again they know their coffee and theyre generally nice until theres any sort of minor hiccup and then all basic common sense goes right out the window your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time i go there oh and buy more half and halfit was okdid like the homemade potato chips had to wait 10 mins after asking for the check as the waitress was talking with other guess but food was goodits ok but as someone from texas that knows her barbecue this will not be a place that i return to its pricey for what it is and its just not that great the service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome but if youre looking for authentic barbecue at averagemarket price this isnt it this is more of a barbecue style of their own and its pricey it has a cool location and the service is friendly and promptslownot as amazing the last few times i have been  the tomatoes are still excellent the fruit still the same and the ideas still fresh  but sometimes there are a stale lettuce pieces in the salad and it can be like sitdownandreadabook times still a great choice but i think the sheer traffic from the groupon or whatever with one or two staff only can lead me to not be quite as delighted as before  still good as a local coffee placelook i like the place and featured donuts did not disappoint  but lets be honest with a line like that how does a selfie happen  huh  st louis  huh  strange donuts  i find that a little unusual and now my near perfect selfiefoursquare check in ratio has been irreconcilably tarnished so im taking a star off because selfie in the age of mark zuckerberg in the age of obama youre gonna have a shop too crowded to take a decent selfie  paleese  also they have no paleogluten free options so another star off i mean what the hell am i supposed to feed my four and six year oldif you want anything fresh you gotta come here early or else youre going to find yourself waiting for the pastries to bake or just have none at all  im very bad with the names of pastries but i can say that i definitely like the guava turnover bearclaw almond croissant and ham and cheese croissant  i wish they had more savoury pastries actually i wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit   i had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work later on in the day i would grab a loaf of bread that i would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast i wish the bakery was open later but unfortunately none of the bakeries in new orleans are open late and by late i mean past 1 or 2 pm   that being said the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and i would give this place more stars if it wasnt for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers i have been frequenting maple street patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions i have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient even when theres no one else in the store or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate  at other times the workers are actually pretty nice  so please if youre having a bad day dont take it out on the customers  if you want coffee i would go across the street to starbucks or down the road to pjs but if you dont mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakerynot bad prices are very reasonable service is friendly this place works like a subway you go in pick a size and start adding ingredients which you can see sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than youd think based on just looking at them that being said a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl or seeking munchies elsewherethe selection is pretty good the prices are outrageous as one would expect what i wasnt expecting was to see vegan jerky right at the entrance how is that even possible better yet why would this place even try to sell that crap   they also have quite a few different fish options which also seems weird salmon and swordfish are good soft why dehydrate them  my biggest gripe is they dont offer samples i get that jerky is expensive but theyd probably make it more enticing to buy if they let you try itim really very impressed with the selection here im not nearly as impressed with the price but where else can you get such a huge selection of foreign beer theres not just your usual belgians and germans either i was happy to find japanese russian and even some lithuanian and polish bottles to choose from there are even some quebec based brews you can find here du de ciel sticks out that i havent found elsewhere in the philly area  ill be back just for the selection alone you wont find anywhere with more inventory in the surrounding areas ill cringe when i see the high price but try to remind myself its worth ittoday i tried the red velvet and chocolate peppermint cupcakes  frosting was very yummy however cake was rather dry  would expect more from cupcakes that are 375 each  slightly disappointedi like yelp for this very reason new place decent buzz needed to try it myself that said i feel its an ok start to a place that has potential my biggest concern is that the dishes are small also a bit on the pricey side i had the cauliflower pizza it was good but waaaaaay too small for 8 i had the zoodles which was a greek salad made out of zucchini noodles it was good but pricey at 8 as well i feel this place could be good over time but it felt sort of i dont knowrushed add more food for the money or drop the prices at least 1 across the boardmeh it didnt blow my mind but it was okay  i think some of the meats were overdone  the filet mignon was not tender  the ribs were very tender and that was about it  they could have done better on differing the rubs and the meats were not diverse as some brazilian that i have had  luckily we didnt know about the special running and it wasnt really expensive otherwise i would have gone to two starsthe donuts are nice but nothing out of extraordinary  i just ordered two simple donuts  one chicken sandwich  they are really tiny  and black ice coffee  plain and paid 15  cold brew costs 325   that is more expensive then starbucks charges for plain black coffee  again coffee is ok  they charging 175 for one plain donut and 275 for fancy donuts  way too overpriced for a donut joint  and the atmosphere and cleaning of the shop is not aligned with the prices they charge nice location great food selections and good coffee had the french toast it was pretty tasty overall good experience and friendly staffno complaints as far as taco bells go terrible for you and terribly delicious this place is my fast food kryptonite   the service here is quick  friendly and theyve never screwed up my order which is more than i can say for other taco bell locationsi have been in this store twice  it is clean uncluttered and seems to have a wide variety of products the clerks and service people need to work on smiling they seem a little grim and preoccupied also items i was shopping for were not clearly priced and the deli only had 2 sizes of containers i think there is great potential but things need to come togetheri was here on a recent weekend in st louis  its good yes but so is culvers  i wouldnt go out of my way to go here sorryi know everybody seems to love this place but both times ive gotten attitude on trying to order simple things i e an iced green tea i basically ended up making it myself maybe im being a princess but how difficult is it to make an iced green tea   i really would love to love this place but no wifi what id park myself here regularly to work if they had wifi  yes that means i would be eating  sipping the whole timei had actually never been to a mb prior to this experience but ill keep it short and sweet it was fine i got an average sandwich with minimal expectations knowing i was at a chain i ordered egg white and turkey bacon on a pumpernickel bagel with a large coffee everything came out quick and was fine it fit the bill for my morning my major complaint would be that the coffee was just warm which i loathe the guy at the counter also looked super stressed out and annoyed even though there werent really a lot of people to deal with id hate to see what hed be like during a busy morning i wouldnt go back but it wasnt a terrible experiencefound this place on yelp and came to try to since it was walking distance from circus circus  waitress was friendly and we were seated after a 10 min wait  we ordered the popcorn chicken and pork cutlet bento  both were a little under seasoned for our taste  the pork was also dry  the peach tea was deliciousgood bbq  definitely more of an upscale type of bbqribs were the best choiceim a winglover so i decided to eat here recently in short the wings were fine nothing special nothing bad or great o wing plus is a bit different from all the others the wings are fried and then soaked in sauce to me i wouldnt even call it sauce on most of them it was more like oil grease or the like they didnt taste too bad the parmesan wings didnt taste as good as they looked but it was soso for me on my three visits there i had the ten wings combo with fries and drink the supposedly hot wings werent as spicy sorry guys ive had better the crinkle cut fries were alright as well i did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate which brings me to a point this is probably the first wing place that i visited that doesnt offer dipping sauce like ranch and bluecheese but i got by plus i had the blasting top 40 music to keep me less bored all in all it was aoki  drove  by  this  restaurant  last  night  what  a  fun   brightly  lit  neighborhood  i  hope  to  return  and  eat  here  looks  like  florida  has  some  great  new  nightlife hidden  somewhere  between  ybor  city  and  downtown  tampai originally gave bgood a 4 star review and it was basically if youre in the market for a burger salad or kalequinoa bowl thats made with real  notprocessed ingredients go to bgood i also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didnt have hfcs or artificial ingredients i was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster being quite pricey for what you get  i have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because bgood is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy depending on whos serving you though and yes i know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as im concerned theres no reason why you should have to do online ordering for fast food  as far as im concerned bgood is trying to market themselves as real fast food the food is real but its definitely not fast and i dont know if it warrants the prices theyre charging with the service they provide that and considering how there are so many awesomesimilar eateries in that shopping center already like zoes kitchen chipotle  panera bread its hard for me to keep bgood at a 4 starok so this is my favorite resturant but the staff is so immature i want to have a date night and get away from crazy teens but thats exactly what i get with the servers get some people in there that need the jobs and will take them seriousya wanna get crunked no problem buy a 16oz of the finest malts for 119thats about 75cents an ounce best bang for yo bill good location lots of homiesbrown bag to stardomgood customer service great manager louder than most micjy ds good iced coffee like the app buy 1 get one for a pennyfirst time i came here two months ago it was decent and the chicken com tam plate was good the pho was good too but when i came here today it wasnt close to being as good it was actually pretty bad inconsistent i guesswe ordered take out and ate by the ocean on the pier food was kind of pricey and not enough for the priceany breakfast place that i can remember six months after ive been there ispretty much every breakfast place what do you think i am some guy who cant remember breakfast places how often do you think i eat breakfast somewhere other than my house so often that i cant even recall where it was  come on moons yes i remember moons they had a glutenfree something and i ordered it  see nailed itberry sweet just opened today august 21 2010 the folks behind it seem nice enough and the place really looks like every frozen yogurt place youve ever been to i think they want to just jump on the lets make a lot of money by selling something everyone already loves bandwagon however isnt that what makes america so great   leaving that aside the place was just recently renovated so its bright and beautifully clean kind of like a phileo knock off and since theyre a pinkberry knock off see the trend but its aesthetically appealing and closer to my apartment so far be it for me to be too critical well i probably still will  my 2 complaints 1 i think its actually ice cream they are serving today so they need to look up what is actually frozen yogurt because yes there is a differnent 2 toppings  seriously lacking   however again living across the street from it ill give it another try and well see how that pans outgood selection of donuts a lot of very sweet donuts sliders are good donuts are average service excellent cinnamon roll tasted just like cinnabon with less frosting it needed more cinnamonmy lunch included a small portion of jerk chicken collard greens and apparently cabbage  i wanted mac and cheese  cabbage sounds nothing like macncheese  anyway after my initial shock and disappointment when i opened the container i started digging into the chicken  portions are very big and the chicken fell off the bone and was juicy  i love jamaican food and get the cuisine in any city i visit so i was a bit disappointed by their chicken  it wasnt bad just not very flavorful or memorable  collard greens and cabbage ugh were the same story  for 8 plus tip i was expecting something much more especially after all the great reviews i did notice the customers ahead of me ordered chicken wings so maybe ill try that the next time    i cant imagine a worst place to be then in a food truck during a heat wave so i will say that the service was very friendly by the ladyhad lunch at carrabbas yesterday and if it werent for the attentiveness and professionalism of the bartenders we would never return to this establishment we waited over an hour and a half for food and asked to speak with a manger maybe 20 times during the entire experience needless to say he never came over jen and marcus handled everything perfectly which is the only reason im rating this place 3 stars it was happy hour and they kept us entertained and in good spirits while we waited forever to eat when the food finally arrived everything was delicious marcus recommended the johnny with fettuccine alfredo and it was excellent my wife also enjoyed the johnny rocco salad we would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is new orleans there are plenty of place to enjoy good food take care of your guesti love the decorations here ive been here a few times most recently i went with my father to try the croissants and lavender latte the lavender latte was way too sweet i liked the lavender taste but the extreme sweetness ruined it it was still too sweet after i diluted it with water so i threw the drink away  the croissants were okay too dense for my taste they had good flavor and somehow tasted better the day after i liked the stuffing of the spinach feta croissant but the croissant itself was too dense and not buttery the ham and cheese croissant was delicious the nutella croissant was okay good flavor but the croissant was hard and didnt have enough filling the butter croissant was too dense with texture more like a bread roll rather than a flaky croissant the almond croissant lacked flavor  in the past ive ordered a green tea latte that i hated it just wasnt a flavor that fit my preferences and a mocha that was goodthere was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen eat some meatloaf and take in my ipod playlist on the speakers  its changed considerably  i dont know if the food quality dropped with the economy but even their burgers are failing  the only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries  it was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor just like char is supposed to taste  their oysters are good if youre lucky enough to get there on a west coast day but even then they seem to get the small batches   a real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters  a real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that   oh and who took the doughnuts  really  of all the dessert items you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce  for shame im hoping that as the winter rolls closer well see the meatloaf again with mushy peas and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up  for now meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait stafffood is pretty good always busy police have to direct traffic every now and then if you go i recommend the sandwichmy revisit update offers the same rating for different reasons  this is still a pretty expensive burger placemaybe get rid of one of the guys and lower the price 20    the burgers are real good and the toppings make it super delicious  on this visit my bacon cheeseburger was somewhat baconlessit had three small chips of bacon like it was the last pieces left  apparently visiting after dinner is a nonogreat waffles  chicken as good or better than roscoes i found the service to be great coming back for the live musici had heard the food here was great so we made a trek to the city to try it out first of all it was very clean and had a nice dining area the waitress was very nice and really understood the menu the salad and pizza were awesome the portions were large and the price was reasonable  i knew it was family owned so you never know what to expect sometimes family owned is like going to someones house and eating in their kitchen the negatives the draft beer tappers were broken and not fixed because too expensive according to staff the toilet was leaking in the rest room they had a bucket under it that only caught half the water leading to about an inch of standing water on the floor we were the only people there for the hour we visited the staff of about 56 who all appeared to be family hung out in the front watching tv my review incredible food at a good price with good service i dont know why its an empty restaurant on a saturday evening but like a family homerestaurant you take the chance of being a guest in their home that needs a little work and hanging out with family members thats what a family restaurant is ill be backgiant chewy chocolate chip cookie ice cream and a working cow brand ice cream with whip cream and hot fudge for 950 ok price for a really delicious treat by all means a cheap dessert to split on a date for two if you want ice cream and dont mind a hole in the wall type of location  serious cookie sits between a bar to the left and other shops in the right in a pink clearwater downtown building  the ice cream shop was not as kept as i believe it could have been and the gentleman running it was decent enough at greeting and explaining what he had left to offer us on a late sunday night but didnt seem happy to be there to say the least i wouldnt blame him hes a grown man in an ice cream shop unless hes the owner  ice creamcookiehot fudge 4 stars needed more ice cream  atmosphere 2 stars  customer service 3 stars  ultimately id try another ice cream joint before revisiting this one if i were a beer drinker this place would get one more star however judging on food alone it was aok the portabella mushroom sandwich was juicy but it really bothered me that i could smell the fermented wheat from the brewery attached the smell was very strong and overwhelming   however it was fun to see the brewery in action an additional plus is the weekend farmers market that is set up on their parking lot but their produce is a bit high for a farmers marketso i finally have a chance to try this place out after reading many many positive reviews on yelp and on facebook for a tuesday morning we waited about 2030 minutes no line at 12 pm there were 3 of us and we all were so excited since its our first time here i ordered the sweet potato pancakes with a side of hash brown one of my friends ordered the rash berry pancakes  which he complained was way too sweet the other ordered pig in the blanket pancake wrapped around a sausage which she ended up eating the sausages only the pancakes were very average and plain definitely not as good as what people said it to be hashbrowns were average also personally i prefer hashbrowns at bongo java the portions are huge and i recommend sharing it with someone   for that amount of waiting time and mediocre food i wouldnt come back unless im around the area not worth waiting at all  201342very expensive  1000 for a 4 steak sandwich chips and a drink wtf  the service wasnt that good  the two female employees behind the counter werent friendly  smile sometimes  if you dont like your job then quit   all that being said the sandwich was very good  just a bit of sticker shockjust order a few things for take out the people doing take out were amazing very friendly even though it was crazy busy i popped over to the bar for a drink while i waited and ordered a gin and tonic the girl gives me one without a lime which i then ask her for she gives me a couple in a glass and i squeeze them and ask her for a napkin she wasnt super friendlyreally for 8 you would think they would finish making the drink for you  food and take out service 45 stars bar 2 starsi love zaxbys but this location needs a lot of work i saw an employee struggling to get in due to being late and once i pulled up to the drive thru i waited more than 5 minutes to be answered and i waited another 57 minutes for my food it was a little bit ridiculous and not at all worth itgreat rotating draft list  good pizzas salads wings  all around pretty solid menu  gets very busy during happy hours games and weekendsservice was great but food was under seasoned and bland  this was our second time and the food did not deliver unfortunatelyvery liberal portions for some dishes scanty for others that are the same price   nice branding  decent number of options  several fancy coffeetype drinks  nice if you have a sweettooth theres a lot of gelato and sweet crepe options  maybe 12 or 23 savory to sweet optionsdont get me wrong the donuts were delicious but i thought the process was extremely difficult when you go to a make your own donut joint you go for the experience and their clip board was not doing it for me the amount of items on the clipboard seemed overwhelming and i was instantly confused i was also extremely disappointed that you could only get one topping i was really excited to let my almost two year old load up his donut as a special treat come to find out he could only add sprinkles the donuts were tasty but in my opinion it isnt worth a drive the experience just didnt do it for metook awhile for me to get service from the people working because they were busy talking in the back so that made me kinda annoyed but other then that it was a good mealnothing really specialcame here and was delighted to see nothing but taiwanese people authenticity  server asked if i wanted the taiwanese menu i asked for the english menu and went with  braised beef noodle soup 355  recommended by server  chewy noodles beef was lean and tender soup had nice touch of star anise but nothing special though  scallion pancakes 455  delicious  it was nice and crispy on the outside and had a soft chewy texture on the inside  paired well with the dipping sauce  crispy pork roll 155  disappointing  the pork was off it was a meat mixture that was flavorless  popcorn chicken 45  can never go wrong ordering this anywhere  the basil was awesome great portion  schezuan eggplant 35  tasted awesome but was way too oily  was not spicy as i thought it would be  overall it was just average  there is not a lot of places to eat that is close by to the casino that i know of  i just wanted to try something new and opted for restaurants outside the casino for a changei tried the cronuts a few weeks ago and they were bomb very very good too bad when i actually preordered some they turned out to be crap dried and hard not good at all wait in line for the 2 that you are able to purchase at least they are fresh do not preorder as for cakes i have not tried yet but it is on my listi stopped in here friday evening with my boyfriend dan it was chilly out and we wanted something hot to warm our empty bellies my first impression of this place was that it was oddly set up the drink station was pushed back into a corner and the food prep area seemed bigger than it needed to be the restaurant appeared to be very clean and the staff was friendly we ordered two grinder combos i had the spicy chicken and dan had the chicken cordon bleu both combos came with a medium drink and a bag of chips i think our total was around 16 after we ordered we were told to have a seat and our food would be brought out to us we grabbed our drinks and some chips and waited somewhere between 810 minutes before we received our grinders this annoyed me a bit but it was probably because i was so hungry well my annoyance quickly disappeared when i took the first bite our grinders were hot the cheese was melty and the flavors were great this was much better than and toasted sub at subway or quiznos i will definitely be backthis walgreens is in a great location off veterans and is very clean the downside is that theyre always understsffed no one mans the photo area so you normally have to wait for someone to finish with a line of customers or wait for someone to come from the back pharmacy is not as bad but expect to wait in line to check outstopped in for morning coffee  this is one of the new prototypes very new clean and sparkling  service was friendly with a smile  food is bk you know what to expectfriendly staff but disappointed in what i got my grilled cheeses bread was burnt for 6 and 48 because i used my credit card i was expecting betterquaint cozy and clean the boudin aint boudin in the traditional sense the hard brown rice chewy casing and under seasoned pork lacking any hint of cajun seasoning was way off the mark  the saving grace was the beef and onion over coconut rice the cordial ownercook and nice renevation of the spacestopped by for cheesecake with no one in line and was ignored by three people before one of them finally acknowledged me got the turtle cheesecake the cheesecake itself was okay the toppings along with it made it better these are really like cheesecake sundaes i shouldve gotten a regular size the large was two servings worthordered a kobe burger with wild boar bacon and cheddar the burger was good but not cooked correctly i ordered the burger rare but it was raw it could have used another 3 minutes on the grill  the truffle fries were very well flavored with truffle oil but were a little soggyunder cooked  the place was very busy and they got the food out quickly but i would have waited another 5 minutes to correct the problems above  also the floor was wet and very slippery walk with caution since it was the end of the night the place was a little dirty the tables and floor could have been wiped downthe donut selection today was not the best after seeing all of their instagram posts i was looking for more a selection they had 3 different ones that contained peanut butter and another 2 that had banana in it i ended up getting the neapolitan which contained chocolate pudding inside and had strawberry powder on the outside it was delicious but not worth the 4 in my opiniongreat concept decent healthy food but portions are off i ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich minus the bun and had the veggies while they gave me a generous helping of veggies the piece of chicken might have been 3 oz what a rip off i can get more meat at other places and have it be the same price most likely wont be back unless its to try a smoothie or get a vegetarian dishsurprisingly good bit expensive though california roll was mediocre however the spicy tuna roll crunch roll shrimp and hamachi were pretty goodi have to say being a regular customer of rouses there is a big improvement in the customer service since it was savacenter there are the cashiers that will look at you like you are crazy if you try to make conversation with them then there are the regulars that are actually nice i went yesterday and had a cashier that was completely mute and i loved hearing the bag boy mention how he hoped no one else would get in line so he could get a break i do have to say the managers are great the tall bearded wine guy is always helpful and there is this one short guy thats always gathering grocery carts that will ask if you need help loading groceries that is always niceis it worth waiting in line for probably not  lifechanging no  but if theres no real wait and youve got nothing else planned that afternoon and can take the siesta necessary to digest all the carbs you should go the sweet potato pancakes are really good but if youre looking for something less sweet more savory order the cornmeal cakes if you want an omlet head next door to jacksonsthe salad was very good pizza was excellent the 805 keg blow during my pour and they didnt have a replacement but they were very accommodating and gave me a stella great customer serviceoh whole foods how i loathe you yet somehow i cant resist going here at least once every two weeks first of all i will say that ive only eaten from their hotfood island or whatever you call it once because it was so bland yet so expensive that i never wanted to try anything else they offer having said that i must say that their seafood soups are quite tasty especially the lobster bisque but they are also so astronomically priced that i can rarely afford to indulge the only time when i buy something at whole foods is when its on sale or from their bargain cheese bin which everyone should check out if they go here great deals actually one star is just for the bargain cheese bin without that it would definitely only get twoi would love to give cyranos 4 stars but something really rubbed me the wrong way there on my last trip so i had to go for 3  more below  i wasnt very hungry so i decided just to have the hummus with pita appetizer  wow  big portion  there was easily enough there for two people and it was delicious  it tasted like there might be some roasted red peppers added in but im not sure    now my friend ordered the burger and the waiter told him they dont cook it below medium well wtf  seriously  i dont even remember the excuse but it was really lame  he ordered it anyway and then wished he hadnt since it had no pink at all  the fries were good but very mcdonaldslike  the desserts were truly delicious  my friend had a wonderful float made with abita root beer and i had the bread pudding which was so light and fluffy  really good     ill probably come back and update this review because the desserts can probably overcome the stupid burger policyyes remedy is home to my favourite chai has conveniently late hours and some mean vegan selections but thats about it   this joint is crowded too loud to make conversation always has a dirty bathroom and theres nothing too particularly endearing and homie about it  also a little overdone with people out on first dates which is indeed hilarious for peoplewatchingreasons to go here 1 good location within other nearby stores 2 descent food compared to other inexpensive fast food restaurants in the area 3 staff seems friendly enough 4 seems clean  i have only been here once this experience may be an anomaly    reasons to avoid 1 t888s love to eat here jk terminators dont eat  that would be stupidvery slow service  was 10 min after we sat down for anyone to come to the table to do anything other then bringing us water and papadum noone seemed to care we were here to there favor they are busy and the food is food not sure it was worth an hour from time we ordered to getting the food to the tablei used to love pizza mizza something happened the past couple of years the pizza is a a little thinner a few less toppings and things like the kids eat for a dollar special is not really a full kids meal nor is is 100 179 i keep going because the service is always great the location is good and the half price pizza deal used to be good not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in managementnice brunch spot while visiting with our son for wustl parents weekend  strada too salty for great ingredients to reveal their flavor but bananas foster french toast was enjoyed by all  coffee was fairwalked for what felt like an eternity down to the wharf because my bf claimed to have had the best clam chowder in his life here ohemgee he was right best clam chowder ever we also got the coconut shrimp and the shrimp ceviche these plates were meh the ceviche wasnt a true ceviche since the shrimp wasnt actually cooked in lime it felt more like a salad coconut shrimp was better but the accompanying fries and coleslaw was below averagei like the ambiance and the decor of this coffee shop a lot but im not a big fan of their coffee drinks the drinks themselves are very pretty they do some sort of art on top of the foam but the taste is just alright i ordered a soy latte and it already came sweet i dont like sugar or sweetness in my drinks and regularly a soy latte wouldnt come sweet unless i ask for syrup or add sugar also their drinks arnt hot enough both mine and my boyfriends hot beverages were just slightly warm im sure theyre fresh as i watched them make it but maybe they didnt steam the soy milk enoughwe went to baileys range to have dessert with friends we havent seen in years from different states we came on a thurs night and there was plenty of space to sit but somewhat busy we were a party of 11 with little ones the hostess was super friendly at first and said she would get us a table right away but after we told her we were looking to have ice cream for dessert it took her close to 20 minutes and talking to the manager 2x to finally seat us at the empty very long community table ice cream was average nothing special the only saving grace of this experience was our waitress alexandra who was super attentive and friendly if it wasnt for her i would give this place 1 star but because of her i would give this place another chance if im ever back in the area again has potential if the hostess and manager can get customer service concept down or be forthright and tell us plainly they dont serve large parties just for dessert so we dont waste our time next timei recently came here again after i found out about the specials  and yes they are still doing the 9951995 ld specials for this month    i went for the lunch buffet and immediately noticed a few things  the sushi selection was cut in half the hibachi and crepe stations were closed but most of the other foods were still there  although they did not taste good  the sushi rolls did not taste good either but they didnt taste bad  it was just enough to satisfy my sushi cravings as it had been a few quarters since i had it last had the soft tofu soup but it did not taste like the kind my mom makes    our server had a few questionable calls mainly when i asked for water and he came back with a refill for my brother  the rest of us needed a refill but never got one  its located about 50 mins from my house so chances are i will not return because of the distance and the fact i was not blown away by the selectionquality  also i wouldnt pay more than 1020 for a buffet meal here  but its okapparently im the only one who doesnt think the beignets at morning call are better than the ones at cafe du monde  i like someone else to regulate my powdered sugar i guess  i do however think the coffee here kicks the crap out of pretty much anything youll find in the area  heavy on the chicory  yummyi like this place its nothing too special in terms of froyo but it sure does hit the spotvery rich super sweet ice cream created with any combination of toppings crushed in with fanfare by your server i found it to be a little to rich as far as sweet and fat for my blood as my stomach agreed for the ache and nausea that occurred later if your in the are its a good place for high end ice cream there is a yogurt shop and baskin robbins in the area alsowe went there for dinner on new years eve  it was an early dinner 4pm because we walked down race street at 6pm to catch the early fireworks show  we had a mixed generation family dinner and they were very accommodating as two family members were in wheelchairs  our waitress cindy was very warm friendly and did a great job  overall everyone loved their food we had calamari appetizers which were good and stuffed mushrooms which were huge and not what we expected   entrees we ordered were grilled shrimp stuffed lobster tails and fried oysters which my dad really really liked  we also had crab balls for an app which everyone really enjoyed  old decor but classic qualify seafood in a nonfussy environment with a warm and friendly staffonly came here once and that was because i saw their sign of drink specials ended up getting a few jello shots and 1 margarita for really cheap drinks were decent sat outside at the bar probably will returnjust finding red robin when looking for a steakhouse as a frst timer the waiter told us a lot about the loyalty program  we had fish n chips and the delicious burger with beacon the fries are excellent the beef pink in the middle  i love it only the fish had too much batter around  drinks are good  all in all its worth the price  but gourmet i dont think sofood was good i had the avgolemano soup almost as good as my mothers just a bit too much rice in it and the lamb souvlaki for lunch with a side of horta  well executed food once it came out however the service was horrid i kept thinking gordon ramsey was in the back yelling oh come on because the entire full restaurant was getting no food from the kitchen  its really too bad because for standard greek fare they hit the mark  but even in greece the service is betterwe came on a saturday morning after waiting a few months after opening hoping that they would resolve the issues from a new restaurant opening we were seated right away and the server brought water coffee and took our orders right away we waited over 30 mins for breakfast i got the freebird and came out first before my husbands dish while it tastes good it was just potatoes and the spicy sausage gravy was mostly a sauce there was barely any sausage my husband got the ny deli omelette that had way too much cheese that it overpowered everything and very little pastrami lastly we were ready to go and our server spent at least 10 mins chatting at another table so i couldnt get our check im not sure if we will returnmediocre service at best pretty decent french food though   upon arriving to the restaurant you are greeted by a large sign in the middle of the walkway that says please seat yourself i typically have no issue with places that ask you to seat yourself in fact i rather enjoy picking my own seat however i wasnt greeted by an actual person for 10 minutes after finding a seat   when i was finally welcomed the person brought me water and took my order for coffee which she promptly returned with then told me someone would be along shortly to take my order   10 more minutes pass before a waiter comes to take my order keep in mind that the restaurant was only 50 full when i came in to eat   the food came out promptly after ordering as a nice change of pace and was pretty good not the best croque madame ive had but certainly not the worst either   if they improved their service i would be tempted to returnim here to echo others concern for baileys slipping quality i hope this goes beyond management to reach the attention of the ownership ill preface by conveying that we did bring most of our concerns to the attention of management and were somewhat compensated thats the only reason this isnt a 2 star review  at 200ish on saturday afternoon with about 40 table occupancy it was about 1015 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server who got our drink order just 2 soft drinks about 510 minutes later she came back and said she didnt pickup our drinks yet but could take our food order   only after we got our food and our table including kids began commenting about the portion size did my wife remind me when we were here last i said i was glad my company was paying  i realized im getting a bit long winded so  skip the gluten free bun and go breadless its poor tasting and falls apart  the pretzels are balls of sweet dough that taste like they were previously frozen and defrosted  the good news and bad news on the caesar salad croutons were that they good seemed housemade bad were badly overtoasted  i thought the 5 fries we received were the 3 fries based on the quantity and the table consensus was they could have been a bit crispierfresher  the manager only took off the 1 gluten free bun upgrade and the pretzels he was apologetic and blamed it on being understaffed   it didnt seem to be a staffing issue but that everyone from host team to servers were just a bit too laid back about their jobs to help their guests the way a 20 per guest restaurant should beoh how i want to like baileys range more  the good they have a community table dinner once a month where they have guest chefs come in and create a buffet different each month  it costs 20 all you care to eat and all proceeds go to a different organization each month  beautiful concept and beautifully executed  they make their own gluten free bread  they have the brilliant combo of bourbon candied bacon and salted caramel ice cream  mmmmmgood  the not so good the gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired  very dense heavy and super crumbly  i admire the desire to make things in house but there are way better gluten free bread makers in st louis that could provide them with buns  the burger abc burger was dry and way too overcooked for my taste    the price is waaaay too high in my opinion and i left there feeling nickel and dimed for every little thing   overall i will be back to try again  third times the charm rightso my fav thing about cracker barrel is the store the restaurant is spacey inside and our server was really nice but the food was typical chain style southern food i wasnt blown away in fact i didnt eat most of it i got the chicken fried chicken and it was overcooked the breading was hard on my teeth and im only 30 lol but it wasnt great the mac and cheese was bland too but the cucumber tomato salad was good my fiance loved his food though but hes from new jersey im from the south so i know southern food i kept hearing all this hype about cracker barrel and how great it is so i was really excited to try it and i was really disappointed its just not great food by any means and for anyone else who knows southern food you will probably be disappointed too unless you like mediocre stuff the shop however is a gem they have so much stuff i felt like a kid the staff was really friendly there toodidnt love it didnt hate it  the ingredients get lost in the pizza and it almost seems bland because the flavors dont stand out  the price and delivery time are on par though so if youre hungry lazy and broke call emyou know its okay its a nice enough place with decent enough coffee i went more than once during my trip  if this is the best new orleans has to offer however i am afraid to see what the other places look like inventive vegan and gluten free options on the shelf with the baked goods that said  no need to cross the street for the vegan empanada  lots of black beans and not worth the risk  crowd is ok lots of folks homesteading on their laptops as you might expectbeautiful supermarket but beauty isnt free everything is more expensive here  they do have a great hot food bar their deli has a great system for slicing meats exactly how you want them when you order and how they pack them is perfect  their jewish food area is great good whitefish salad and rjs bagels  if you need a hard to find item its probably here but again loosen your purse stringshuge menu  something for everyone  good lunch specialsdrink and soup included  been staying with the corned beef sandwich latelyvery goodvery fresh rye bread  food is fine very large lunch crowd  avoid ruby the waitress she hates her job and it shows in her negative attitude and lack of efficient service shes goin thru the motions and hating every minutes of it if you dont ask for itemsyou dont get thempicklespepsicorrect orderthis isnt chinatown but for your local chinese food fix china wok is just fine fast delivery and courteous service the food is better than average at a good price they dont do fancy food for that theres other places in the area but if your a pork fried rice egg roll spare rib etc type of person this place is fine 5 stars for the fast deliveryrecently visited for a family birthday dinner i chose the restaurant from my past experience i have to say i was disappointed with my entree  on this visit  i had the grilled mahi mahi usually my fave fish the mahi had no flavor was very bland and a sort of fishy taste the side of capellini pasta was equally disappointing the marinara sauce tasted like pure tomato sauce out of the can   the other entrees at the table were veal montalbano and chicken pontchartrain the guests liked their entrees so maybe i chose the wrong dish but i dont think i will be back for awhilethe smoothies and bowls there are good i have already been back it was just that i wanted a larger smoothie size its just a suggestion to management i dont get smoothies from any places that add sugar or artificial ingredients so understand that i did enjoy karma but just wanted a larger drink we were walking around downtown and it would have been nice to have itfirst remember this is a tourist area  we were visiting family and wanted to take them out for dinner at a greek restaurant this was a different one than we had went prior when visiting in tarpon springs  the place is what americans think greek is  alot of white and blue  we were seated against the window facing the street so i like our location of seating  out of the traffic area  ordered dolmades and a greek salad for all to share both were good  the gyro one had was a bit dry fried grouper sandwich was good the lamb shank wspagetti was different however the lamb didnt fall off the bone could be the method of cooking compared to other shanks that i have had and the stuffed grouper with crab was good  cant say compared to other greek restaurants that it would be my pick to drive out of the way for however it was ok  found some of the desserts that were picked up for later way over the top with sugar  havent had anything this sweet at anyother greek restaurants  bakery i have been toonice creamy product with unusual flavors but the prices are pretty high if you are planning on taking the family two of us got two scoops in a cup and it cost us almost 20i think the biggest takeaway at koffee korner is the value  huge portions and low prices  my buddy and i stopped in for a late breakfast yesterday and had a real nice visit  we both ordered omelets which were huge  each came with a generous portion of hashbrowns and toast  throw in coffee and our bill total was only 15  food was good served piping hot and service was friendly  i had the western omelet and my buddy had the farmers  we came in 30 minutes before closing but they did not rush us out at all  plenty of street parking nearby  typical diner atmosphere with counter seating tables and booths  seems like they can fit in a decent crowd on a busy weekend morning  not exactly around the korner from me but worth another visit if we are in lansdale againthis review is based off of one visit as i dont think i will be returning anytime soon   i was attending a christmas get together at besito with a large group of about 16 i ordered a frozen margarita it was the only frozen margarita on the menu and was pomegranate it was okay but a little off for my tastes it was also melted and no longer frozen within a few minutes of it arriving i only finished about half of it we ordered during happy hour when the margarita is supposed to be 5 instead of the usual 9 we had to ask for the happy hour price but more on that in a moment   three of us decided to split a queso fundito this is one of my favorite mexican appetizers and i order it regularly at traditional mexican restaurants while the queso fundito was still good at besito it was disappointing to someone that has had a traditional version it is supposed to be essentially a fondue type pot of melted cheese with some chorizo and served with tortillas besito cheapened theirs by adding piles of onions and peppers it was also served in a very shallow square skillet when split three ways and with the 23 others in the room that tried it it left very little queso fundito the flavor was good however with the added thick peppers and onions and the small quantity i would not order again   i was able to try the chips salsa and table side guacamole also i will say that this is probably the best guacamole that i have ever tried i loved the flavor and the thick chunks of avocado the salsa and guac were my favorite things at besito however i cant see myself paying 10 for guac on a return visit that is just way too much for guacamole in my opinion   for my meal i ordered the chile rellenos con hongos i order rellenos anytime i see them on the menu since they are one of my favorite things most restaurants serve them with some rice and beans or some sort of side lets face itstuffed relleno peppers are not the most filling thing in the world my rellenos did not come with a side the came with sauce and nothing else for a whopping 18 i almost didnt order them when i saw the price but everything else on the menu was that price or higher the rellenos had good flavor for the first biteor maybe two however a few bites in i was over it they are stuffed in goat cheese and there are globs of goat cheese on the outside so much freaking goat cheese i like the stuff but it was overboard that wasnt the worst part though it was the pine nuts there seemed to be a whole bag of the things mixed into my small plate i would never order this again   our service was great until it came time for the checks our waitress did not give us happy hour prices for the margaritas we ordered before happy hour was up she also messed up dividing our appetizer between the three checks however the worst was that we handed the checks to them with our cards in each individual envelope when they returned my card was with my friends check and had been charged and my check was missing wth it ended up taking us about 45 minutes to get our checks get them corrected get them corrected again and get out of there my poor husband had dropped me off and was waiting outside this whole time since i thought i was almost done when i received the check uggg   i dont think i will be back to besito anytime soon if i do it will be for happy hour only it is too rich and not on par enough for this cheap but picky girllove that they have military discount  thank you  variety of burgers  shake was good love they have coke products house ketchup was great you can have a lettuce wrapped sandwich   issues sweet potato fries not cooked well enough  truffle fries okay  burger under cooked and asked for well done on the expensive side for what you get  it will be a one time visitsi am still giving it 3 stars despite my most recent experience in general i love this place i like to bring people from out of town because they get good food and get to try beer they wouldnt otherwise parking is tricky though  dont come on a sunday night though i think its just because no one was around but the cheese in the cheeseburger was frozen solid not pleasant otherwise the beer was good and so was the food  pros good beer good food interesting place to see cons parking can be annoying sunday night servicefood is the opposite of busier timeslocated in the suburbs morning call serves beignets just like its rival cafe du monde its more of a lower key place definitely less touristy you will find more local patrons rather than tourists dwelling here it is also opened 247 i was told it has been opened almost as long as cafe du monde and that its original location use to be down the street from them its a nice change of pace from the rush you get from the french quarters  the beignets here contain a bit more dough and are definitely thicker they dont automatically dump the powdered sugar for you they have it on each table and you do it yourself  the prices here are about the same as their competitors its more of a chilled out spot the people here are leisurely browsing their laptops newspaper and just conversing in their own world  if you want to avoid the mayhem at the other beignet spot then come here or if youre in the area its much more relaxed but youll notice a difference in taste and texture which also includes the cafe au laiti dont know why i had such high expectations of this farmers market but i did  i guess i thought it would be similar to those i find at the beach cities of san diego  i was a little shocked at how small it was  it is one of the bigger farmers markets that i have been to but i guess i still had those expectations  the location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing  however i wasnt a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market  in terms of the vendors they have the typical fruits and veggies eggs meat flowers etc  i was a fan of this pie that i was given a sample of on my way out of the marketso after coming here several times and after the thrill of the newness is over i can review this honestly   this place is overrated their food is overpriced compared to other healthy food places even with the sales it is sometimes not even worth it the produce also gets old quickly and i can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less i do browse the sale options and i come sometimes for that after i compare them to other stores   the salad bar prepared meals are meh actually disappointing i always end up driving to whole foods  every time i try to do my grocery shopping here i always end up having to go to other stores to find what i need for the week i cant say that i have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like i got the best deal   the only time i come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors i dont hate it but its just not the first place i would come to or think to do my full grocery shopping the staff is really nice though  i wanted to like this place more but it just isnt doing it for mecame here to grab a couple of beers on a thursday night  it was surprisingly busy given that the place just opened  supposedly this is a side project from the folks at farmers cabinet and you can tell based on the lighting or lack thereof  thank god the hostess led us up the stairs because i couldnt see a damn thing  but enough of my whininglets get back to the important stuff    there are 24 taps downstairs and then they keep the 12 local taps at the upstairs bar  i was pleased with the engine 1892 market stout from philadelphia brewing company which was a recommendation from the bartender rocco  he clearly knew his beers but was also able to recommendsuccessfully make some cocktails for my friends  he was also very personable  the food menu looked really good but it was under the coming soon section so i was unsure if it was actually available last night  i was intrigued by the turnip kimchi that apparently comes on their hot dogs  ill definitely be back to try that and will update my yelp review accordingly    to summarize a great place for beer aficionados  and vampires  im torn between giving 3 and 4 stars but i figure i can always go up once i try their foodif you are looking for the classic small cramp sushi place then this is the place for you the service is lack luster but the food makes up for the poor table management and not so smart waitersnot sure how to review this place fairly the effort on the part of the owners is top notchlove how the order process follows you to the table so any follow up dishes you might want dont require waiting in the front line again however the culinary execution failed somehow or at least it fell strangely flat while all the food we had beef souvlaki lamb pita and grilled octopus was decent it definitely wasnt transcendent it was just food also the ubiquitous french fries were only semiaddictive as were a  little dry   while this is maybe the best greek food in nashville that in itself doesnt warrant 5 stars what we concluded after eating all the food was while greko was okay there was nothing that we had that would draw us backate dinner at pinocchios  it was ok  service was good and they refunded us the price of the shrimp because we thought the shrimp tasted a little too fishy  i had the lite plate  it was ok  nothing to write home about  he had the fresh raviolis which i thought was better than my dinner  we ordered the kids pasta with white sauce and that seemed pretty good he ate it all   the drinks were ok  we had a coronarita call it a turborita  and a top shelf bloody mary prices are middle of the road  about 10 to 15 bucks for adult dinner  desert was awesome we shared a big slice of mud pie  ate half of the desert and took the other half homecold day some weeks agohad heard great recommendations and went there to enjoy the food and scenery  very pretty spot  the order was pasta with clans and lobster tacos  both tasted good but nothing special by he seating out door was a mess but we were hungry  an ok placei came here for my birthday dinner and the waitress was very forgetful and basically sucked we brought a bottle of tequila for margaritas and i am almost certain the waitress stole a nice amount of it the bottle was returned with 16th left and we only had two pitchers and the two waitresses were acting drunk when we left good food poor serviceas a big fan of baileys chocolate bar their tiramisu martini is my favorite drink ever i really really wanted to love this place too but i just didnt  i had a cheeseburger fries with their cheese sauce and a peanut butter milkshake  the burger was okay and i probably wouldve liked it better had i not put their homemade ketchup on it before tasting it  im not sure what is up with their ketchup but i just didnt really care for it  too sweet perhaps  it just didnt taste quite right to me the fries were good as was their cheese sauce  and the peanut butter shake was amazing  i did try some of my husbands food and i guess thats partially why i only am giving baileys range 3 stars he ordered honey mustard sauce with his fries and there was nothing honey flavored about it it just tasted like spicy mustard to me which neither of us particularly care for  i wont even get started on the bacon milkshake he ordered and didnt care for because thats his own fault for ordering something so strange  in short i wasnt all that impressed  if i ever go again maybe ill stick with the dessert and skip the food  either that or bring my own condimentstucked on 76 ave is a small cozy cafe usually filled with local students because there arent too many parking spots the prices at this cafe are a bit higher than that of remedy and the seating arrangements are tight there are large comfy seats and more table seating it is convenient and quite accessible to the neighborhood although higher prices will incur ambient noise would be higher due to the smaller space  mosaic cafe is very similar however space and table seating are also an issuethis is a decent mediterranean place  the food was nothing special honestly your run of the mill mediterranean food   the area is kind of spotty and we almost drove past the place the first time but the inside is nice enoughthe tea is not that goodbut the cheese cream is great matcha is fine toowe took my father here for his 80th birthday  we made a reservation for a party of 10 but they did not seem to have the reservation  so there was no table ready for us  it was early so there was no issue with getting a table we just had to wait for it to be assembled  other than that we enjoyed the experience  the waitress was attentive and there was not a long wait for anything  also she did not add an automatic gratuity to the bill even though we were a large party  there were no complaints about any of the foodcue up im bad by ll cool j put on your kangol and replace lyrics with  calling all cars calling all cars  be on the lookout for a lanky white boy with curry stains on his shirt  wearing a

taking a shot dropping reviews like your butt on the pot youre a novice i am noble never biting my tongue the mad hungarian just declare that ive won  my reviews are exact like a rack and pinion on a jag when you order food from zaikka its like a grabbag they dont serve scavengers like catfish vulture  consider this review permanent like a yelp battlerap sculpture  im bad  btw this review was written under the influence of the flu in a fever induced haze   i am outi will start by saying i love the layout of this place they also have a good variety of drinks and food depending on what you are looking for  however every time ive been here the service has left a lot to be desired and caused me to leave earlier than i would have    i had a flight of wine and was planning on getting some food and another drink but after the initial delivery of my flight no one checked in with me for the next 45 minutes   i had even mentioned i was thinking about food  this is the second time ive had this sort of experience here  hopefully it improvesi hit the drivethru at this white castle last night with my aunt on our way home from carmel i was starving and it hit the spot   our order was taken right away and in a friendly manner the food seemed to take several minutes but was hot and fresh and worth the wait it was my first time trying the new veggie sliders they arent the best veggie burgers i have ever had and are quite high in calories from what i hear but were good i appreciate that white castle started offering these for the cravers that no longer do meat  the only small disappointment was that when we were asked if we wanted sauce what kind of sauce i do not know i requested mustard on my sliders and that was left off there also were no napkins or salt in the bag it was hard to tell my veggie slider from my aunts fish sandwich digging in the bag in the car the large portions on our medium fries made up for it though as well as being a quick and convenient place for someone like me to grab a meal on the run that contained some much needed protein  service was friendly and the restaurant seemed clean it appears to be either a newer store or a very wellkept one bonus was seeing one of the indy chicken limos down the road  updating to say while good tasting the food i had did not sit quite right with me  it was possibly that im not used to greasy combined with being out of sorts lately tastes good but i may need antacid or something next timethe right place for the best authentictasting ny bagels the wrong place if youre looking for a smilethis was a fun place with friendly and fun bartenders  the food was pretty good toothis is my usual but only because my neighborhood has no grocery store even though its been 5 12 years since katrina   anyway the parking lot is a freaking death trap people park in the fire lanes and clog up the aisles with their poor parking a lot of this probably has to do with the fact that this place is the only grocery store for a lot of people the produce is unreliable except they have a board by the front door that lists the local produce which i love and use to buy as locally as possible all other rouses dont have this but they should a few of the gentlemen that work in produce are helpful in answering questions about when items will return or where they are etc   the bakery grinds out new fresh bread every day and most of it is really tasty warning though they dont list the nutritional information on the packages so you might get something you dont want in your tummy  theyve recently added a natural section which has organic and all natural foodbeauty products this makes me very happy but i usually buy the rouses brand organic canned goods because they are cheaper    as i mentioned earlier this place serves as the sole provider of groceries to a lot of people what that means to you is that on busy times at like 6 pm or right before saints games it is so busy that you cant go in an aisle without smashing into someone and it gets really frustrating i try to go on off times and pray for the day when they reopen the store on elysian fieldsdecent food decent amounts just order a few different plates and share with the others at the tableahh my not so secret  love affair with cupcakes deepens with my experience at jimmies cupcake truck stopping at one i would love to see you try my darling   the day i came upon this truck i was all about some cupcakes and they had a pretty amazing variety i was torn but not for long i started at their james bond red velvet cupcake and was immersed in a moist and creamy cupcake heaven just the right amount of sweetness for the frosting and the cupcakes were not too dense and not too light it was perfection i took out the cookies and cream cupcake next the little oreo cookies in the cupcake battergenius the frosting tasted just like oreo filling and i was taken back to my childhood i finished off with a menue special  apple cake cupcake it was buttery cinnomony what and all the things that taste like fall hallelujah   my only regret that day was that i could not eat any morethe filet mignon is good always cooked well when i order it the banana foster is also very yummy they cook it table side overall not a bad placei had a large party reservation 10 people for 830 on a friday night i made the reservation a week in advance and was told it was no problem we didnt get seated until 915 the hostess kept telling us that they were waiting to get tables together im not sure what she meant by that but it was annoying to have 10 people standing around waiting for a table for 45 minutes   we waited at the bar and had some margaritas the first one we tried the natural one tasted watered down the bartender then informed us it had water in it who puts water in a margarita we tried the classic next it was better but not great the ingredients listed next to the margaritas on the menu are not accurate so be sure to ask the bartender exactly whats in each one   once we were seated our waiter was extremely nice and did a great job with such a large party we had 3 orders of the table side guacamole and they were delicious for dinner most of us orders appetizer portions because we had filled up on the guac and all the free chips and salsa my tacos were okay they came on corn tortillas and i should have asked for flour ones but the carne asada was delicious i asked for no cilantro but it was on there i didnt want to send it back because it was already 1030 and i was just so hungry at that point  not sure ill be back there are a lot better mexican places in tampa but you have to try everything at least oncefood tastes ok howevergiven the price they give you stingy amount of meat  despite the ownerwaitress friendly service i still left feeling ripped offfood good but music so loud its hard to hear youre friends talking also its a bit of mayhem when you have to wait in line to order and pay cuban sandwich is delishlove the food been bringing the fam here for years recently the service has gotten very slow compared to years past  some of the servers have a sulky attitudesad good news is their other location is just do n the roada great little caf the salads and sandwiches are very good i suggest trying the city hall a jalapeo pimento cheese and bacon panini very friendly and helpful staff great placetasty food slightly marked up with prices but thats to be expected since it is on stearns wharf long waita decent coffeehouse with lots of seats  tables for working but theres no wifi which makes it kind of a useless cafe if you want to do work both of the green teas sold here were very refreshing thoughvery tasty filling meals  oversized desserts which is good  very attentive staff  lousy coffee thoughwent with a large group and the service was decent i ordered the swedish pancakes but the waitress gave me the wrong one i didnt realize it until another person who ordered swedish pancakes got theirs which looks way different than mine  they mistakenly gave me blueberry pancakes  it was too late to argue because i was already half way done eating it  i was hungry  overall the food tasted average  not really worth waiting in line  i would recommend other diners if u dont want to wait in lineso i definitely much prefer the feel of the tasting room in kessler but if you want the full upland menu you have to come here everything was good i had the seitan tenderloin which i always have liked and this was no different and an ard ri to drink also delicious as always   the bar seating is really tight but there are plenty of tables and a surprising amount of families also a general comment i went with someone who is full on gluten free celiac figuring with their amount of veg friendly they would also be gf friendly but she struggled to find something to eat and items were not identified on the menu this is not specific to this location but some options may be a good idea for these folksi stopped here because it was on the way back from my dads house its not one of my usual places but i figured why not  i generally stop here maybe a few times a year usually after visits to my dad i realized why that is the case there are better snowballs in new orleans  thats not to say this place is horrible ive had better and ive had worse that earns three stars from me  i got the jumbo size as i always do they didnt quite put enough syrup in it i saw a chunk of white ice where they missed a spot i prefer a lot of syrup  the other thing that turned me off was their setup they have bars on their windows and they keep them shut except for when taking your order and giving you your snowball the window that they hand you your snowball is completely covered with newspaper articles so you cant watch your snowball made then theres a sign saying please dont knock on the window so its like you cant check on your order if its taking too long  maybe theyve been robbed there before or something but when im there i feel like im in a bank in a high crime areathe food was great good enough that i will return but the service was well interesting our server was too friendly coming over often just to start conversation with us and even sitting down with us towards the end of the meal to talk to us i appreciate friendly service but this was a little too much i however got the bison burger and it was wonderful and the beer was great tooi was surprisingly not pleased about maynards after reading all the decent reviews i expected a lot more i dont live in tucson but my girlfriend does and i only get to see her about 2 nights every couple months so its a special occasion when i do make it up to tucson wanting to take her somewhere nice we booked maynards   arriving we had a hard time trying to find parking which wasnt the restaurants fault as downtown tucson is undergoing some major improvements once we got inside the hostess was nice we sat down and it took awhile for our waiter to make his way to us   we both were really excited and hungry for a good meal the bread was extremely slow coming out and was rock hard the service was not the best our waiter was slow and didnt seem very busy even though it was friday night   i ordered the burger and my girlfriend had the filet mignon the food made it out decently timed but i was unhappy when i took a bite into my burger i ordered it medium and it was burnt to the crisp way past over done and had no color just burnt black for a 20 dollar burger it was not what i expected had no flavor whatsoever but the bacon i bought for an extra 200 on the burger was really good so thats a positive   now for the positives the bacon was really good the size of the burger was perfect and the french fries on the side were amazing   my girlfriend loved her steak and i took a bite and it was really good so i was happy with her meal and she loved my fries as well  overall it wasnt that bad of an experience and i would dine there again my rating is so low due to the burger not being cooked very good might of been the waiters fault or the chief just wasnt feeling on his burger game that night if we were to go again and i am sure we will i would definitely not be getting the burger and focus on there steak which was really goodi echo the same sentiment that if you havent really had any type of gourmet donut you will love these i think the flavors are interesting and creative but the actual dough is bland and made without sugar if you get the donuts get the extra fancy which are cream filled and usually tastier i will say that their sandwiches and burgers are really good flavored just right good ingredientsbe sure to ask for a written receipt and check it closely  i didnt get gone one and am pretty sure i was overcharged during happy houri came here for my birthday as mentioned by aria s i made reservations for a wed night for a group of 9 this is their max good thing too because every table was full since this is a byob we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table as i looked around every other table had ice for their wine i had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table he took our wine and put it over on a window sill this was a little strange but it only got worse we didnt know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us we spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine not exactly how i wanted to spend my bday dinner its especially frustrating because this is a byob restaurant youd think this wouldnt have been an issue besides this the service was fine they also accommodate to the gluten free people out there  onto the food we started with dips of the day very authentic and tasty i ordered the braised rabbit leg i thought the meat itself was fine i wish it was seasoned better and more tender especially for 26 luckily i was able to try a few of my friends dishes my favorite was the stuffed pepper i really wish i ordered that instead   unfortunately i will not be coming back here i wish i was able to have a great experience like some of the people belowi had a great salad here  wipe visions of wimpy unsatisfying fare from your mind  it was a loaded bowl with nothing but healthy toppings  really no atmosphere to speak of  get in eat get out  unfortunately the dude that helped me was unpolite  he rolled his eyes the whole time then informed me the salad i was choosing was too much food and made fun of the fact i couldnt pronounce anything correctly  every time i picked a topping he questioned me about it  what a jerkthe food is okay the rice under the sushi seems hard sometimes the hot pots are pretty good though the shabu shabu is what i come for overall its good but not greatso after a 30 minute plus wait for saturday brunch i was excited just to sit down they had water at the table and two glasses filled luke warm tap water so lets just say i couldnt be happier to get my mimosa which was pretty tasty that waiter jonathan was great very attentive and friendly i ordered a monte cristo french toast honey roasted ham mascarpone and pineapple i couldnt wait to dig in my boyfriend ordered salmon beni and it looked fabulous just as i took a bite of my sandwich which was great  my boyfriends facial expression changed as he pulled a long piece of blond hair from his food needless to say we were done however they did comp our meal and gave us a few free doughssants  they were very apologetic about the incident  i think ill probably go back again but not sure i could convince my man tohad dinner with three family members lovely evening on the deck  service was fine as always  unfortunately the veal parm i ordered wasnt  it was dry and tasteless to be fair my table mates enjoyed their dinners  drinks were good as was our dessert a profiterole   but i cant help the thought that something as straightforward and usual as veal parm should be great every time at a good restaurant specializing in italian foodwe were in from out of town and went here due to the reviews and awesome looking pastries we waited about an hour to be seated there were times when quite a few tables were open at a time now ive been a waitress before and am aware that you dont want to be double or triple seated but if it was that bad maybe more staffwaiters would have helped our waitress on the other hand was nice but seemed to be very overwhelmed we were asked three times of we wanted anything to drink we ordered the poutine fries and the egg breakfast as well as one of the doughnutcroissant in the peanut butter churro flavor the poutine fries were really good my husband enjoyed them the egg breakfast was good too bacon was crispy and thick my favorite my eggs came out over easy when i asked for over hard oh well the pastry was good not the best we did wait a while for the food and for the check so the waitress was nice enough to bring a pastry for free we took it to go and it was good but i will say the next time we visit tucson we probably wont be stopping bywent there for first time and had a buffet which for price is not bad considering the quantity of items served but quality wise its not good at all in my opinion i tried everything but really didnt like anything and specially i was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible im giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely the restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve good lucktasty  we ordered 5 different dishes and 3 different apps  scallion pancakes were delicious  the garlic beef was very good  my oldest who likes fish ordered fish in pickled chili  it was good but fried fish in a soggy sauce was mediocre  food came out fast but service was very good  home style tofu was very good but clashed with other dishes3 stars for food 4 stars for service  when we walked in we were greeted by friendly welcoming staff  they gave us menus and answered any questions  we ordered and sat outside  the inside has only has a few tables and there are a few wooden picnic tables outside  very relaxed atmosphere  they have tacos and bowls they have small selection of beer only bottles and cansno drafts i had the sangria and it was very average the food came out super fast  i had a bowl that had shrimp rice beans guacamole salsa and queso fresco  nothing to write home about  it came with a side of tortillas and those were delicious actually the best part of the meal  the bowl reminded me exactly of chipotle but i think chipotle might actually be a little stronger  my husband had tacos  again nothing special  i do feel the tacos were a bit over priced 350 for what you were getting  taco bus tacos cost the same but the taste is head and shoulders above  the food was fresh but it was just missing something would not return with the amount of other authentic mexican options in the areathis review is only for the donuts and coffee i selected the almond joy donut and iced vanilla latte we came here based on all the reviews on yelp and it could have been a miss due to the donut offerings of that day 8 varieties 4 specialties such as neapolitan late night snack etc and 4 somewhat normal selections such as glaze cinnamon roll etc i was looking for the vietnamese coffee flavor or blueberry flavored donut but they didnt have either   the almond joy donut was a disappointment it tasted like any other donut ive tasted before i was looking for more of a coconut and almond taste the iced vanilla latte was okay as wellnatural cafe is one of the best restaurants for vegetarians  their buddha burritos and falafel pitas are among my favorites their new location at camino real marketplace is great too  although the older one at old town was more classic    the reason i gave 3 stars instead of a 45 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have  first  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts  i find this very silly  the name of the restaurant is natural cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment  but its strange that they need a paper printout and dont allow if we show them the email in the phone   second  they are also very strict with timings  if you come around the closing time 9 pm they just keep showing at the table to get you out  the older place at old town was more relaxed with the timings   i would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules  the food here is still one of the besti was all too underwhelmed by pre and pastry my amazing fiance and i went there for breakfast one day with high expectations i love a good breakfast and am a picky eater i understand that not everywhere has something i love but i remained hopeful the inside is darling and has a promising ambiance we were sat at a tiny table that was incredible unstable once we had our waters and coffee the table was nearly full and very shakey our server was an awkward girl who wouldnt look us in the eyes  i ordered the sweet potato hash with no eggs and my fiance had duck fat gravy with biscuits my meal had little to no flavor and i ended up using tobasco to make it resemble tasting like something my fiance said his meal had no flavor and was greasey  maybe if we ordered differently we could really like the place but we are turned off by it now if you go do not get the sweet potato hashpopped in for allday breakfast recently  realized its a very limited breakfast menu wish it was the full menu all day the manager was very helpful  attentive the other employees werent great the main dining area was clean  tidy but the side area was messy  not very clean my food came out hot  fresh though so im happy about thatim giving bottleworks three stars based upon the diningfood experience  particularly what you get for the money you have to spend there my rating is not based upon their barbeer and general environment as a whole  i like schlafly bottleworks as a barpatio spot and i appreciate schlaflys approach in general they host some great events have a really nice space good beer and have friendly service but that said the food has not been great for me here  in my past two visits ive tried something pricey and then something cheap hohum on both first  the pricey dish which was the pretzel encrusted chicken schlafly is not the least bit shy charging 1519 for their entrees and this one is 18 the chicken was a decent portion i suppose but it was a tad dry overall flavor just ok the mashed potatoes which come with it were good but for 18 i better be full and happy plain and simple  then last night i was really hungry and went for the bottleworks burger this was definitely a disappointment i ordered it medium it came out pretty much welldone that i could tolerate if it were either a juicy or b flavorful i got neither here the potato wedges were awesome however  now i saw someone order the bison meatball spaghetti and that looked huge and appetizing   i do love the bar and patio here and they often get in some good live music but unfortunately the food prices for what you get are just a bit suspect to metime out new york named this one of the top 20 italian restaurants in the us it was the only restaurant on their list not located in a major food city nyc chicago etc and as it happened its a 5minute drive from my home i figured i had to try it  the restaurant itself is the size of a postage stamp with maybe 10 tables youre not getting in without reservations so if youre interested in eating here make sure you call ahead  would i call this one of the best italian restaurants in the country frankly no that doesnt mean its not good but dining out is about more than just the food and this is the area i feel is lacking im not talking about the servers who were friendly and knowledgeable due to the size restrictions and the fact that the restaurant is almost completely woodfurnished the noise level is insane i know they are going for that sicilian trattoria feel but some noisecancelling measures like curtains or plants could have been helpful it was almost impossible to carry a conversation with my dining companions without screaming   the food the menu is set up for a traditional italian threecourse meal of salad pasta and entree my friend and i started with the antipasto for two and the panzanella bread salad the bread salad  topped with capers white anchovies and wonderful if outofseason tomatoes  was a winner the antipasto was a mixed bag some items the charred broccoli housecured beets and tuna with white beans were amazing others the carrots cauliflower potatoes and cheeses were surprisingly bland  for my pasta course i had the housemade tagliatelli with lemon sauce topped with bottarga tuna roe the pasta was well made perfect consistency the sauce was decent it had a nice spice but the lemon was a little overwhelming  and i say that as someone who loves citrus i am not sure that the saltiness of the bottarga was the perfect complement to this dish either  i had the rabbit for my entree it was excellent falloffthebone tender and served in a great sauce i was a bit disappointed though that it was served with just a few unremarkable potatoes as the garnish the server had mentioned that the dishes were proteinheavy but even so i wanted something a little more exciting on the side my friend is vegetarian and thus opted for pasta as her main course she sampled the spinach and ricotta gnocchi which were quite nice  desserts were a homemade ice cream sandwich of sorts with pistachio gelato excellent and a lemon tart good but not mindblowinggood food and for a chain very good food it lived up to its reputation of serving fresh food i give it three stars instead of four mainly because its probably not on my top 10 places in reno for mexican food chipotle is not even my favorite mexicanthemed chain restaurant that would be el pollo loco for my meal i got a burrito with beef black beans white rice sour cream cheese lettuce and maybe some other stuff i added a patrone margarita and a bag of chips with what they described as their hottest sauce i had to wait about a month to try the place because the lines were so long the previous times i came the staff was friendly when i placed my order i got my burrito chips and salsa when i paid and the maragarita came a few minutes later chipotle failed to live up to the hype with my first bite of food the chips are good quality chips the salsa tastes mass produced it was supposed to be their hottest salsa but it had a streak of that sweet ketchup flavor some shows up in salsas some times my favorite salsas are the red salsa from the michoacan region of mexico with its nice garlic kick  the ingredients in the burrito were fresh but there were two significant flaws no 1 is that the rice overwhelmed everything else usually if one ingredient overwhelms a burrito it seems it is the beans but not in this case it made the burrito bland and a little dry the second flaw was all the gristle i found on the beef my tray had more than a half dozen chunks of inedible meat on it by the time i finished i decided to spare yelpers a photo of that the margarita was okay id get one again but it was routine theres basically two kinds of wine bars those that serve wine that wine geeks like these are the ones that have the hardest time surviving and those that are a place where women feel safe to drink i get the sense that chipotle is a mexican restaurant designed to make gringos feel safe to eat there  again for a chain they serve good quality food i can get better food for less money at a half dozen taquerias around town  chipotle is a smoke jalapeno used in cooking for people who have never had a good chipotle in a mexican restaurant i would suggest trying the camarones ala diabla devil shrimp at la fuente in sparks its quite a bit spicier than the hot salsa served at chipotle but it has great depth of flavorgreat location at the end of the wharf get a table outside on the side where you can drink alcohol be prepared to wait for a long time for these spots interesting to watch them prepare and cook the crabs shared an assortment of food calamari and rock crab were delicious lobster bisque was not very flavorful too creamy not enough lobster and bread bowl was very dryonly a three star review because we were only able to try the crab cakes and the clam chowder so its not fair to give this place too high or too low of a mark  quickly crab cakes  tender and crumbly they dont taste like crab which is what i prefer the crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings i loved those  clam chowder  pretty standard it didnt blow your mind but it also wasnt too fishy which can happen with clam chowder  we saw everyone ordering crab and lobster and we just salivated at the thought  we had dinner plans later that day so we couldnt try any of the big shellfish items they definitely looked delicious  some notes  the indoor seating is limited its a small shack at the end of the pier it was cold and windy the day we were there yeah can you believe it so there was more of a wait to sit inside  not good for big groups indoors parking is free with validationthe parking lot and the people surrounding it is a little scary  the store is limited in my opinion definitely has its pros and cons i found out there is an app u can download to load digital coupons by that seems like its all the perks they have  i was impressed that my nagger asked if i would like to have him load my bags in my car havent had someone ask me that in a grocery store ever  they have the best fried chicken but when i got home i didnt think mine was very fresh like im  used to granted it was almost closing time they should have had it discounted in my opinionwe stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered a classic and the depot burger we asked specifically that they be rare the classic came in closer to medium and depot burger had no pink at all why is it so hard to make a rare burger any way the food was good the grilled onions were awesome our waitress was great and the over cook burger was removed from our bill with an apology talk about being a stand up place we will go again and most likely recommendthe day before i leave for las vegas for my bachelor party boo suggests we spend a healthy and romantic evening together by eating at agno for dinner then walking down to lite choice considering the next meal i would have would be a heineken courtesy of southwest airlines at 730 in the morning i figured maybe it would be a good idea to keep in healthy   walking in i almost felt like et when the government comes in and throws him on a table in the blue tent it was so bright in there i felt like all my blemishes and insecurities would be exposed its a very big store much larger than other froyo places in the city and is well equipped to feed the masses in the dead of summer   when i walked to the counter the girl working there was very friendly and gave me a few suggestions which i didnt take and i actually went for the tres leche which is coconut and dulce de leche mixed i got a medium with carob chips on top and it came out over 6 i expected to pay a lot  just because that seems to be the theme of phila yogurt shops what was interesting is that they whipped the yogurt once it was in the cup to make it seem bigger i thought this was kinda weird id rather have some dense yogurt than something light and airy but whatev  the flavor was really good not mind blowing but really good what i really liked most about is that its all organic and they dont use high fructose corn syrup that is extremely important to me most places dont use hormone treated diary so that was almost expected but the corn syrup was a nice touch  i cant say this would be my first choice but i can definitely see myself going back heredirty bathrooms and very slow service but i was pleased because they had a tv on with subtitles and the volume on and it was turned to the news  a good place to pass some time with a tasty mcsnack and a hot coffee while in philly during a chilly day  we stopped here on the way to a football game and found it a very pleasant and relaxing place to hang out for a whilei go to this casino very often and for long time now im very upset i need to pay 10 every time i go there for parking it used to be free and it should be free for a place like that that profits really nicely it should definitely be complementary i understand that now they have construction expenses but that will also bring more people and the casino will keep profiting even more than before if not a complimentary parking for all at least for locals besides that i would want to see healthier food options organic at least for how pricy they are but vegan options would be much better for everyone and not only food that makes heart disease and cancer besides that the casino is clean professional and lots of funwe were looking forward to dining here and made reservations only to wait over an hour  we were disappointed  the waitress wasnt very helpful with helping us order from the menu which is in french  she seemed arrogant  owners seem like awesome people  we loved and miss the bleubird cafeoverpriced mediocre at best try bjs around the corner its a bit more  but worth it food is better too this place is like tgif and on its way outpassably good dim sum i was in love with the chinese broccoli in oyster sauce the sesame and red bean balls and the shrimp stuffed eggplant most of the rest was good too we also ended up with an odd gelatinous beef that wasnt to my taste at all but i am sure it was a mistake of ordering to my liking rather than sub par cooking by the restaurant i would return but i think i would go for their soup with roast duck and dumplings over dim sum next time their duck and pork and bakery case items always look so tasty when i am hereyum i love everything about these burgersexcept the price they arent horribly expensive but they are expensive enough for me to only go if i absolutely cannot settle for anything else for lunch i also hate how they charge 05  100 for every extra topping you want on it an extra dollar for tomato and lettuce seriously but they are really great burgers and the fries and milkshakes are amazing the buns are delicious and they cook their juicy patties exactly how you want it the other thing i dislike is the noise level it is really hard to hear when they call your order but i still come here for lunch simply because it is deliciousi can only say that i completely agree with everything dan n said on his review basically same experience one person in our party ordered the roll and it can only half baked with raw dough in the middle waitress got an attitude with us like it was our fault they put the roll back in the oven for a few and brought it back still uncooked now we are sitting here still waiting for the replacement to come and all are finished with our meals ughnice little place excellent service  pancakes were dry omelet was good coffee very good  its average fare but you do get a lot for your moneythis is a cute little place but it needs to define itself a little better  perhaps i was expecting too much after hearing it described as a gourmet grocery store  i was dreaming of a tiny whole foods in downtown tampa  i didnt expect the mostly nonorganic produce section to be found in a single refrigerator or to find bagged shredded cheese in the dairy section  i appreciate the low prices for the sandwiches  they are preassembled but they get heatedpressed to order  i tried the turkey reuben  something in the sandwich either the turkey or the sauerkraut was very herby and it dominated the dish so i didnt get that wonderful reuben harmony i expected  it was disappointing  i probably wont return for a sandwich but this is a nice place to grab a bottle of wine or beer and maybe some gourmet snacks  this is certainly not a replacement for a real grocery storelocated on lower level section by the pool entry offering predictable grease bombs home of burgers and fries if there are others in your party not wanting burgers go to the caf   onion rings were great but could not substitute for fries in meal deal so had to order separately   every 45min or so they turned up the music really loud for 1 song and staff including manager featured  dance choreography to entertain   to sit sooner than later they split up my 8 person party to two tables offering to move a table up to a booth when other customers finished we were settledresolved to it by then but it was nice they askedcame in for a midweek lunch with a coworker  service is casual on the friendly but brisk side which was not a problem the presentation isnt fancy its definitely simple with light decor  i ordered a croquemonsieur which came nicely toasty with a generous helping of sliced tomatoes the sandwich itself was quite nice with flavorful ham unfortunately the tomatoes were on the mealy side and didnt add much to the plate  overall a very middleground experience perhaps another dish will hit the right spot some other time definitely a big plus that they are attached to la baguette treat yourself on the way outthe food here was much better when it first opened  still a solid and easy bbq and meat option just not enough to go 4 stars even  the meat is good  the sides are what has declined their biscuits arent that great  a little too dense  nice selection of dessertsa much better tour than miller coors but still too big and way too long although it was cool to see some clydesdales up close i couldve done without the 20 minutes in their barn  if youre interesting in brewing beer id say the tour is actually quite informative unlike miller where they mark off how many drinks youve ordered busch is a little more lax although youre technically only allowed 2 beers each they dont use tickets or markers so its quite easy to sneak in a few more samplesim pretty mixed on this place service was great super happy and friendly price was right a buck a donut or less if you order a bunch is just right  selection was excellent and a lot of donuts were kept in a warming oven so that it would be served warm  all that was great but i didnt think the donut was anything special  i got a cinnasquare and it was just a really sugary donut  not so much cinnamon square doesnt affect the taste sorry to say  i cant speak to the other donuts and there seemed to be a lot of regular customers slamming this place so perhaps i should have gone with the pbj that got many positive comments on the spot  compared to dunkin id come to this place but any other local donut place this is just oksandwiches and sides during lunch were ok but we had poor service after our server delivered our food he never did check back with us finally had to flag him down to get what we needed in the past cheddars was enjoyable but the last few visits havent beenthe 30th street cosi doesnt feature anything special that sets it apart from any of the other cosi locations in the city say rittenhouse or 36th and walnut but it works for when im en route to the train and craving a hot drink or something to munch on and a wifi friendly spot if i have time to kill  my usual if im sitting in for a meal is the pesto chicken melt or a chicken margherita flatbread pizza but its highly unlikely that will happen at this cosi  only if i miss my trainnot a bad place for a sandwich or salad  focus on fresh and healthy food  flatbreads made in storei had an our to kill before meeting some friends so i stopped in for a cup of tea and a snack unfortunately they were out of the tea i wanted so i settled for another type and the spinachfeta pastry that i had was yummy i wish it could have been toasted rather than heated in the microwave  the staff was nice and apologetic about the missing tea the space indoors is cozy but the tables are pretty well spaced the front patio area is spaciousif sitting near veterans hwy is your sort of thing  so lets discuss why this shop gets 3 not 4 stars the parking lot sucks because the space has a drive through parking spaces are almost nonexistent and all the nearby businesses have threatening signs about parking in their lots with dire consequences promisedthis is apparently a favorite among some folks i work with but last night was the first time id tried it im glad i did  the upstairs seating area was pretty sparsely populated on a wednesday night but there were some folks watching game 1 in the bar downstairs  we knew about it because of the hoots when something good happened for the cards   the drink menu was diverse and yet manageable quite often when i go to some restaurants in places like st louis or denver the drink menu seems to be competing for who can use the most trees to document the amount of alcohol they have available for someone who is terrible at making choices i hate those places since theres just too much good stuff kudos baileys range for helping those of us who are indecisive  i ended up ordering a red wine to go with by burger  interesting choice i know but i was not feeling beer last night for whatever reason i ordered the smoked burger which has caramelized onions and cheese and rooster sauce it was awesome the bun was soaking up all the delicious grease from the cheese and the meat and the whole experience was just great   i would definitely recommend this place for burgers  there wasnt much else on the menu to choose from but this would be a great hitthespot place for a burger cravingtried this placed based on yelp reviews  beef brisket  tendon noodle soup was as most reviewers report  delicious  pancake wrapped pork was a new dish to us and very good as well  we also had mango and blueberry fruit slushes  refreshing and tasty and probably not easily found in reno  the disappointment however for me was the pork chow fun  the noodles were oily yellow like they were egg and not rice and a bit chewy versus the usual wider white ho fan ribbon noodles  dry fried chow fun typically has brown char marks from wok frying which provide the flavor and these noodles didnt seem like they were fried  a better nearby choice for chow fun imho would be pho mein in the el doradoi had lunch buffet on sunday the food was alright i wish the buffet trays were warmer i think the best dishes were their fresh nans and green peapaneerwe chose this establishment because it was adjacent to our hotel and didnt really want to leave since we had just driven over 5hrs we were seated immediately and orders were taken we both opted for the steak tips special i informed the waiter id like my steak mediumwell he said they only fixed it one way mediumish at that point i became scared i will not eat meat that is red i have never ordered steak and not been asked how id like it cooked ever once food arrived my husband said the salad was the best hes ever eaten but the steak was definitely cooked medium i didnt order a side salad i opted to eat the smaller pieces as they were cooked to my liking the onion straws that were under the steak got me excited because they are my all time favorite side item but they were chewy as if they had laid under a heat lamp a little too long and were not fresh i was very disappointed in this 80 meal had the steak been cooked medium well and the onion straws fresh this meal wouldve been delicioushad a panini and a chocolate chip cookie from this place for a quick lunch on a trip to nashville was very impressed with the quality of the bread and the cookie the sandwich overall was just a fine standard panini but i did enjoy the seeds present in the bread and id like to go back and try something else next timewell lets start with the good panera type restaurant with good food and laid back atmosphere now with the bad a focus on the staff every time i go up there the staff seems to really hate being there or has an attitude youd prefer not to see when walking in a place it actually makes me not want to go up there for food anymore definetly not world class customer service on any scale and the sad thing is they barely have to interact with yougood food but the quality doesnt seem to justify the prices  seems they should lower the price point by a dollar or two for the entrees 16 for a bowl seems a bit steepi love poke bowls i became obsessed in cali so much delicious fish at such good price so much cheaper than sashimi so when this place opened i showed up on the first day i couldnt wait but unfortunately i was let down  1 they were really friendly 2 i got the biggest bowl 1195 and i was highly disappointed at how small it was also they gave me very little fish  3 when we got to the veggies the owner told me i could pick whichever and how many i wanted so obviously i picked one of each  4 when paying somehow my order went from 1195 to 19 something   they had charged me for some of the extra veggies but he never told me about that or else i wouldnt have picked one of each  overall i will give it a try in a few months once they are more established bc i want so bad to have a poke bowl place in the city there will be another poke bowl restaurant opening soon in chinatown so hope that one is better than this oneim loving this whole fresh local food trend it makes me feel so healthy even though it may not be   so the last time i was there i ordered the spicy avocado and lime kale and grain bowl it was delicious it was so filling that i was able to share it with someone else the fiancee ordered the buffalo chicken burger and wasnt all that impressed he said it was kind of boring so i guess its a hit or miss depending on what you order  my only complaint would be some of the employees  having to deal with unpleasant people kind of ruins your dining experience just a bitfood was good service was great we all liked the beer variety and the bourbon list is amazing we started with pork cracklings and fried green tomatoes you dont get many cracklings but they are really good the tomatoes were actually cooked almost perfect a few were alittle dark but still delicious i order smoked sausage it was more like a spicy smoke sausage you buy at your local price chopper note this i thought i was ordering a sausage plate but i only got a bare plate full of sausage no sides no bread my wife got the veggie burger and sweet pot fries burger was so so fries were good the couple with us said they liked theres so i cannot contest the service and atmosphere is where it was at oh i did try some of my buddies pulled pork and it was really good remembered now cause i wish i would have ordered ityou know i keep giving these guys a chance in hopes that they will improve they have not  i had to clear my throat loudly to entice someone to come from the back to actually help me  i was in on a sunday afternoon and while they werent busy there were hardly any cupcakes to purchase i was surprised by the lack of variety despite being there with over 3 hours of business hours left until closing the two cupcakes i purchased were lemon for the wife and a chocolate caramel pretzel combo of some sort once i paid for them i was anxious to eat mine   i got them home and once we had lunch it was time for dessert my wife tried hers one bite was all she took to be done she said it the icing was too sweet and the cake too dry i felt the same about my mine also the caramel part in the description was not at all present in my cupcake it really amounted to overly granulated sugary icing with crushed up pretzel bits on top the frosting had crusted over so it clearly wasnt fresh the cake was also dry so it too wasnt fresh you are a cupcake place that only makes cupcakes but you cant do that well clearly this just doesnt compute  next time i will save myself from these dry cupcakes and make my ownjust had lunch there ordered the red bean and rice meat lovers classic it was had good flavor the portions are huge for lunch and the prices are great just wished they had more dinner items on the lunch menu was craving pasta  none available on the lunch menumore than just ice creami walked in the door hungry as all hell ready to rock out i started off with an order of hummuswhich never came  my lady friend ordered a bowl of the turkey chiliand i am glad she went with a bowl versus a cup because wellthe hummus never came the turkey chili was quite delicious and i give it a good recommendation   i elected to go with one of the days specialswalnutencrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables what does that mean exactly parsnips instead of potatoes parsnips and potatoes i am pretty sure there was no yucca involved lol i digress the mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though the string beans tasted of charred water the walnutencrusted chicken was a tasty idea but the crusting was quite overcooked again lending a burnt flavor the chicken came covered in a maple gravymild taste of maple and it was a cream gravy i was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor  the waiter did not bring me a knife and fork which was his second strike after the missed hummus i was so hungry i did not care however i cleaned my plate thoroughly   on to the ice cream my lady friend and i split a belgian waffle topped with ice cream as the man the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor i went with cinnamon bun and it was great the waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top the creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamonsugarized butter  wowzers   the service was a little sketchy and i had some issues with my entree but i would definitely come by and give them another chance i recommend you do toowent there today for dinner with family  service was ok drinks were pretty weak everyones food quality and taste was fine bbq ribs were barely above room temperaturei love starbucks but not this location the customer service was not up to par  my friend and i came in to have a passion fruit ice tea and enjoy our time together the barista was not helping to invoke the essence of starbucks he was rude while taking our orders and did not have a smile on his face whatsoever  he seemed like he did not care to be there and just rolled his eyes whenever we had a questionnot cool at all  once again i love starbucks they just need help being more friendly towards peoplei got the beef chow fun and it was okay the beef was very fatty but the noodles and flavor were great the place is kind of hard to find which is a down fall boba milk tea was good  something along the lines of a chain chinese restaurant but packed full of peoplei love their frozen custard so creamy and good yummmmmmmmy not an everyday dessert because its super duper rich but perfect as a special treat  okay on to food ive only eaten here once and its not the greatest burger wasnt very good and fries were a little old but i took a bite of my friends fried chicken sandwich and it was better than what i orderedeat upstairs for a great view not the best but not the worst food i would probably go againdefinitely not the best donuts in town but props for creativity if you like waiting in long lines only to be rewarded with a diabetic coma strange donuts is for you sd is a fun novelty donut shop that overdelivers in presentation and variety but lacks in terms of actual donut quality i love the whole concept of introducing collaborations with other local haunts bogarts mai lee very stl spirit however i think the most effective collaboration they could pursue would be one with donut drivein maybe someone could help them with their overall donut execution my critique of sd comes from a place of love ive been here 3 or 4 times but each time im let down when it comes to the actual taste of the donuts conceptually they have amazing offerings but if you just want a goddamn donut this shouldnt be your first stopjust outside of downtown tampa this spot is a good place for meeting a friend or business associate for coffee if they dont want to deal with parking downtown   seriously the place is really cool theyve recently expanded to occupy the entire building so there is plenty of seating inside the look of the place is engaging and useful the community table spaces are comfortable and the other random seating arrangements breakup the space very well  the service is always friendly and personal and they serve good coffee too  the biggest challenge to the location is parking taking the hart 30 that runs along kennedy is a good alternativegood location pleasant atmosphere and super cute designs on the lattes ordered a mocha latte and vanilla latte and scone because the mocha and vanilla latte are sweetened they were good however the unsweetened latte was bitter the scone i hate to be harsh but was just flavorless also everything just felt needlessly overpricedive eaten here several times over the past few years and i have to say their service has gotten progressively better when i first started frequenting this place mainly ordering takeout it used to take a very long time for my order to be ready i would order and wait about 45 minutes before picking up and then when i would get there it would take an additional 3045 minutes before the food was actually ready so i stopped going there even though the food was worth the wait it gets old ive tried quite a few things on the menu though i usually get the fried chicken platter with greens and potato salad or the fried whiting with the same sides i have tried other sides like string beans too soft cabbage good greens good and garlic mash good their fish hoagie is really tasty and their turkey chops are as well what i love about this place is that it is black owned i also love that their food is seasoned well and their portions are big enough to feed a small family tonight i ordered fried whiting platters for my fianc and me and both had 6 pieces of fish with a heaping of sides their prices are good and i did not have to wait forever when i went to pick up my order nice job on the changes i will def patronize againdecent little dive on metairie road often empty but they seem like theyre stepping up their game with some new promotions food is pretty good especially compared to the equivalent dives in the area all in all a pretty decent place to step in for a quick drink but i wouldnt pass a whole lot of time herepei wei is the american version of the asian cuisine there dishes are made to order in an open concept kitchen the food and servive is always good i love the quick atmosphere keep in mind its not a full service restaurant  i recommend there mango california roll and there crab wontons on there main dishes they offer two different sizes make sure you let them know if you want the small or regular because if you dont most likely the will give you the regular and trust me its a nice portion     we have eaten here many times and always enjoyed itservice was not bad and the steak chimichanga i had was great the house margarita was terrible watered down and hardly any tequila made me ask for a new one after the new drink it was still watered down but much stronger too strong definitely wont be drinking here again but wasting wise its not bad at allgood craft beer reasonable prices i had a pizza that was awesome one daughter had a steak that she really enjoyed another daughter had a huge tasty burger wife had a salad that had one ingredient she didnt care for artichoke hearts i think definitely a welcome addition to the area the only negatives were the hostesses and the speed of service the hostesses ignored me upon arrival then acknowledged and seated the next family that came through the door then they tried to seat us at the worst spot in the restaurant when more desirable tables in the main area were open food came out really slow the family that was seated just before me finished and left before our food came outthe location is hard to get into and out of but its nice inside and has a decently large menu the pho isnt the best ive ever had but its hard to mess up pho it was pretty good and the portion was pretty big for 8 the main issue was that it took 19 minutes to receive my food i paid and sat down and i waited and waited and waited my receipt was time stamped so thats how i know it was 19 minutes they were busy so i guess if i ever come back i will try not to come back at such a busy time all in all not bad i may or may not be back but if youre nearby stop on in its pretty gooddinner here was great until the very end but my opinion was definitely soured by being informed we do not accept credit cards only after i went to pay with a credit card i checked the doorway on the way out  nope no sign there was nothing on the check to indicate they were cashonly i dont remember seeing it listed on the menu and i look for these things while dinner was delicious that is a customer service fail that left me lessthanimpressed   up to that point though i very much enjoyed my dinner here we started by sharing an order of spring rolls two large rolls were served cut in half which was a nice portion for sharing the peanut sauce they are served with is delicious i had the panang curry always delicious although not anything particularly innovative my friends had the pineapple fried rice i had a taste  again good but nothing mindblowing and sweet basil chicken this is something i had never tasted before  yum portion sizes were generous and the prices are reasonable service was ok  there was a long wait between appetizer and entrees and for a while our water glasses were very neglected   they would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for their poor advertising of the cashonly policy if you like thai food theyre worth a visit just make sure to hit up the atm before you head inused groupon for a better deal  i was excited to try out this place because ive never ate down on a wharf before and i was in santa barbara doing sb buggy so i thought this place would be perfect for dinner   parking  can be found on the streets or public parking building or park on the wharf  seating wait time depending of if you want fa first available o outside i inside seating   i prefer the outside seating because there are more space to put your dishes and you get the view of the ocean so why not   i thought this place would bigger than i thought there are bar seating inside and table seating outside   restroom 1 only  food dungeness crab 225 lbs for 2395lb it came with a whole crab and butter dipping sauce it was fresh and tender really good recommend  crab cakes1395 it was good but nothing really special about it the tartar sauce was really good with it  calamari pasta1495 the calamari was fresh and tender and flavorful along with the pasta   new england style clam chowder 795 for a bowl of soup it was ehh i thought it would be tastier since a lot of people rave about it i would skip this  service very tentative and friendlyi have now been to chatam tap twice i like it but i dont love it  the fish and chips i had on my first visit were fine but not the best ive had but not the fish sticks some restaurants like to try to pass off as real fish either  today i had the pear gorgonzola melt i liked it because it was something different than what youd get at most places  the onion rings were huge and i think would have been  good had they not been so salty   they do have things on the menu that look like they could be good so i would go back  oh and where it says rasher bacon on the menu think ham my son who really wanted a blt was very dissappointed in his rasher bacon lti really liked the atmosphere and the fresh and yummy ingredients im still trying to find the best pizza place in reno and i give this three stars for their delicious salads and toppings but minus two stars because i like thinner whole wheat crust still doesnt compare to moms homemade pizzaswhile the service was fast and everyone seemed friendly my issue with this business is that while we were waiting to pay the person who i assume is the manager was berating an employee for not realizing a customer didnt pay for her ice cream he was doing this while standing in front of the cash register if you need to discuss something with your employees dont do it right in front of customers especially when you are being incredibly rude and over the top maybe if you had a better system in place instead of just assuming everyone around you knows whats going on this problem wouldnt happenoverpriced and understaffed let start with giant stores always have all the items and stock you need but at what cost a great cost i find giant stores merchandise is cat least 35 higher than other stores in the area acme is a very close second   if you shop after 8pm its very hard to find associates to help you locate items or answer questions on the up side the deli items are reasonably priced and fresh but beware of the seafood as its not always the freshest   in a pinch i shop here for instance on the way to work and i need to bring the drinks or dessert this market would not be the preferred place for my personal or family shopping but its clean well lit and stockedthis place is very convenient seeing how its literally downstairs great quality deli meat with bores head products but dont you dare ask for anything extra on your sandwich or salad unless youre in the mood to get sodomized they can get pricey that being said they have some great selections and are pretty friendly basics are fairly priced but frozen food is an arm and leg long review short its the same as every other convenience store but with some organic foodno more maine root no more pimento cheese its these items that made this place a go to for us no longerseemed like a typical cupcake shop the icing per usual was sweet and the prices were a bit overpriced the cupcake was good but a bit too sweet the cupcake atm is a cool idea but we didnt use it fast service thothis was a pretty tasty arteryclogging snack think tiny mozzarella sticks that have a bit more bang with the ooeygooey cheese curds i finally had the chance to try this out at the hustling and bustling jersey city project market where there were quite a few other food vendors inside and food trucks lined up outside i was surprised the cow and the curd truck had no line compared to the other vendors and food trucks then i noticed the portion size you got for 9 dipping sauces cost extra there were 8 very tiny cheese bites that fit in a little paper basket that fit inside my small hand it seemed you got a better bang for your buck at the other food spots im not sure if these are made to order or just kept warm because when i went up and placed my order i was immediately handed a basket that was just sitting there it was gooey inside but definitely not the kind of hot youd get from being pulled from the fryer im glad i knocked it off my food bucket list but i probably wont be searching them out againmake the burgers bigger or lower the priceand please dont charge for the sauces cmon buti like this place regardlessthis definitely looks like it was a pizza hut back in the 80s i would not have guessed it was a greek place judging by the exterior   its nothing fancy but i had a great lunch here huge and delicious gyros only 7 and comes with the perfect diner fries they also have wonderful tzatziki which is a must for any greek restaurantthe food took a long time to come if the kitchen had been fast i would have given it 5 starsmy husband and i stopped in for a late bite and a glass of wine on a snowy cold weekday evening there were only 5 other patrons we ordered the local beef burger which was sort of a thin patty but tasty and a pizza that was fine our waitress was friendly and pleasant the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy we would definitely go back under the same circumstances i give it three stars because of the foodyou cant escape the coffee smell that pours into the ybor streets even from blocks away at first my zombieselfcraving coffee wondered why the building was so huge when upon entering all i could see was a small shop with a couple cafe tables   interesting but through the glass behind the barista was a flurry of activity they roast and package the coffee in that building that explains the size and smell of the place plus wander into a small side room to view little coffeerelated gifts  service eh brisk and  businesslike no smiles yet hardworking eh maybe they need some of their own coffee  taste is it the barista or the coffee the coffees tastes were watered down and no amount of con leche could save itbeen here 3 other times everything was good today i ordered the steak and bacon chopped salad took 1 bite and it was terrible i put my fork on top of the salad and pushed it to the other side of the table never once was i questioned if something was wrong had to also ask for refills on tea  they must have had an off day today hopefully its better next timenot as good as you would expect i ordered a sheet cake and i said something to someone when buying it how long would it last they told me it would last at least a week the cake was like a rock the next day it was not made fresh that day more like a week before i bought it donuts are not much better either at least they lasted a day longer then the cake this place is not as good as it use to be 10 years ago its getting worse time for new owners to step in  update 5132018   new owners have taken over and my how this place has changed they have even added extra hours and have redone the sidewalks food is way better then it was finally a good bakery in the area 3 stars for now to see how things gowent here because of a coupon and its proximity to the movie theater  i cant remember what kind of frozen yogurt i had but it was just as good as any froyo store youll find these days tons of topping options i went a little crazy with that  decent nothing speciali have yet to be disappointed by the food here  ive been back a few times good burger fries milk shake  the inconsistency happens when getting my order  id bump it up a star if i actually got what i ordered but the last two times that didnt happeneasy place to get too  the meals are price reasonable  the only fault was there were a lot of dirty tablesi was told by many that the banh mis were good here but i have had better i think for the price you get an excellence size and value but the quality of the sandwich itself at least the grilled pork variety could have been better i am sure that there are better banh mi stands in the area but this one for sure is solid dont expect amazing but expect goodmy chicken was very good my 800 shrimp meal however wasnt worth the price  they use medium size shrimp the key lime pie was delicious i would go back but ill stick with chicken next timevery sweet and quaint little italian restaurant it did remind me of italy the decor and the italian speaking waiter  this place is definitely full of locals probably a local favorite they set us up at a table where we could sit next to each other as requested so nice of them to accommodate  we also brought our own bottle of wine which they charged a 30 corkage fee a little higher then other restaurants in the area the food was good my bf ordered chicken masala he enjoyed it very much i ordered the fish special halibut it was just ok a bit over cooked which made the fish taste dry we followed by ordering two desserts  affogato caffe and tiramisu both were very goodcool place to go to for a wonderful healthy atmosphere nice that you can order from a kiosk or order from a person over the counter the papaya tea is awesome potato soup is great the french baguette was nice and crunchy but too chewy for me my turkey bravo sandwich was delicious loved the tomato basil bread used for the sandwich  sucks that your view is of best buy would of rather they turned the windows into a way they could change the vie into something else food is fresh and healthy you will crave it even if you dont like to eat healthy give it a try and i guarantee you wont be disappointedahhh it is ok but nowhere near the ambiance of cafe du monde  ive never seen this place crowded so you do get super fast service  i really dont care for beignets but they have those here too and it is all very similar to cafe du monde except they also have a decent small menu of some new orleans classic dishes so i would say the dining options here are far superior to cafe du monde but a terrible location in a strip malldecent food messed up take out order the one time i did order out with them bit priceyits convenient to run here for my emergency moments ie crap i forgot to buy that one essential ingredient for my dinner recipe but its just too expensive for me to make this my regular market stop  however i will say that the service here is quite enjoyable the management definitely strive to maintain an aura of being your friendly neighborhood grocer   and while i havent stooped low enough to consider delivery i do live only a few blocks away they do offer it which is a nice plus if you wantneed it the prices are a little high for ice cream that tastes about the same at the supermarket i only got the cookie dough concrete and i will be sure to try something a bit more exotic next time to see if the ice cream is worth its price tagi love baileys range so when i was in town for just the weekend with 2 of my friends i insisted that we go there we had an average wait time about 30 mins on a saturday night which we thought was great however upon being seated we waited about 10 minutes before water was even brought to us and then waited another 1015 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink we waited about another 1015 minutes for our drinks the limoncello is delicious and refreshing for summer our food came quickly maybe 20 minutes after we ordered it came hot and delicious but we were missing sauces out of water and our server was no where to be found maybe another 10 minutes after we had gotten our food we were finally provided with more water and out sauces the food was very good did not disappoint after we were done we waited with our plates for about another 10 minutes before our serve came we then requested our checks which is the first thing they brought promptly all night we got our cards out then waited another 1015 minutes before she picked up our checks which seemed odd to me because typically turn around once you get the check seems to be pretty quick in most restaurants perhaps the server was double sat or new or something which i could understand the slowness but the server never apologized for us having to wait on her countless times   tldr the food was excellent as always but the service was severely lacking on this trip honestly bothered my whole dining experience there hopefully they do better next timeim rating this based on my yogurt and mcconells ice cream  i had the cookies and cream mcconells ice cream and it was delish i couldnt get enough the creaminess and taste was wow they have a good selection of their ice cream and i would definitely recc ppl to try the strawberry boudeux but i thought that was too sweet for my taste   i didnt like their yogurt because it was not good it was overly sweet and their chocolate well you can get it  at costco foodcourt for a better price it melts in your cup their toppings look like its been out for awhile it seems family owned    sweet alley is ok for yogurt but i think you should come here for their ice cream mcconells    its kinda pricey but its one of the few places in goletafood was good coffee was just ok  service was slow we did have a large party but it was like they were doing each cup of coffee and getting each dessert one at a time and serving us so slowly half the crowd was done before some got their first cup of coffee or anything to eat  not well organized at allbrought the kids here for lunch on easter sunday  glad we came in but it did fall short of my expectations    teen 2 insisted on onion rings and both girls wanted milk shakes  onion rings were giant good and piping hot with yummy sauce  they were absolutely dripping in grease though and there was a large unappetizing pool of grease left on the plate  better on the plate than in my stomach but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something  both girls ordered brownie milkshakes  they were delicious but tiny  i liked them so much i decided to order a peanut butter one for myself  the lack of peanut butter flavor was a huge disappointment to me  i have this problem often as i like to be positively smacked in the face with peanut butter taste and many pb flavored things fall short of this  the shakes were comically tiny for 350  i had the american burger on a pretzel bun  meat mac n cheese cheddar sauce and bacon on a pretzel roll  i didnt love the mac n cheese they used but the burger was pretty yummy and i couldnt finish it all    fries were served cold on the first goround  the waitress took them back and replaced them with hot fries without question  the hot fries were much better and the teens loved the sauces  we chose cheddar and rooster sauces  service was excellent our waitress was very friendly and we didnt want for anything throughout the course of the meal  i would try them again with a different burger and not a milkshake  kids liked it though and it was a fun and casual way to spend an easter lunchive been wanting a hot dog from a hot dog shop and there are none any where around hereso im happy  i had two chicago dogs i asked for it to be grilled i dont like boiled or steamed minus relish and it was good ive had better hot dogs in my lifetime but like i said theres nothing to compare it to around these parts the place is pretty clean the gyros smell really good so ill try that next time i only marked it down one because of the sweet tea i got it was pretty watered downhonestly a little overrated the food is average service was friendly i didnt care much for the pancakes they were dry toppings were nothing special with the popularity of the place i expected a lot more thank god the day i went i didnt have to wait long or i would be upseteasily the most elegant grocery store in reno the items sold at whole foods are seriously overpriced  thats fine if you are good with giving money away but im just not that philanthropic when it comes to supporting a corporation  while i understand the desire to get organic with it between wolf pack meats trader joes raleys and great basin coop there arent many items available here  that arent available for 2040 less somewhere else  however its so relaxing to walk the broad beautifully displayed aisles that im sometimes almost glad this store is the only purveyor of my favorite shampoo it costs me about 30 to lay in an 8 month supply  coincidentally the same time interval between my visits to this store  each time the excellent displays beckon and the gently helpful staff members rave about something new ive never tried and i end up spending another 30 on stuff i really dont need  i give whole foods credit for having the most extensive selection of teas available at any grocery store so ive made an unscheduled trip or two just to buy tea the catch if you buy one of the teas that is available locally elsewhere get ready to fork out fiftty cents to a dollar more per package to buy it here  damn you whole foods you are a bunch of robber barons whole foods ought to create an ira account for each of its regular shoppers because thats the only way theyll have any money left to retire with after shopping herethis place made an ok surf and turf plate but all and all its something you should skip over priced lowend seafood we only went for the little guy who wanted to see all the tacky decorations id never go backso im in nashville for the weekend with friends and we were looking up places to go to for breakfast in the area i had already heard about the famous pancake pantry and it ended up being the first place that came up when searching for breakfast in nashville tn so we figured what the hell lets try this place  we arrived only to find a very large line of people waiting in the hot sun for a nice table to be ready as we were not prepared to do this at this time we left to another restaurant  day 2 we arrived again only to find another very large line  day 3 we arrived once again and again found a line but said we need to eat here because it must be absolutely amazing if all these people wait in line every day   in line we went group of 8 and waited for approximately 25 minutes to be seated once we got in we ordered and waited patiently for our food i ordered the chopped ham in scrambled eggs somehow i pictured there would actually be chopped ham in the eggs but no it was served in rectangulardiced pieces just above the eggs the pancakes were served on the same plate as everything else i personally like syrup on my pancakes but dont like it on my eggs thankfully there was an extra plate on the table and i used that   my review the food was good but i wouldnt say it was great then again maybe i should have tried some of the other pancakes i got a bite from the sweet potato pancakes and those were pretty swell all in all just a really long wait which is really not good when youre hungry also waiting to pay at the counter on the way out not goodburger king is an okay alternative to mcdonalds 610 would recommend but idk about coming againasian taste inn in the huntingdon valley marketplace on county line road is a primarily chinese house owned by a guangdong province family that has been turning out pretty good semiauthentic dishes for a while  the space is well maintained with many booths and tables and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers    true to its cultural roots the cuisine tends toward sweetness and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors  our orange beef and general tso shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber or had it on the side  both were framed in broccoli florets the much overused nonchinese veggie their tastes were fine but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters  the spicy shrimp scallop  squid with pepper corn salt was a relief from the cane and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper  finally my sushi sample of an eel  avocado roll was average with much more avo than eel and artificially colored wasabe and ginger    bottom line  the suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here  everything was accommodating to the local market  too much broccoli and not enough real heat not bad if this is what you are looking forthis is not the place for me i did not enjoy the food we ordered the guacamole which was very basic and unimpressive we also ordered the idaho potato and chorizo taco the chicken tinga taco the mushroom taco and the fish taco none of these pleased me and i did not find that they were worth the 45 a taco i wont be returning to eat here   i did like the ambiance and the location of the place nicely decorated and cleanvery cool atmosphere at old glory  it is an old laundry service building and they have left some details of its past life in the new bar   i was excited to check it out because i love a good cocktail  the cocktails are good but small and very expensive id suggest to order off menu to get a better deal  now that is if you can figure out how to order  we were hanging out on the mid level and a waiter would come by every hour or so but not frequent enough to keep with the demand of my group  id probably never be back to old glory because its not my scene to clubcity for meperhaps i need to come back and order something else  but i think the food doesnt match the hype or the line  i ordered your standard eggs bacon and buttermilk pancakes and i was a little underwhelmed  dare i say that cracker barrel or ihop would have satisfied my pancake craving better  im thankful that i got to the restaurant right before the crowd started to pick up i got there around 745 am  the strange thing about eating there are the guys that continuously walk around looking for when you take your last bite  so that they can take your plate  kinda puts the pressure on to eat quickly and get up and out    bottom line decent food not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for great service and prime locationit was my last night in the nola area but i didnt want to travel far or pay outrageous prices for a meal i found carrabbas on yelp it was close to where i was staying my fried and i decided to give it a try because it could be vegetarian friendly well that does not mean it can be vegan friendly as i found out my server rebecca p was nice enough but seemed clueless as to what vegan means so we looked over the menu and i decided on a pasta dish but i would have to modify it a bit to fit my dietary needs rebecca brought us our ice tea and my friend ordered first now i know vegan sounds complicated but its not its just this nothing with a mother and no dairy or eggs so i began explaining my dish but seems rebecca was not understanding so i began to explain with my hands sort of like an italian might do boom i knocked over my ice tea all over the table we recovered and moved to another table while they cleaned up my spill mess   ok back to the ordering a veggie pasta with red sauce and extra veggies no meat or dairy i thought i got that right and that our server understood the order hhhhmmm at least i was hoping that when it came time to be served he order was wrong no extra mushrooms and not a drop of red or marinara sauce what ok the poor man serving the food it was not rebecca was wide eyed as both me and my friend in unison said thats not what i ordered our server didnt come by but juan the kitchen manager came over and asked me how he could help he took the dish back to the kitchen mixed in some red sauce and gave me more on the side then blake a floor manager and seems he was serving at the bar too came by to talk to us he was pleasant enough too now i think rebecca was flustered and didnt come by until after that she asked me if i was being taken care of and that the kitchen juan took care of the mixed up order yea it was but this should have been her job rebecca seems like a nice woman maybe she just needs to understand what vegan entails some of us have to eat this way not just because it a choice but because its about health concerns and we still want to go out and eat with our friends  i dont know if it was the kitchen or the server that made the mistake but you would have thought that with such a harsh start to the meal then a let down in the middle a discount or coupon would have been offerednothing so while we made due the mess was undone by my standards i am grateful for the effort and i would try the food chain restaurant again but ill be even more clear on my menu choices and options also it might be wise for this chain to offer at least a couple of vegan options hot and cold that are not just appetizers ill say this about juan and blake they did their best and went out of the way to make me feel comfortable and welcomed thats a good way to get repeat business next time offer the customer a 5000 coupon thats a way to secure that repeat business it doesnt need to be for me just anyone that feels a bit upside down on the menu and service loli really wish lucky goat would carry skim milk on several occasions they have either not had it or worse handed it to me and then i realized that the expiry date had passed i can imagine that i am not the only person that doesnt like whole milk or cream in my coffee it just seems to me like skim milk should be a staple at a coffee house and it isnt here other than that the service is always friendly and they have a nice assortment of fresh pastries it is for sure a welcome addition to the neighborhoodif management reads these reviewsplease consider having fresh skim milka nice clean modern look greats you as you enter whitebox it wasnt clear to me when i first entered how i was getting service as it turns out order  at counter and items will be delivered to your table this is actually my preferred type of service but it makes it a small challenge when i have my son high chair required along with me   the food was ok and the gluten free option is a great bonus but nothing earth shattering to speed along service it appears  most plate items use the same eggbake type base with different toppings wife went with a breakfast sandwich which she enjoyed but her breakfast potatoes were soft and room temperature   my son had a fruit and yogurt parfait which he demolishedbut he has the palate of a 20 month old   adding to the soso experience was a burnt cappuccino and a bottomless cup of coffee that lacked any flavor    so in summary room for improvement but fast service and filling foodsomewhere between fast food and a sit down restaurant culvers is a different kind of restaurant concept  you order at the register and then sit at a table where someone will bring you food  they focus on quality farm ingredients made when you order so expect a bit of a wait after you order  the portions are very large and the ingredients definitely a cut above expect to pay 810 for entree type items like huge hamburgers loaded roast beef and nice salads with fruit etc  known for their shakes and custard like ice cream these items are popular as well  they are very crowded so expect to wait but thats ok as it will take you quite a while to read all of the menu options and choose      the drive through is an alternate option but still runs a slower than other fast food chains  the quality wins out though so give it a try and just bring a little patience  its worth the waitwhen this restaurant first came to downtown boise i was very excited  food was good seemed fresh and somewhat healthy we ate here several times and were quite happy fast forward a year we ate here for lunch this past week two of the three soups ordered lobster bisque  clam chowder were very thin and had little substance  w undercooked celery togo cups were a little over half full sandwiches were fine hoping we caught them on a bad day i may try them again one more time and will edit review then if things changegood different menu some things are great like the pretzels and cheese and cheese soup others are a miss like the hummus appetizer and grain salad  live music was fun but also louder than we expected at a 7pm dinner on a tuesday night  great beer and great selection a lot to try more than you can get in stores  but we went for my sisters birthday and brought a cake and they charged a cake cutting fee per head  on top of added gratuity which isnt unheard of for a party of 15 but 19  the thought of asking her guests to pay and paying 50 more than the cake itself cost to eat it there was insulting so we just took it back to her house with us so they lost points for that stinginesscame down to 40th street to meet a good friend and parked right in front of tandoor india  when he arrived i asked where he wanted to go and he pointed to the doorway right behind me  auspicious beginnings first impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in  i checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow red brown and rusty sauces all looking fresh and inviting on a cold sunday night  the place was not crowded  settling in i decided to take a look at the menu because i was not in the mood for a cascade of flavors and tastes but wanted to relax with only a few  we were given copies of the take out menu which somewhat surprised me  on the cover it said we believe that the joy of eating lies in the art of fine cooking ill drink to that we ordered tikka masala with chicken which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger and was quite good the baigan bharta was tasty but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant i expected  they cheated a bit on the garlic naan by bringing us regular naan painted with garlic butter  it didnt work as it was not integrated into the bread but sat on the surface and lacked the baked garlic pieces i love in true garlic naan  a disappointing way to pay an extra buck the mango lassi was pretty good  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt  a nice plate of rice came with the meal   this was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food  the strong brotherhood carried the day and the meal became background  for the overall experience i was quite satisfied we didnt solve any world problems but agreed we would get together soon and try againvietnamese food is one of my favs so i decided to drive a little further than i normally do to check out saigon upon looking on it from the outside it almost looks like an old wild west pub so dont be fooled like i was passed it a few times ordered the pho and spring rolls with bubble tea pho was good not great little bland the spring rolls were pretty good i think whoever made the bubble tea forgot the tapioca balls so they where placed on top of all the ice but after the drink melted a little bit it wasnt a problem service was pretty good overall not overly impressed far from a bad experience but would like to see the flavoring develop a bit morefrankly i expected more  i had heard raves about how great their desserts were  they certainly sounded tempting and they looked pretty but i just wasnt wowed  portion sizes on the meals were a bit small for dinner but were tasty and the french onion soup was actually really good  i resolved that i would return for lunch but probably not for dinner and id still always choose riddles for dessertsmy girlfriend and i went there for an early lunch on a sunday morning shortly after they opened up i instantly noticed the dirty floor and the sticky table once we sat down then we were given the menus that actually had food pieces on them i didnt want to gross out my girlfriend so i didnt say anything food and service and price were all very good its a shame they didnt clean the place otherwise i would have been happy to give them a fivestar i assume that saturday night was busy and they just didnt clean upmad mex is fine  we expect it to be crowded every time we gowhich is is  the crowd is really diverseit seems to have a big college appeal but there are also several families and people going on dates my husband summed it up perfectly the other day with have we ever ordered anything we really liked there  the food is expensive and mediocre at best but the drinks are pretty awesome  we would easily go there just to have a margarita or sangria  all the staff is very friendly and the bar moves quickly even when its swamped  over all not a bad place but not the best eitherthere is room for improvement in their customer service  we called at 500 on a saturday but no one answered and no one returned my call  so we went there  the hostess told us there was open seating upstairs but when we got upstairs another employee told us the seats were not open seating  so we sat at the bar  they were out of three of six beers and they forgot my dates water  that said the appetizers and beers we tried were good  they had a sour beer on tap which is hard to find  i think with more experience in customer service this place has a lot of potentialsince they dont take reservations on weekends i wasnt terribly surprised that they had some difficulty accommodating 15 of us when we walked in to their credit though we were seated at a 12top plus nearby 4top within about 10 minutes  the outside beer garden was underlit once the sun went down and it was pretty loud once the band started playing folksy bluegrass music food and service were good and i definitely recommend the beer biscuits however be aware that desserts are all sized for 4 peoplei havent been overly impressed with the food but i think its because i have pretty simple taste the oj is really good but i wish they had lattes instead of just coffee fruit and granola is tasty but had a grilled cheese that was really oily and heavyhaving no bags is really frustrating especially since their reusable bags are 23 and they dont even offer you to use boxes as a for of taking out your groceries this place was recently remodeled and it is wayyyy too huge in my opinionso i needed dinner this place is close to home a burger sounded like a good time   the good  burger was yum el matador  they have a good beer selection  the staff is nice and attentive   the not so great  burger and fries didnt come out at the same time  i spent 3400 for a burger fries and a beer this included the tip i left but 34 bucks for a freaking burger fries and beer come on dude   ill be back but for the lunch special which looks to be the best time to goordered a burger and fries great tasting the staff is straight and to the point you might even think there rude they just come off that way when you get there sit down and order  weather your taking out or eating there its fasterafter trying this place for their shaved ice which is by far the best ive had i decided to stop in for a light dinner one evening i ordered the spicy green papaya salad and an order of shrimp fresh rolls i really wanted to like the green papaya salad but it was served warm and had some flavor combination that threw me off maybe i disliked it due to my preconceived ideas of what i thought id be getting who knows  the shrimp fresh rolls were standard and tasty but the peanut sauce was rather runny making it hard to get the flavor to stick to the roll  ill continue to go for the shaved ice which is like snow from heaven in your mouth go try it just for thatslowest service ever  was not crowded at all so we picked a booth to sit at  we were ignored for about 10 minutes and decided to move to another booth in the front room  after a few minutes we were finally acknowledged  we ordered right away as while we waited we grabbed out own menus  after ordering it took another 10 minutes just to get the waters we asked for  thank god it wasnt crowded because brenda appears to be the sole cook  it seemed to take forever for our food  once we got it i was actually pleased with my meal  however because of the service alone i dont think i could go back and sit therethis is my longest review because the service was pretty terrible so i have a lot to say   my boyfriend and i had bought a groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner this place is cute small and intimate we were greeted by a women in a tshirt which i thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant she sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it we assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress as we waited for someone to take our drink order it was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice when we figured out what we wanted the women in the tshirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet  my boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes so he told her we are ready to order when she was she then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips  we both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy we asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic she said she didnt know and just stared at us my boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check she informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didnt eat them we ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla the menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn our waitress was very confused as to why i was specifying corn tortillas because she said we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones i wasnt going to argue because i wanted corn at this point she still didnt take out drink order she placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil so i asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said i dont know and stared at us again my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us at this point i imagine the owner or manager got involved he said he would cook everything in olive oil and let me tell you the food was delicious we were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there after the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate i cant say enough about how good that mexican food was  i got the check and the bill was 3025 which was perfect because our groupon was 30 and our card could be charged 25 so we could tip the waitress i always tip regardless of the service some people have bad days the check came back of wrong not surprised and she took 25 off our bill so i showed her its 30 not 25 so i hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the 25 difference  she comes back the bill saying it was now 28 and we had no bill after the groupon i explained i only had my card and i wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for 25 she stared at us and said uhhh i dont know my boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it i did feel bad but my boyfriend even said she made the decision on not taking a tip pros great environment               great food               byob               accommodating to food allergies if you asked someone other then the waitress   cons  the service it was enough to not go back unless the manager agreed to let me take own order and personally give it took the cooks also help ourselves to some waterbecause the waitress wont its a shame because the food has been amongst the best it could have been our new favorite placewell as with all things in life my opinion on local taco has somewhat changed some of that was me just kind of changing my mind about things like flour tortilla tacos and some of it was the discovery of some pretty delicious stuff on their menu the enchiladas  all of them i still would probably go elsewhere for tacos but for enchiladas this place does the trickwe drove by this place and decided to check it out  although its already  past their closing time 7 pm  some customers were still in there so they sold  us a cup of halo halo  it had all the goodies jello flan ice cream shred ice sweet beans  sweet  condensed milk etc it was a   rich delicious dessert big enough for two people to share next time i will come not too late and try other dessert treattough crowd  coffee depends on the quality of the water  here you might want to have it tested definitely has an unusual aftertaste  still it was potable and left no lingering aftereffects    cant speak to the sweets but the bathroom was tidythe food was pretty good for quick serve  they did get the order wrong but the customer service made the wrong right salad was fresh  tasty husband enjoy the buffalo wings they were not the best but not the worstbeen there twice because it use to be right around the corner  its not the worst place but their claim of making any flavor you can think of isnt exactly all that genuine  the staff is young and cute and clean the prices are high  id still rather go to shake shack even if its not as healthythe appetizers are so en pointe and amazing sampler plate was fantastic thats why the entrees were such a disappointment in contrast  pad thai and clay pot were kind of gamey and over seasoned  maybe other things are better but if i come back id stick with apps and order pork spring rolls crab rangoon omg pillows of amazingness and beef lemongrass  the apps were 4 star the entrees were 1 starthis is a pretty average place and nothing to write home about the food is good but can be a little dry at times service is not especially friendly or quick but management is visible and tries to stay on top of thingswhats up with your night well why not grab a classic tony lukes jerseystyle cheesesteak and hit up the bar connected to the bowling alley   bowling alley cheesesteak chain with a dive bar okay i am cringing on the thought of how embarrassing that sounds for nj but regardless thats how the good old garden state represents i met up with my group of guys and gals surrounded ourselves with our glorious looking cheesesteaks filled up on drinks and sat around bsing the night away at the bar aw yeah a laid back night with food and my buds  at tonys you can order cheesesteak substitution chicken steak available burgers fries and your standard fried grab and go grub my cheesesteak was served on a fresh roll with american cheese that complimented the steak with fried mushrooms with a handful of fries it was all washed down with a cold one from the inside bar now it wasnt by far the best cheesesteak ive had but right square dead in the middle of good and average  despite the sticky floor and fact that my shoes felt suctioned to the ground service was decent the cashier takes the order lists your name and when theyre ready its announced on the loud speaker the loud speaker shout out is clutch because there is no need to stand around awkwardly waiting you are free to roam around and come or go in the end dinner is served and without ever paying a bridge toll to phillys real tonysso im a bit disappointed in this place i actually really enjoyed blue bear and the crazy cocktails they had concocted this place falls quite short of the old bar the beer menu however is extensive which will be a draw for many i had a decent beer after describing the to the bartender what i was in the mood for i am no connoisseur so i definitely needed help deciding he was great for this task i then decided to opt for a glass of wine as my second beverage there is no wine menu he just brought out two bottles and i chose one there was no discussion about price and perhaps i should have asked but i expected it to be in the 9 range which i would find normal if not a bit pricey at a beer bar this is no tria so i wasnt expecting the 12 charge for the wine it really rubbed me the wrong way as i said i probably should have asked but with only 2 choices i doubted i would be paying that much i probably will not return which is too bad because the beer list seems like a hithealth food overload this place looks and smells like the prototypical health food store which i do not dig call me what you will but i like my health food disguised in pretty environs like whole foods if im going to pay top dollar i dont want to feel like ive walked into a feed store  there are lots of products for lots of special needs however i found that some things were more expensive than the nearby whole foods so unless i absolutely need something that only essene has ill likely not returnwent for the free beer tasting you cannot go wrong with free beer period  the tastings apparently occur on the hour and are limited to the first 20 or so people so get there earlyish to pick up a free ticket in the meantime pick up a notfreebutquiteinexpensive pint of something schlaflys their flagship beer is a great goto and sit outside its a fun little trip with friends and doesnt cost much money  id do it again for sure  only 3 stars  because the food is only ok nothing special kinda greasythis was my first time to whitebox after seeing it in friends posts upon walking in i felt that even though its very white and modern from a design perspective it still felt warm and welcoming the employees working all had a smile on their faces and were pleasant to interact with you order at the counter and then choose a seat and they will bring your food  drinks to you the best part of my meal was definitely the latte it was delicious and i liked that you could order a 12oz or 16oz i ordered the quiche lorraine for brunch it is served with a small arugula salad the quiche is served room temperature but mine was cold like it had been in a refrigerator i asked to have it warmed up and it came back at about the same temperature it was ok but there is definitely better quiche to be had in stl the arugula salad was entirely forgettable i also ordered one biscuit with gravy on the side to try the biscuit was a lot bigger than i was expecting neither the eggs in the quiche or the biscuit were very fluffy  they were both much denser than i would have expected while i enjoyed my overall experience i felt the food was overpricedcc is good great mocha service is exceptional great place to spend the day working or studying especially because they have cushioned seats  plenty of power outlets in the bench area man they do keep it cold coldest coffee shop ive been toive seen people leave cus they couldnt feel theyre hands but it would make me buy more hot coffee   internet is slow  not too reliable not expecting super speedsbut they may want to update their router hardwareits a nice store with great italian items however i cannot get past the fact that all the clerks at this place do not use gloves when theyre cutting the meats this would not be a problem if they were not handling cash also but unfortunately they also handle the cash this is very unsanitary and its really pushing me to reconsider continue buying from this placeliked the atmosphere great cheesy breadsticks and they sell not your fathers root beer friendly staffstopped by for lunch we went to the wwii museum food wasnt too bad service was just ok since we had to carryout and put up the outside umbrella ourselvesda vincis had a 21 prime rib dinner special going and since my husband and i are suckers for food deals we decided to try it  in fact we went there for the same special 3 times  the food and service was great  my only criticism is the yorkshire pudding that comes with the prime rib  to me yorkshire pudding tastes like a greasy pancake and this was no exception dinner included soup or salad we opted for soup was very nice a butternut squash perfectly seasoned seemed like a great deal so we returned a few weeks later  on our second visitsame food same great service but upon receiving our check we noticed that we were charged 3 for each bowl of soup we asked about it and were told that soup is no longer included in the special not a big deal but it would have been nice to tell us that up front  third visit  we ordered the same thing figuring that  even though the soup portion is small its worth 3 but when we get our check it is now 6 a bowl  we asked about it and were told that its always been 6ok so i guess we were hallucinating when we thought it was 3 the week prior  in my opinion they should have continued offering the special with soup it just felt cheezy for them to take it out of the special unannounced and then double the price on a 2 ounce bowl of soup without notice my only other criticism is that without a discount or 21 special the food is overpricedi had the elk burger here and was completely underwhelmed my wife had a beef burger and she declared it excellent if it werent for that i think id give it 2 stars service was spotty at best if i went back which i might i would definitely go with the beef burger when in rome i guess but that elk burger was really not very good at all  i do not recommend it  if thats the best they got for an elk burger they should pull it off the menu decor was kinda cool i really wanted to like urban village but my visits left me slightly disappointed it was very crowded because of the basketball we quickly got seated but it was confusing because there were a lot of empty tables that for some reason we were not allowed to sitthey didnt  seem reserved   most importantly we were not very impressed with the beers my first visit and the same holds for the second visit my friend and i sampled all the of the beers and overall all the beers seemed unnecessarily bitter i admit i am biased and am not in love with overtly bitter beers and lacking in flavor i dont think any of the beers tasted like the description listed i did enjoy their malt whiskey beer   it actually tasted more like a mixed drink than a beer all in all the beers paled compared to nearby breweries like evil genius and st benjamins    their rose pizza was delicious but the fries were left in the fryer for too long and not seasoned at all also the beer cheese sauce addition was 2 dollars which seemed like a bit muchthe service was great but the cannoli wasnt it looked amazing but it fell flat the absence of pistachios on the exposed ends shouldve tipped me off if youve never had cannoli its a good starter cannoli but if youre a cannoli connoisseur like me then youll want to pass on this one   if youre ever in chicago youll find the best cannoli at ferraras original on taylor streetonline ordering  prompt delivery great cheese bread average pizza slightly underdone dough but tasty toppings i prefer the pizza from italia or steak and pizzateavana a store with a great product and great things with salespeople that will make you not want to buy it   there is something about the used car salesman take on tea peddling that turns me off teavana yet my love of their delicious product makes me push through and buy in spite of the sales people  teavana takes the sales idiom of abc always be closing to new levels they never relent and will hound you until you exit the store with or without their product   the price is not the problem the pressure is that being said teavanas website offer all the same goods same prices and sometimes more selection then the store with a lot less pressure  teavana 5 star product 1 star service  3 star reviewthis place is a great spot to sit outside and enjoy your lunch the service here is quick and the food is good my only gripe is that i feel that the food is slapped quickly together which i get is a busy place but my most recent exp my salad had just the ends of the lettuce anyhoooo this place is super convenient and its a chain so the foods pretty consistent on a good daylate review  was roaming around broad ripple after breakfast and stumbled upon this place figured we could grab a cup of coffeelatte before work the coffee was just well coffee nothing too exciting or memorable   cute little shop and kind people probably wouldnt be my choice for a cup of coffeei have been to kuzina five or six times but never left a review i made a reservation for 4 people last saturday kuzina as with many popular restaurants is much easier to get in to without a wait in the summer kuzina is in a strip mill on route 70 there are two other popular restaurants in the same strip mall the dolsot house and han dynasty  kuzina is simple and clean inside with soft colors some tasteful paintings and nice lighting i really like greek and mediterranean cuisines and kuzina has a good size menu and selection i have also been here a couple of times for lunch and they do have lunch special menu  i have tried several different dishes and the food has always been good to very good on this night i chose the lamb gyro shawarma platter that comes served with tahini sauce house side greek salad french fries and pita bread the lamb was cooked well and the pita bread was excellent the dish has some some great flavors we also shared the grilled octopus that was done nicely too  the only thing keeping me being a real fan of kuzina is sometimes the service is spotty and the balklava and desserts are just ok at best on this evening we ordered coffee and dessert this took at least 10 minutes to arrive after we placed the order and our coffee was served on the cold side the restaurant was only a little more then one half full we ordered some sort of greek cake that was dense and dry i cant remember the name  i do enjoy kuzina but i just cant give it 4 stars yet so 375 yelp stars and very close to being a fan if looking for greek food kuzina is certainly worth a visit and i will come back as  a repeat customer they do a pretty steady business also so better to play it safe and make a reservationi give this three stars because its close to my house and when wings are wanted this is our goto spot when this first opened i expected more waited a couple years and never got better so for greasy take out its good not a great atmosphere to dine ini was in the area decided to drop in gonna make this quick kinda lol it took a few minutes for the server to even notice i was there and they werent busy when she finally did she was abrupt like she was  waiting for me she started spouting out the specials before she even handed me a menu or asked if i was eating in or not honestly i was a little thrown off so i just decided on take out great reviews for the boudin balls and crackling so i went with those boudin is 2 per ball thats cool but not from under a heat lamp she was going to serve me the ones sitting in the case since i came in mind you i had used the bathroom as well so its been awhile she tells me that they rotate them fast because they also use them for bloody marys  needless to say i decided against the boudin balls and honestly just on presentation it was a pass the crackling were just ok they were hot but highly over seasoned very salty and the extra swet syrup just put it over the top its pork people it doesnt take much lol they were fried too soft for my taste and you dont get much for 5 ill stick to grabbing them fresh from the farmers market side of the road the country girl in me lol again it wasnt much food and i didnt finish them as i was standing outside a server greeted me a guy very friendly had that stay awhile nola disposition the lady wasnt rude just abrupt when its light in a restaurant thats when you should really make an impression on your guest maybe if he took care of me the feel would be different but i doubt ill be backthe food here is good depending on what you get love the black beanie quesadini and the california salad but at this particular madmex the burritos are not the best i used to go to the one in oakland pittsburgh a lot when i went to school there and the food was actually a lot better not sure what happened to this restaurant in particularthe food is good but the service here is awful  there are long lines and the staff has zero sense of urgency so you wait to order and then you wait for your foodfor a long time  a good work around is to order online and then just go pick it upa bakery  cafe that is on steroids  all form of sandwich on a variety of breads lots being on bagels and some are cold and others are hot or pressed  salads of all kinds  soups made each day  then there are the coffees and fountain drinks and desserts  open for breakfast lunch and dinner  i had my favorite egg salad on rye and was happy  wife went for a grilled cheese which i wish i had ordered  coffee for both of us  coffee was very good as it is their blend and done strong and rich   a very clean friendly and busy place  exceptionally nice people and everyone was smiling esp the employees    we were glad we stoppedi really want to give this place four stars the fact that i a person who does not really care for beer absolutely love their beer is really an accomplishment but i just cant after eating their burger its truly awful overcooked with odd offputting flavor combinations their other food isnt as bad i like the tacos  but its not really all that great either their deconstructed nachos are just ridiculous and its all overpriced add in an unquestionably pretentious atmosphere and hit or miss service and you get 3 starswe ate lunch here tuna burger chickpea and butternut squash salad  my first glass on tea had lipstick on it  the burger was ok but the bun was stale and fell apart while eating  the sweet potato fries were good  the salad was not good   the squash pieces were either over cooked or under cooked  it is a beautiful building and i feel has some good potential   the service was very good and attentive   the area is going under some gentrification but there are still many homeless in the area maple bacon donut was pretty good the donuts are actually pretty large it wasnt anything super amazing but definitely satisfied my donut cravingthe three star rating is related to inconsistency   first time i got the fried chicken  it was really salty  second time  it was delicious third time not too much flavor and greasy    i have now opted out of the fried chicken and now get the grilled chicken breast platter  it tends to be fairly consistent and tastymy problem isnt with the chesterbrook trader joes per se it is with their home office they drop items faster than you would drop a hot knife   over the years ive loved their curried tuna in pouches about a buck sixtynine in red yellow and green curries add some rice a splash of coconut milk and fresh cilantro leaves and you have a marvelous casserole i bought it the rice and the coconut milk by the bagfuls how did trader joes reward my fidelity they discontinued itsaying it wasnt costeffective to the consumer wha  over the years i bought their greekstyle spinach pie with feta cheese it was a very popular item then one day they replaced that item with a trader joes piespinach and kale with feta that new pie tasted like grass that had just been cut by a mower yuuuck their explanation they wanted a trader joes product so they discontinued the one that was better but wasnt made by trader joes  the list goes sadly on and on buy a product at trader joes like the product buy even more of the product and yethome office drops that item for no apparent reasontime after time after time  i have to admit i go to traders a lot less these days because you can never depend on a product youve supported and bought in abundance actually being there the people at the customer service desk see me coming and hide because they have run out of explanations as to why seemingly popular items are dropped  so trader joesyoure running customers off because of the abrupt changes with the availability of products in your stores   c yai never thought i would say this but this new wawa needs those little queue line ropes since the layout is long rather than deep as a store during the lunch rush the place is chaos it becomes almost impossible to navigate through because people waiting on their sandwich orders are waiting everywhere and are in the way of the checkout counters and people trying to enterexit and navigate throughexcellent quick stop for tasty nosh shrimp spring rolls were fantastic pepper chicken so so quick serviceslow service food was just ok had the beef and shrimp with vermacelli and lemon chicken only two shrimp the size of my pinky lemon chicken and beef were a step above panda express 30 minute wait for foodlocal casino gets points for not making me fly to vegas or atlantic city to gamble  that being said the casino is a bit small on the gambling floor side of things only a tiny bit of tables and its hard to find a penny slot machine    i play penny slots more for entertainment than to win anything if im looking to make money ill play blackjack  the restaurant selection is weak though the rise is flavorless and lackluster  i have yet to try this particular hard rock cafe but i have been to others and i cant imagine its much differenti stopped at kave the other day mainly because i drove 15 miles out of my way to go to golds gymbut it was so overcrowded with no parking at 915am on a tuesday that i had to scrap that idea a make other plans coffee yes please i whipped out my yelp app and found that kave express had great reviews so off i went the prices are great and they have two driveup windows for speedy service i ordered a cappuccino and it was yummy ill be honest the tip jar threw me off the entire transaction was so quick that i barely noticed the jar until the last second in that one second my mind was thinking wait a minute starbucks doesnt have tip jars should i tip or not and what thei dont even carry cash are they going to think im cheap if i drive away without tipping  i felt pressured by the tip jari really love chipotle so there is no complaints about food here  i come here a lot and half of the staff is really great just super cool and super friendly and the other half just doesnt really even pay attention while theyre making your food id hate to give this place a bad review just based on those people but it is true that a team is only as strong as its weakest link  sometimes when i come in it is only the friendly staff members and it is really a great experience   i mostly come to this specific chipotle because the location is convenient but when there is one of the fun friendly staff members taking my order it is just an added bonusif the rating was just for bagels it would be 5 stars  best bagels in lambertville  new hope area  these are ny style bagels  most sandwiches are good  blts have a generous amount of bacon  was disappointed when i ordered chicken salad on a bagel and i watched them take chicken from a can to make  if you stick with the basics you will not be disappointedive been wanting to try this place since i moved to st pete a few weeks ago im not disappointed or wowed but i will take a few more trips to this place to give a more comprehensive review   they have a decent assortment of sandwiches bagels and donuts i can tell the bagels are made fresh which is a plus i was really excited to see they have lox cream cheese so i got that on an onion bagel it was good but nothing special the cream cheese was not pack with flavor and i have had better bagels elsewhere in the area  also the donuts look good and taste average as well i got a plain yeast which was light in sweetness and texture though it kind of reminded me of the ones you can get at a grocery store   overall there prices are pretty good though my ice coffee bagel w cream cheese and donut order came to 545went to the restaurant on a friday evening and it was not busy with the exception of a bachelor party the food was not bad but okay at best the creole catfish was okay but not flavorful the seafood gumbo needed some serious help with flavor and temperature the chicken and sausage gumbo had good flavor but was warm at best the bowl was smokin hot though the fish sandwich was fair now the service was excellent cannot say enough good things about the excellent front staff the price is a bit much for the foodfree wifi and standard cosi food and prices should put this place at a 4 star  but the gruff service was a bit of a put off on the other hand the food came in 3 minutes and they got my order right so its hard to complain but seriously just smile once in a while at least one person on the staff  on a side note they have plenty of seating in the caf  a rarity for food options in the stationi came here with a colleague of mine for lunch and we were both indecisive about what we wanted to eat our choices were limited to what was within walking distance to work and i actually felt like i wanted a pizza but we were worried that pizzas would take too long i had never been to qdoba before i had seen it on several occasions on drivebys and at the airport but i never had the urge to try it my coworker assured me that it was pretty much the same as chipotle and i would have to agree with her assessment although i think chipotle is slightly better not sure i guess they are on par  i guess qdobo is the place to go if you want something really fast and easy to eat that is not pizza chinese fast food taco bell or other fast food drive throughs the portions are also very large  the burrito i got pretty much filled me up so that i didnt even eat dinner or breakfast the next daythis place is okay but a little overrated ive only been here once and my food was burnt and overpriced im not sure if id go againa cute little spot far different from the giant location they used to have in hyde park village it struck me as more of a coffee bar with pastries now although they do offer a menu with egg dishes tartines and various breakfast items they also seem to be focusing on catering  i love that they have their own parking lot just north of their store on howard avenue  you can only access it via howard though because they have the back entrance of the lot blocked off  very industrial looking inside with just a few pastry cases and only a few places to sit and eat i was helped immediately and chose from their small selection of pastries and cookies they definitely offered far more options at their old location but they still had everything i was hoping for here by far the best thing i had was the guava croissant donut aka cronut thin glaze of guava surrounded by sugary flakey goodness i felt like the guava and cheese pastry was very skimpy on both guava and cheese so it was a disappointment the apricot thumbprint cookie was good if a bit dry  i feel like i need to go back and try their coffee  they had a huge blackboard of coffee offerings and many sounded delicious  all in all its a great spot to stop in for a quick sweet treatambiance is nice they were playing current nigerian music the staff were friendly and accommodating the jollof was nicely season didnt taste like authentic nigerian jollof rice could be from another country my baked jerk chicken was ok wish it was more flavorful and less burnt skin the plantains were fresh and delicious my hubby confirmed his catfish was good and well seasoned the ginger beverage was very good we also ordered fried goat to go and were surprised by the two chops we received usually fried goat is chopped in pieces kind of disappointed i will just chop the pieces n refry myselfmaynards quickly became a tucson hotspot  the ambiance both food and drink menus and commitment to local meats and produce all impress but i found both the service and food to be hit and miss    for a small meal the mussels in white wine can be great  however on a number of occasions the mussels were fishy and inedible  i sent them back and asked when they arrived at the restaurant it was nearly a week before the waiter set them in front of me no bueno  the raclette was not memorable  their meat choices were good but no better than i could find at many other restaurants or ajs in town i did not care for the pickles  i enjoyed the roasted beets on several occasions  they were cooked perfectly the natural sugars transformed them into crispy treasures    if youre ordering cheese i recommend the humbolt fog goats cheese that resembles brie coated in chevre beemster yellow aged and idiazabal a hard sheeps milk  the current jelly served with the fromage is great on the basque sheeps milk cheese or alone    a friend ordered the choucroute garnie and liked it but others in the party commented that the sausages were nothing to write home about    i once decried that the bouillabaisse at maynards was the best in town but recently it was severely disappointing  the once rich and decadent broth is now greasy and lacking in flavor  in my last bowl the mussels and scallops were overcooked and there were only 2 pieces of onion  i will not order this again or at least will wait to taste someone elses to make sure the quality improved   the macaroni is okay a bit greasy and over salted    my favorite menu item is the potato pizza  soooooo good  its comprised of thin slices of yukon golds over a perfectly cooked crust and garlic sauce  shaved green onions rosemary and fontina make this the most memorable thing on the menu    the mushroom pizza is also fabulous  the arugula goat cheese and roasted garlic complement the mushrooms which do not loose center stage on this dish  other great dishes cassoulet pork belly braised beef   service is slow  the noise level is high and the rotating menu does not highlight enough seasonal fruits and veggies the wine choices are great and the signature drinks are good  i wish you were more consistent maynards you have great potentialbeen coming here since i was a little girl and they have amazing greek food the food gets 5 stars but service brings the overall rating down to a 3 a year ago i went in with my mom and we ordered a greek salad for two a waitress immediately interrupted my mother and i and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it at first i was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresseswaiters job to tell me what i should and should not order however it never happened before so i didnt make a big deal out of it all was well until i went back again with my mother yesterday like always we ordered a greek salad for two i proceeded to continue with my order and as i was stating i wanted a chicken souvlaki the waiter didnt even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldnt get the bigger salad itll be too much for you two to finish okay are you kidding me is this a rule in this place a rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough this isnt alcohol were talking about you cant cut me off of food the salad is not even big when split between two people it is disrespectful that the waiters and waitresses are even making suggestions like that it is rude and mind you im paying for a bigger salad rather than a small one larger billlarger tip better servicebetter tip simple as that if i get asked this one more time i might be convinced that it is a rule to tell people how much food is enough in this place   ps some people enjoy leftoversgrabbed a quick breakfast here before a tour nothing bad nothing special just a standard breakfast joint dont make a special trip here but if its on your block and you need to eat some eggs and stuff they have themhow fresh is coffee at the roastery  stop here and try it  cheap no frills good coffee   closes earlywestfield has noooooo drive thru starbucks so i was sooo excited to stumble upon this drive thru one close to my house  looki love starbucksi spend a ton of money at starbucks in return all i ask is decent coffee and friendly service i know its gonna be busy i know im gonna wait throw me an apologetic smile or something once in awhile  so when i went over the weekend and waited 20 mins only to get completely dismissed by the barista when i asked for her help in figuring out why i was so waiting for croissants i was thoroughly disappointed  when i apologized for interrupting her and kindly asked if she could help she offered nothing and said to me oh i dont do warming station my shift supervisor does and that was it you can imagine my frustration  i hate leaving a bad review but she didnt even yell for someone or point to someone or anything not cool  so when i did find my person she said the ticket never printed then walked away then 30 seconds later came back with a bag of my food she said it was accidentally left at the drive thru window the end it had been sitting there for awhileand id been waiting for 20 mins  frankly i want to give a lower star but because i received excellent service from a kid the day before who normally worked at a different store the starbucks gets an average   do better it isnt difficult to be coolso i do love this place the atmosphere is fun i like the decorating it really fits the theme the burgers are fantastic and varying options for flavor profiles are vast  i really would love to give baileys range 4 stars however given that theyre a burger establishment there is no excuse to overcook a burgerlet alone twice in a row  i ordered medium rare i got well doneumm what i sent it back and it came back very medium but edging towards medium wellsigh unacceptable that a place like this doesnt have a cooks who can cook a burger to order  id like to add that everybody else at our table who ordered medium also had theirs basically well done table of 8  id love a response from someone on this i just cant wrap my head around such a amateur problemi went in and had the andes mint cupcake hoping that my favorite mint chocolate combination would not let me down it didnt let me down but the chocolate cake was bland and not very chocolaty the whipped topping was bland as well and not even very sweet the cupcakes were overflowing out of the wrapper and the filling was not very minty overall i wasnt super stoked but i was a good cupcakegreat little shop food is fresh and tasty just like it was moms kitchen the cuban is greatgot some catered food from here for a party recently  its okay  not amazing  there are better local joints that are hole in the walls that have better tasting meat like the one on drew st  service is very good howevermy friends and i ended up here since there was a 45 minute wait at the olive garden across the street the place was not crowded so we were seated right away and our waiter was pretty consistently in our grills  we started with some delicious miso soup and hot green tea followed by the soft shell crab and veggie tempura appetizer i was really looking forward to some sushi but failed to order it because it was so expensive ha the irony in that  im sure id give the place 5 stars if it wasnt so damn expensive one of my friends and i ordered the crab cake special 2 crab cakes absolutely no filler and totally delicious with a side of steamed veggies and wasabi potatoes and were later shocked to find out this special entree was 30 it was good but come on we left very unhappy about the price our other dining companion got the shrimp pad thai which id also been considering it looked delicious from where i was sitting and my dining companion confirmed that this was true  many of the other entrees on the limited menu looked tasty so i might head back some time to try them outblush lane market is a really great place for organic products i like how everything is well organized and the products always look appealing the staff are friendly and actually seem to enjoy their jobs i havent approached a sales person for assistance but im often greeted and asked if i need help   comparatively to planet organic they have similar stock and similar prices although on occasion i have found some things to be marginally cheaper at blush lane and they seem to have more frequent sales on more items however i still shop more often at planet organic simply because parking is a bit of an inconvenience here there is meter parking on the street or underground pay parking in the roots building  but personally when im shopping for groceries i prefer the convenience of being in an out as quickly as possible   and im not sure if i just come at the wrong times but ive never seen more than one cashier on the till at blush the last particular time i was there on a sunday to purchase two items spinach and apples i ended up leaving without buying anything because there was line of several people with full carts and one cashier an express lane or selfcheckout would be really helpful i still love blush lane for its great products just sometimes its not the most convenienti recently moved across town but before i did this was my goto frys location well before they started remodeling i mean they have a pretty big clearance section where i snagged several great deals the staff was usually friendly the store was laid out with things easy to find then they felt the need to stuff a starbucks in this place and flip the entire store it became more of a hassle to shop here than it was worthi was also a little dismay that a couple of truck ran out of food around 745pm less than an hour after the event started these truck vendor must not watch tyler florences the great food truck race the supermarket is only a block away people go restock and cook again theres money to be made here and tons of people lining up for food   other than that though the event is pretty much a success since there were so many people coming out i think next time there should at least be people selling other artifacts like candles or specialty food items i was glad for the music and the liveliness i was glad for an event happening in the middle of a boring week the oxtail stew and potato salad i got was wonderful so is the fried fish sandwich its disappointing that all the taco truck ran out of food so early but be sure that i will be there again next time an event like this occuri love the food here   and the slushies of course  but the first time i came here i asked for a pretzel with mustard and they forgot my mustard  today i went for lunch and they gave me my mustard but forgot my pretzel  for some reason i end up at this wal mart when they first open around 630 as i enter the employees are still stocking shelves and arriving for work i head to the water section and pick up a case for work and head to the only check out that is open   this whole process only takes about 10 minutes this seems to be the best time to shop at wal mart otherwise it it jam packed with people  one note every time i go to this wal mart the employees stare at me while i go to get my water it is if i am an alien sent to observe the wal mart workers my guess is i am the only person crazy enough to go water shopping at 630 in the morningchipotle quality and fast service unless you are in rush hour for lunch or dinner  something inconsistent with the portion of meat i find the west chester branch much generous in their serving in here sometimes i have a few meat and sometimes a bit moredefinitely not your typical american style mexican restaurant  if mexican restaurants in tennessee could be referred to as a dive this is it courteous service helpful cook  very simple decor  concrete floor some expected hangings on the walls blanket sombrero stars piatas spanish language tv playing in the corner plastic table cloth chairs with cushions  i ordered two chicken tinga tacos and one chicken quesadilla im not adventurous and didnt want the tongue i also dont enjoy corn tortillas so my choices were limited although my grandmother was puerto rican and ive been to mexico a bunch im still more familiar with american style mexican so i stuck to safe items that i know  if i like it ill come back for more   okay im eating at home watching americas got talent  and the food is amazing  spicy oooooohwheee   i had the chicken tinga tacos spicy but put the meat into my plate of mexican rice as i dont enjoy corn tortillas mmmmm mmmm delicious   and the steak quesadilla was thick and full of stuff very plentiful no paltry quesadilla here  delicious and i will be back    only negative side is a faint smell of cleaning liquid and some flies lingering as the swinging door frequently opens and closes the kitchen is actually a food truck parked outside  also there were some kids there with other adults who didnt appear to be eating or working and all i could think was how they might wish they were homethese are hot dogs  thats it just hot dogs  granted theyre much better than the untouchable pink stuff at a carnival but still  just hot dogs with a bunch of stuff on it  i guess you kind of have to put a bunch of stuff on a hot dog to make it more palatable  so daves does that  hes managed to make basic hot dogs more palatable  cooli came here with my sister and niece so they can buy souvenirs before heading back home  the lady working was nice to my niece  there was nothing that really stood out in this store  they ended up getting some shirts and keychainsvisited with friends from out of town who dont really understand that steak n shake isnt the type of place you write a review of  you just go because its cheap and usually fast or you have a craving for cheese fries or shakes   we got 4 meals between the 3 of us since it was their first time ive been to steak n shake numerous times over my 30 years in stl and ive never gotten the chili mac5 way im glad i finally got it it was the best part of our meal note we did need to order an extra cup of chili because there just wasnt enough sauce on it   the chicago dog wasnt for me but honestly i barely like hot dogs and usually only eat them off the bbq grill when theyre close to burnt the bright green relish threw me off for sure but my friend seemed to like itate it all   the kids sliders werent a hit the 8 year old we were with was not a fan they were pretty skimpy but also the whole meal was only like 275 so i guess it makes sense we ordered a single steak burger with bacon as well and it was standardas expected it was good enough that we ordered a second one for the 8 year old after the kids meal didnt go over well   all in all the food was good service is was a bit slow and they forgot to make our shakes so we were there quite a while but the price is rightjust went during lunch on a friday not very busy and service was slow the gal who waited on me was not friendly at all however the food was good the omelet was very bland but the greens sweet potato wedges and cookie had a lot of flavor the atmosphere was swanky and cool minus the old school ceiling that aside i will be back to try something else on the menu and hope for friendlier servicei really have loved the brewpub in the past they had the best bleu cheese steak ever i still love the pub fries however since the menu changed the food kinda sucks its expensive and i used to be willing to pay that but not for their current offerings the beer is decent but there is better beer in broadripple triton or brugge the last few visits have also had really bad service which is out of character for them this was my go to place with friends but lately we chose the brugge food and beer is just betterif i had only gotten the pastrami sandwich id probably give them 2 stars  if i had only gotten the chicken bacon ranch sandwich id have given them 4 stars   but ive had both so 3 stars seemed right  the pastrami is not to be ordered here its just not good quality pastrami period rubbery and fatty are words that come to mind  however the chicken bacon ranch sandwich was excellent the sauce and the cheese made it and of course it had the bacon in it  if youve never eaten here before prepare to possibly be yelled at when entering the store theyre shouters here like at moes and usually belt out a big welcome entire staff every time the door opens its startling enough when you walk in but then picture eating in the store while the staff is screaming every 3 minutesthis pizza was expensive and only ok didnt care much for the sauce amazing cinnamon twist thoughi have been here several times  never memorablealways enjoyable  their garlic bread is outstanding and i like their sauces but the entrees are not consistent  tonight i challenged my server that my chicken had been microwaved  she denied and disappeared  she said they dont have a microwavemaybe yes maybe no  it was just extremely hot in the center and tough  at any rate we did not see her again and john took over  on a plus the hostjohnis one of the best ive run into in bucks  please will a top quality restaurant hire him  hes worth another 20 in biz  this isnt the oneconfusing menu too many nicknames and gimmicks service was very slow steak was dry and overly chopped roll was awesome place was clean and they ha a dog bowl with water and treats so three stars instead of two  cheesesteak time warp if your coming from cityreno has a lot of great ayces places this is not one of them   horribly let down by other reviewers who rated this place 4 stars fish tastes like catfood the kind of sushi you expect from the little teriyakisushi places in sacramento perhaps other guests missed this because every roll has either jalapenos or hot sauce to cover up the flavor  if reno has any taste at all this place will fail within a year    the gyoza and miso are delicious load up   edit i let them know it wasnt great and they only charged me for one roll otherwise this would be a 1star ratingwe went here on the recommendation of some friends it is not in the best neighborhood but that seems to be the state of most of greater downtown reno as the name implies it was once a train station the central area is a brew pub the dining area is a separate room away from the pub  it is a bit quieter in the dining room but noise from the pub is noticeable the food is very good my wife commented on how good her burger was it was hot a bit greasy and very flavorful i liked my fish and chips but will probably get a burger if i return if you are young and enjoy craft beer this just might be the place for you in reno me i am a few decades too old for this sceneremmies is fabulous most of the time  it is ginormous with plenty of seating but i still often have trouble finding anywhere to sit and if i do find a seat it is absolutely no where near one of the three outlets in the entire place   my weakness is chai tea and comfy sofas and at remmies they never disappoint me on either one those  the staff can get a little annoying at times some are very young and like to share their personal gossip with their besties that are usually hanging out there    to wrap this up if you can find a comfy sofa and an outlet id have to ultimately recommend rembrandts  believe me its still wayyyyy better than the itybity starbucks in eaglequite a busy place  you can drive into the pier and park at the restaurant  90 mins free with validation the cioppino which comes in a bread bowl is good but unfortunately is a bit scarce with the fish my wife enjoyed the shrimp tacos try to get a seat at one of the 4 tables outsidenever had a chance to come here for the fabled lunch buffet ive eaten here several times but only for dinner  first it seems as if their seating policy revolves not around how long youve been there but instead how many hot chicks you have with you and how much they have been drinking at the front bar  good thing i always travel in the company of attractive inebriated females  when you finally get in they have a huge menu with a really overwhelming amount of menu options  their sushi has been various degrees of quality and freshness nothing fantastic or terrible  i have enjoyed their noodle soup bowls but with that as well as most of their other menu options the portion sizes are grotesquely large  ultimately you will never have a great sushi experience in nashville or really any place that is not right next to the coast  if you think that you are you live a sad sheltered life  i highly encourage you to travel to the west coast hawaii or japan and see what youve been missingi loved mint it was my favorite then the last two times ive come they get my orders wrong sending them back takes foreveeeeeer and they forgot my coffee that they charged me for i love you mint but your service has been horrible anybody have recommendations for other vietnamese placesdefinitely worth the trip maybe even a friday night wit dunkle porter wee heavy yes dort rye no good burgers strong threei was very excited to check out this stl staple and i have to say that i was disappointed i was completely unaware that ted drewes is located 100 outside aka there is no space to sit and relax inside therefore if it is 100 degrees and you want to cool off with some ice cream you will be enjoying your ice cream outside in that 100 degree heat in addition the ice cream was completely mediocre i was expecting some wonderful ice cream and i was disappointed i wouldnt be racing to go back and visit here if i was ever back in townfood is solid and they have many unique options such as elk and wild boar definitely check out their menu if you are interested small portion compared to most burger places the only downside is that the service is super slow  not enough waiterwaitresses to be honest this place doesnt have to be a sit down restaurant and will do just fine allowing self service my roommate and i waited over 40 minutes for our burgers which was a bit annoyingthis is our usual stop for lunch driving updown the coast today the food was disappointing the lobster pasta had one or two pieces of real lobster mostly minced lobster my lobster roll was also mostly minced lobster with few whole pieces we have been here today but maybe coming after the holiday break wasnt a good idea  the clam chowder was good like alwaysgood pizza and calzones the wings arent my favorite and they are pretty slow but the pizza is really good buffalo chicken pizza is good but ask for light cajun powder it can be overwhelmingmy chocolate chip cookie was huge and tasted good but the guy manning the place was less than friendly he seemed annoyed with us and i think we were overcharged though i didnt notice until i was outside they also dont stick to the posted hours so beware we tried to stop in one night around 9 but he was closed even though the sign and he said open til 1130 the night beforethe best  deep fried dill pickles  i want more  now  but that was the highlight  i am one of those people who want my beef well done  in as humorous a way as i could manage i said burn it  i know how the chef probably feels about that but i will be happy i promise you  it arrivesmedium well at best  nope i say not done enough  the guy who brought the food out not our regular waitress so he hadnt heard the burn the hell out of it speech said its not that pink  cmon guys  im paying for it cook the darned thing the way i want to eat it  he took it back and the second one was pretty close so i ate the outside of it  it was a patty melt and there was this little patty in the middle of huge slices of bread  that looked weird  skimpy on the onions too  if i went back unlikely i would just go for the pickles and a beer  and that would be fabulousnice location and nice looking restaurant  our waitress was good also  unfortunately my husband and  i were very disappointed in the food especially for the price  we went in on a thursday evening and the restaurant was nearly empty which should have probably been our first clueso sad my second time eating here was nothing like the first sandwich was bland and the vibe was the same i felt like i was one of the herd at the school cafeteria  i like being thanked for spending my time and money at a place not made to feel like im asking someone to go out of there way to make me some lunch  dont just exchange food for money be elated someone chose your place  sara b says no when i say everyone is entitled to an off daybut it was an off day at urban eatsfood is good manager is great kitchen timing needs work  3 of 5 dishes 2 lasagna 2 ravioli and 1 chick fettuccine came out then we waited 4 minutes for another lasagna and the capalini and meatball the kitchen is that small they cant time the dishes to come out sure its italian mangia mangia so you dont need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold  that said the food was very good i love to try the variety of lasagna in santa barbara the largest portion but not the best is from arnoldis cafe trattoria vittoria when its done with lamb is my favorite but a big round of applause for tre lune the bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned im a sucker for lamb ragu this is the dish to beat  while im disappointed at the delivery minus one star the food was very good 4 star ill ding them today but certainly return for more lasagna youve won my heart over trattoria and thats hard to doonly had the fried chicken but it was hot and fresh young man working the driv ebb thru was very nice and politecome for the latte and specialty drinks if youre around the neighborhood they serve only breakfast and lunch we came here for brunch and ordered fisherman omelet hangover hash and sombrero frittata they overcooked the eggs as we wanted overeasy for the hangover hash but the spicy siracha mayo complemented the dish full of sausages and potatoes to add a little flavor sombrero frittata didnt amaze me since it has avocados mixed into it and a side of toast that was a like biscotti the dish was pretty bland and i was expecting avocado slices fisherman omelet was a nice portioned meal but a little seasoning would be great my friend asked if it had came with toast the waiter said yes but none was servedserver was fun and quick at first when it was time to go she disappeared    food was tasty enough nothing amazing  but just good enough not to say no if someone says they want to come back  not going out of my way to go therethe food took nothing short of an hour to get to the table but once it got there it was tasty sadly we forgot the b in the byob so will have to go once more in hopes that the service is betterits just one giant room theres no flowthrough for the meandering crowds its all just one big long irritating room youre either being crushed in the front or bumped into by passing patrons in the back   cheap huge strong drinks bigger than normalsized shots i got impossibly hammered here but was frustrated with the layout  ill probably go back because they host good showssince our usual late night jersey diner that we grew up with is a little charred right now rip cld for now we are on the search for our new one   im pretty sure late night service for the westmont diner is a new thing we went at about 1am and got seated right away the waitress was friendly but i didnt notice anyones drink get refilled the whole time   i got a western omelette with just egg whites and it came with seasoned potatoes the omelette was a little watery but the potatoes were pretty good the seasoning was almost like an old bay type thing   maybe its just the time we went and maybe i will give them another chance but as for now we will keep searching for that latenightsouthjerseygemthis idea is adorable i would like to say that the giant fortune cookie definitely needs some work though  im pretty sure i lost a tooth or two trying to eat it this rockcookie was also burnt on the edge i would suggest ordering something else from them other than this unless you want to just look at italways good service need plantbased food options all locations i have noticed much better snackswent here for dinner the other day and was not super impressed   here is what we ordered a pinot gris b cheese plate blue cheese brie and goat c ceasar salad and french onion soup d eggplant parm and gnocchi  the pinot gris was a 30 bottle from the wilammette valley the funny thing about this was after we ordered it i could see them scrambling to find it i almost thought they were going to come back and tell me they ran out it did take a while for them to come with our wine  part b the cheese plate was aok i liked the blue cheese and goat cheese but i found that there was hardly any brie for two people whats up with that also the toast pieces were a little oily distracted from the cheese flavor and there should have been some variety  for part c the ceasar salad was pretty bad they said they make their own dressing but i could barely taste it on the lettuce i was also not a fan of the shredded cheese on there it should be shaved imo  the french onion soup however was solid in fact it is truly vegetarian so thats a plus    part d the main entrees were both just ok i did not love my gnocchi and am sure i have had better even i prefer the gnocchi at mad tomato down the street something about the flavor of the gnocchi was off the veggies that came with the dish were nice though   the eggplant parmesean was pretty bad the eggplant was tough to eat and the tomato used was meh overall the dish lacked excitement and i did not understand the green beans and potatoes that it came with the potatoes by the way were very bland and boring  there were some off things about their service besides taking a while to bring out our wine they took forever to bring out the cheese plate and then forgot to bring us plates for it then since we were sitting very close to the door we noticed a lot of people come in and not be seated right away when there were open tables on top of that when people would come in the freezing air would blow our way brr  i dont think our waitress ever came by to refill our wine glasses but i think i was able to manage that one however she was almost nonexistent the entire dinner which i didnt like   overall the french onion soup wine and the cheese plate were good but nothing else really was too excitingfour of us stopped in for a quick lunch on a sunday in february we walked through the deli to the balcony along the back found a table and ordered cuban sandwiches and salads eventually the drinks came and then 45 minutes later the food arrived everything was tasty the only reason our rating is not higher is because of the long wait for our food we would definitely go back thoi really enjoyed my experience at taqueria del sol  the service was very friendly and quick and everything was very well organized  they have you order before youre seated and then they bring the food to you  they have a nice menu selection as well as margaritas and a variety of mexican beers  while i was waiting in line i noticed that they offer 10 off your check if you check in to taqueria on facebook  i did so showed the cashier my checkin on my phone and was given the discount  i ended up getting the fish taco and the memphis pork taco  the pork taco was the more dressed up of the two tacos with a bit of slaw and a red sauce  i really liked it  i liked the fish taco as well  good flavors but a little bare bones  it had a good sized pieces of fish but other than that just some sauce and maybe three pickled jalapenos  its not that it wasnt good but i felt like it looked a little naked  my husband enjoyed a fish taco as well as a fried chicken taco and a brisket  he liked the chicken taco and while he liked the brisket he thought that needed a little something more  he found it to be mostly just meat  several people seemed to have a salsa trio as a starter it comes with chips and we think it would have been nice to have that to add to our tacos  they dont seem to offer any salsa on the side though we didnt ask    i would say these werent my favorite tacos of all time but they were very enjoyable  this is a great place to stop for lunch or dinner in a very casual but friendly atmospherei was excited to try this place after the excellent yelp reviews but was not as impressed as others seem to be  mostly because of the cost of my drink i ordered an iced latte the smallest size was 16 oz which was fine but i was charged 529 for the drink this seems very steep considering i like to leave a tip whenever i buy a drink at an independently owned coffee place i walked out of tin comet with a decent iced latte but if im forking over more than 6 for a very basic espresso drink this isnt a place ill return to frequently if at alli really like this bakery because they are not highway robbers their prices and portions are a good value for the money  i absolutely love their old fashioned cheesecakes  only 550 for a small what a deal   cinnamon buns with cream cheese icing  these are fabulous these rival cinnabons at the mall but are less expensive here a must try  now comes the badbutter cake  i have been eating butter cake from philly my entire life unfortunately the two bakeries i used to buy it from closed fritzs gooey recipe tastes very good but it is missing the cake bottom its all goo and should be called butter soup there is no cake you have to eat this with a spoon or where a bib unless you refrigerate it and get it colder to thicken up we bought five of them yesterday between the 3 of us and will never buy them again i am on the hunt for a better butter cake  all in all fritzs bakery is a good bakery to go to  the prices are good and i will continue to be a customer but not for your butter soupmy husband and i trekked from memphis to st louis at the beginning of april for the uswnt soccer game at busch stadium we arrived in st louis with a few hours to spare before game time so we headed over to a burger joint baileys range for lunch i had found it ahead of time via yelp naturally this restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons after fasting for good friday a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles french fries and an icecold coke sounded just right the space itself was very neat with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas there was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant which we sadly did not partake in   the service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once   we started with the fried pickles appetizer the batter was very good and i was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles we then each ordered our burgers me  the basic burger my husband  the american burger both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice but nothing to write home about the standout dish was the french fries note  the large french fry is huge two people could easily split the smaller portion the ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting  was there ginger in there who knows but it was good i would definitely recommend this burger place to anyone traveling to st louiswas there for the all you can eat crab legs on a weds night with our family from the uk  the waitress left a lot to be desired the vegetarian options are extremely limitedas one might reasonably expect at a smoke housei know but the crab legssnow not king were great  the atmosphere was pleasant and all in all it was a good nightjust had a classic wawa chicken salad hoagie i topped it with spinach american cheese sweet peppers pickles and both spicy and honey mustard pepper was also added   what i unwrapped was essentially chicken flavored mayonnaise the toppings and mayomustard sauce were delectable on the soft roll but i was really hoping that i had gotten more chicken there are three reasons that could be contributing to my dismay they could occur either in isolation or some combination of the three  reason one  the bottom of the chicken salad container this area of chicken salad contains mostly mayonnaise and smaller chicken particles   reason two  lunch hour i was order 198 the sandwich being called at the counter was in the 178 range at this time i feel that the fine luncheoneers at this particular wawa could have felt the pressure of the lunchtime rush   reason three  hoagiefest im sure that everyone is familiar with our favorite three month sandwich discount more recently the rolls moved from 12 to 10 inches could it possibly be that this is solely a marketing campaign and not a celebration of the worlds fourth greatest sandwich  wild card location there is not another wawa in this area for what in my estimation would be a 3 mile radius partially a manifestation of the lunch hour component   two stars for wawa is a bit harsh so due to past experiences with the wawa chain they earn three starsi had a quad expresso this morning i really like this coffe shop nice prople and great service  better than my first visit but still learning to appreciate their blendmy husband and i found this place wandering around downtown not a whole lot going on down there huh and decided to try it we got the fried pickles and loaded fries for appetizers i had a small fried chicken salad while my husband had the wicked apple burger he had a beer and i had a strawberry basil boozy lemonade his burger was small and the presentation was unappetizing he said there was very little apple compote which would have made it better and when i tried it i thought the meat was bland my salad was bleh and had tough chicken i didnt like the fried pickles as much as others i have had but the loaded fries were really good and we both liked our drinks i was hoping this place was going to be better than it was because the atmosphere is funif youre in it for the scene it doesnt get better than the french press in sb if youre in it for the coffee go somewhere else  i really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and i love supporting local businesses but their drip coffee is overroasted and way too bitter hot iced it doesnt matter its all super bitter i wanted to like it so bad that i had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16oz cup of coffee handchosen based on my desired flavor profile it took 1015 minutes to make and cost me 6 it was terrible so effing bitter  to be clear im specifically talking about their coffee in this review their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious but ive never tried them thats not really my jam so if youre like me and just want a regular coffee go somewhere else handlebar sb roasting cothis taco joint is highly rated on yelp so i gave it a try last night for the first time i was a bit disappointed in my selections maybe some of the other menu options were better but i wasnt thrilled with what i chose when you come in you place an order and pay then they bring the food to the table for you it isnt a full wait service something inbetween since you do help yourself to beverages and condiments etc there have a wide selection of bottled beers as well as margaritas and mixed drinks i had read a review stating the margs were 3 but they were 595 last night and i didnt see any advertisement for happy hour or anything for the weekdayswhich was a disappointment  all the tacos are soft shell only which i guess is more authentic but not what i prefer i did the daily special which was a chicken verde and also did a beanvegetarian taco the chicken taco was overcooked and dry and the tortilla was wet and soggy from the verde sauce which i did not like the ingredients seemed fresh but overall it was just not working for me the bean taco was much better but still left something to be wanted  i will say the the chipsguacqueso we ordered was awesome so thats a 5 star in my book but not enought to make me want to go back for food if they had a happy hour i think it would be a fun place to hangout with friends for a drink and some chipstandoor is good the buffet is definitely worth 12 bucks theres chai and desserts as well as a salad bar i got 2 plates worth of food and was very satisfied seems like more of a take out or family style place but its always quiet when i go the service is alright but since i get the buffet it doesnt really matter the waiter still came by the table very often this will always be my go to for indian food in philadelphiathey have a wide variety of bubble teas  smoothies but i noticed they use powder flavorings i wish they used fresh fruits and real red bean  ive never tried their frozen yogurt although a glance at the toppings appear standard as that of a froyo type shop  i stepped in at 830pm on a summer evening and there was no one at the counter to take my order a lady finally walked out of the back room after 7 minutes or so  overall it wasnt the greatest but i cant say its the worst if you intent is to go for the bubble teas though keep driving about 6 miles east toward taiwanese tea house in castletonmy 3star rating is really not based on anything i just wanted to post a heads up  i went there today to buy some chocolate for a gift and they were closed with no hours or anything posted in the window i checked their website and it says they are currently only open every for private parties and events   bummer because id heard great things and really wanted to check it outthis location has struggled to find the right fit for a neighborhood restaurant on the surface jp tavern could be the fit however management should focus on a few common issues ive experienced after visiting a few times install sound panels to lower the deafening noise that echos throughout the interior create some type of separation between the bar area and dining area the kitchen is not getting the food out in a timely manner at all scallop ap came out fast and hot but steak sandwich and pizza took a while and was luke warmfries not hot and please dont charge me 10 for half a martini please pour a real drink if you have to charge more than do so we want you to succeed if possible find a top bartender in this town and steal himher away to work at jp tavernmy first time to let them eat cakei myself love cakes anyway its wasnt busy at all the service i have ever experienced granted it was friendly service after we ordered it was a few minutes before our everything arrived which was cool i went from hungry to moving past the pangs of wanting to eati must say my cake was good though the cake we had were ordinary to be honest i  have had better period with a much shorter waitbut its not that bad for me to stay away completeyi am a coffee addict so anytime i see a new place open i am there i just checked out the new old world coffee spot an california  the good french press chemex show me these folks know their stuff                 nice clean inviting space                  the music choices created a nice ambiance  the bad 12 ounces for 250 and the cup was not filled more than 75 also if i am paying for a french press i expect to wait a few minutes for my an actual french pressed cup of coffee i was instantly handed the coffee so it must have been premade  not one smile or acknowledgement of me as a customer no eye contact those are the things that for me make a coffee spot being made to feel welcome coffeebar makes me feel appreciated  i wish old world much luck and prosperity its a new spot and the kinks need to be worked out  i hope both they and bibo across the street survive i will return and hope for a better experience but still am very appreciate of the brave business folks who do the hard work in this difficult economic climatei am seriously going to ban myself from eating boiled crab from here on out its just so bland but not as bad as eating snow crab claws at seafood buffets that literally makes me sick  23 for the 3 pound crab special that came with clam chowder and a caesar salad it was the tiniest 15 crabs ever the first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means i pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws barely any meat in the body second crab was the same thing just cut in half but whatever meat i did have it was fresh ill give that to them  kind of disappointed after this so i went home and fried up my own 3 marinated crabs at 399 per pound totally made up for itfood is what youd expect at any innout what i really hate about this particular location is that the drive thru takes absolutely forever it could be due to the fact that this is the only one that i know of in the santa barbara area but stillenjoyed the shrimp poboys we tried each kind and thought they were both good the highlight was the lemon ice box pie so made up for the somewhat slow servicei drove out of my way to go to subway but then i saw gyros and kebab nextdoor and had to try it  the gyro was delicious and it was very cheap  i didnt quite feel comfortable in the restaurant but i was happy with my meal one of the guys working there wouldnt look at me it might be a cultural thing with how men are supposed to be towards women but im not even going to touch that topic  anyway i might come back if i happen to pass by it and im hungry and have time  lots of ifs thoughwe went with a group of locals to sample the custard after seeing reviews of this palce on tv  i am a huge frozen dessert fanice cream yogurt custardbut it was not as good as i had hoped  boo  very sad to report this  i had the big apple as my friend recommended  my husband had the brownie concrete and my two year old had a blueberry concrete  a few things did not helpwe had to walk to the back of the parking lot to find a benchand it was hot and humid  the treats were melting rapidly  i have never had ice cream custard or yogurt melt so rapidly  kind of disappointing  the flavor of the big apple was amazing  the others were average  maybe we will give it another shot on our next visitthe long and short of this place is that the food deserves four stars but the service at most two   their soups and sandwiches are excellent although most are at least as french or californian as they are viennese  i lived in vienna for a couple of years and know what you find there  the hungarian goulash is quite good being authentically viennese as opposed to hungarian in style  i recommend it for chili lovers as a nice variation on the theme that most will like   im diabetic and avoid sweets but the couple of bakery items that ive tried have been excellent  my husband has actually raved about the pastries  unfortunately if you eat here instead of taking food out the service is slow forgetful and apathetic at best  ive had the wrong items brought soup brought lukewarm presumably because it had been served up and then was left sitting to await the rest of the meal and lengthy waits for the check  this isnt some cultural difference between american expectations and viennese norms the viennese wouldnt find this level of service any more acceptable than i did  my recommendation  if you want to buy stuff to take home this is a good place  if you want to eat here better bring lots of patience and a good book or good company because you will need itdelicious strong coffee gorgeous italian ceramic mugs great big windows  and changing artwork on the walls   the croissants are incredible right off of rittenhouse square so if you cant get a seat or a table you can take your coffee outside all and all one of the better coffeehouses in the city cheaper and immeasurably better than starbucks  the only downside is the staff the baristas can carry a bit of an attitude at timesi first visited the barnes jewish cafeteria while waiting for a family member whom was having surgery i stopped in just before the lunch rush to discover a wide variety of lunch options ranging from several selections of hot dishes sandwiches salads and more i ended up going with a chicken parmesan entree which was priced at about 8 for a reasonable portion seating is plentiful however it does get crowded during lunch so be advised after the lunch rush you might find others using the cafeteria to work while waiting on people at the hospital in fact i even used it to catch up on some work while waiting   overall the experience was better than i had expected from a hospital cafeteria decent food reasonable options and a fair price makes this a decent option while visiting the hospitalcame here this morning for the first time  good donuts not the best in the city also way over priced i almost had a heart attack when she said 30 dollars for the dozen i cant speak for the chicken thoughi am not pleased with this rouses the staff could be a little more helpful produce could be better good price on coca cola todaynice and clean friendly staff but food just wasnt all that good id give them another chance thoughi gave the local taco a try for the first time today  its cute and has a nice patio and i really wanted to like it  i went during the late afternoon so there were only a few other customers in the place when we walked in  i was warned ahead of time by the person i dined with that its a little bit expensive and it takes him a full order of chips  salsa  3 tacos to fill up  i am not opposed to spending the money but i was really disappointed with my food  i will say this i did enjoy the tomatillo verde salsa very much  when i ordered my 2 tacos i was offered a lunch combo that comes with a side  the refried beans that i got were pretty dry and seemed like they had maybe been sitting out a while  it was late afternoon so it wouldnt be surprising  i got the southern fried chicken taco and the smoked brisket taco  the chicken came with almost no toppings so i covered it in the salsa  the brisket taco just had a flavor that i didnt care for  its a personal preference so others may think its fantastic  it just wasnt for me    the person i was with got the tequila lime chicken tacos  it seemed to be the closest thing to a traditional taco they offered and its probably what i should have gotten as well  after my late lunch i realized that i was expecting more options along the lines of traditional tacos when in fact this place offers just the oppositefood is fantastic service is quite awful  call ahead if you can so you dont have to wait  it took us 10 minutes to have our server acknowledge us once we waited 35 minutes for a table  it took another 1015 to get coffee and were never given cream we were given a pitcher of water but had to ask for glasses so we could drink it  they are understaffed and we visited on a saturday morning when they were having a special event so they should have known better food was amazing and my fianc loved his coffee  we definitely got better service at the warrington location so if youre thinking about trying this place out i would say go to the warrington one  they also have a better waiting area and full counter service area to get coffee while you are waitingive long admired the hotel mazarin for its picturesque courtyard because im often in the adjoining wine bar the exquisite patricks bar vin ive spend many an idyllic afternoonevening here ive also booked several of my colleagues at the mazarin when theyve come to new orleans and heard good things from them as recently as january 2015  so when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people i was leading hotel mazarin was at the top of my list and when you realize that in other local hotels youre probably going to get that new orleans jenk known as charm  for a similar price i will absolutely recommend hotel mazarin for being immaculate with one tiny exception in my bathroom but im insane amenities almost westinquality beds flatscreen tvs and the restrained modern baroque decor gold fixtures marble floors if youre a breakfastlover you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast eggs  bacon pastry toast cereal juices seriously ive stayed in new orleans hotels with tvs straight out of the 90s ancient as in not antique beds dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness i wont name names search my reviews if you must but hotel mazarin boasts higher standards   that said my colleagues and i had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted   multiple reports of the front deskreception staff being aloof and often downright surly unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of new orleans im honestly scratching my head over this one one of my people was reprimanded for putting a room cardkey in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys werent working she never put it in her wallet but even if she had when she explained that she had done no such thing the response from the desk was an eye roll another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy with a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him he thought he could request a quieter room he was informed that he was in a quiet room thats it no apologies or explanations i can write more but in the interest of space i leave it at these two instances   however all of the other hotel staff were great from management to catering special props to the lovely mary who took care of our conference room she is a gem everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were all so lovely and friendly everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone making sure they were having a great stay   the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didnt have anything hotter than lukewarm water this is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in new orleans i live here and i know the citys water pressure leaves a lot to be desired especially in old french quarter buildings but this isnt ok in a hotel apparently there was some trick to get it to work and i cant even tell you what that is because its really that tricky there should be instructions posted unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues rooms   catering although the food is good its extremely overpriced for what you get you are not allowed to bring in outside food so if youre using their conference room youre going to have to use these services i know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms so although i wont fault them for this next year ill try and find an alternative  related to this when setting up my catering order i specified that three of my group had dietary restrictionsextreme food allergies for the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches i thought theyd at least offer a gf bread option for one or two of them for my gf colleague but no second i was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not suddenly i saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and i later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency benadryl if he hadnt he likely would have needed to go to the hospital for his nut allergy is that extreme if i put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake pretty simple attention to detail is crucial again when youre paying extremely high prices for catering high expectations should be met  i would still recommend hotel mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city as well as the nice perks including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st amendment bar plus its just nicer all around than other fq hotels in this price rangemaybe my expectations were too high with chef joe baldino being just named a semifinalist for a james beard award  best chef midatlantic as others have stated the place is small fine but its loud and thats coming from someone from an irish family of loud talkers  based on other reviews i tried the tagliatelli al limone which was overwhelmed by the lemon it approached lemon pledge territory my friend had the gnocchi which i tried and were amazing this gave me food envy   while offering desert the server knocked our bottle of red wine down my sleeve spilling 13 of it fine it will come out of my black sweater but it was a goooood bottle of wine i expected the server to say let me bring coffee or a desert as an apology but we got nada  unfortunately a disappointing experiencethis is the 3rd time ive been here and they are out of plain bagels  how can you be out of plain bagels and its not even 1030 amthis place is like a fancy subway  the staff was very friendly and attentive  the clam chowder was a 3 out of 5  i also had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich  it was a 2  very bland and i think the tomatoes were old  i did like the chocolate strawberry  it was a nice surpriseive always liked this on the border its like chi chis on don pablos with one major difference  the food is really delicious  its like every other mexican chain restaurant in terms of menu choices decor and presentation but something about the way everything tastes just makes them a cut above the rest    weve also always had really great service every time so kudos to whoever does the hiring in there  now on to the reason theyre only getting 3 stars up until recently they gave you the option to build your own burrito  every table was equipped with a pad of paper with all types of burrito choices on it for you to fill out however you want and you would then hand it to your waiter and be presented with your perfect burrito shortly thereafter no ifs ands or buts  in my opinion probably the best thing they had going for them was this build your own burrito note pad  boyfriend and i went there monday night and were devastated to learn that in addition to the menu changes mentioned by the previous yelper the build your own burrito option is now no more    bad move otb  bad move  i got enchiladas instead and they were delicious  but something about filling out check boxes and having full control over whats being put on my plate will be very sorely missedhere is our back story  do you have a little time to kill  good because its gonna be fascinating  im gonna wow you with amazing tales of chili dogs and burgers  no waitdont go  itll be great  ok well for those of you who stayedheres my back story  we were in the gsr for a pentatonix concert  we had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the gsr is really bad  so this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line  luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into johnny rockets  we asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker  we ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter a classic burger for my wife and i ordered up the houston i upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra  the burgers coming out looked really good mine wasnt as good looking and was just fine tasting  nothing to write home about or get excited about just a standard fare sort of burger  my daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries  she enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu   our waitress daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly  so if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price  the prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint maybe even a little lower  parking isnt really that close because its inside the mall downstairs at the gsr but it is 1000000 times better than its old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long    wondering how busy they will be when summer comes and the beach is open  we will seei have been here twice and both times i left feeling underwhelmed i love pastrami burgers and the apollo burger is just that a burger with pastrami on top of it the burger was tasty and fresh but the pastrami was full of stringy fat i understand pastrami is fatty and i think it is an issue because if the thickness they cut the pastrami it needs to be much thinner or they have to use a better cut overall their food is decent but if i was in the area looking for a good burger i would go to sax deli or jumbo and delicious hopefully they can fix the issue with the pastrami because this is their signature dishit was decent food but im probably not going to go there again i just ate it and can already tell that my stomach is going to receive the repercussions for it haha the staff was very nice and gave me no problemsthis is more of a fast food hot chicken ready in 10 or 15 min so there are some cooking shortcuts that make for a less succulent chicken also the bird is normal size   a lot smaller than the giant ones at other hot chicken joints  so you may be disappointed in the size of the portion it was 8 for a leg quarter a side and a fountain drink  i got medium heat which is perhaps a little hotter than hatties the seasoning was quite good it wasnt an iwanttoeatmyselftodeath experience like youll get at hatties or princes but it was decent  go if in the area because youll get a decent meal for about what youd pay at any fast food joint  ill be backtwo star food and four star service  went here for lunch today with the boss and a coworker  tried the bbq nachos as the free checkin appetizer  they were tasty  loaded with goodies and the bbq was good kind of sweet which i like  after telling my companions that anyone who orders a veggie burger at a bbq place should be taken out back and shot i brilliantly ordered the soup and salad special  caught some flack for that one but the chili was made with burnt ends which i theoretically love and i wasnt superhungry after the nachos  did not like the chili at all  the burnt ends were just cubes of brisket and the pieces were too big to manage in a chili  the caesar salad was good but the lettuce was a little on the limp side  boss had the ribs glad i didnt order them because i could tell by watching him eat them that i would not have liked them  i like tender juicy meat that falls off the bone into my mouth and just melts  these looked a little dry for my taste and he struggled to eat them with a knife and fork  we agreed that the best part of the meal was the little piece of cinnamon bread pudding that came on the side of their lunch specials    service was spot on but we will probably stick to sugar fire or pappys for bbqlots of options here for lunch but there were some good takehome afterwork stores too in this upscale food court  of course youve got some good sweets to take home with termini bros and theres di bruno bros for everything else i also saw a produce stand with your basics and quite a few asian ingredients  under the c was a seafood market clever play on words that sold premade food as well as fresh seafood   see pics above of the shrimp offerings  we sampled their shrimp toast layered in cheese the shrimp nuggets were goodthey nearly sold out while we were waiting shrimp dumplings  coconut shrimp    because it was the end of the day we got 50 the prepared foodthe seafood looked freshthey had a good deal on skate wing when i was there but i cant say if the fish was overpricedpancakes are great with lots of options i would recommend not going during popular meal times the line gets crazyi enjoyed my meal at the burger joint i got the burger they named after themselves because i figured it would be their best burger i should have just built my own burger though it was a pretty average burger in every way if i could go back in time i would have got onion rings on my burger because while i was sitting there they served another customer onions rings in their burger and it looked awesome  the french fries need work i grew up on chip truck french fries so i always wonder why real restaurants cant cook a fry as good as the old man in the double decker bus in my home town i dont know their fry preparation techniques but it seems like they are only frying them once because they are cooked but there is no crunch just kind of soft all over i doubt i would go back because i am having too much fun following bacon hounds burger odysseythis cafe is a nice spot to chill and do some work in  they have good wifi and a good variety of seating options to accommodate you and any friends that might be with you  there are various dark wood tables inside and other tables outside  the coffee i had was only okay so although id certainly try it again maybe the barista was having an off moment i may also instead try one of their other beverages   there are tastylooking pastries and sandwiches available which i didnt tryit was definitely not the best fried chicken ive had the skin was not crispy enough and the meat was a little too dull not juicy enoughthis restaurant has a lot of potential but it feels like its having an identity crisis  the menu is a mix of italian spanish and american dishes  they seem to do everything well though but i wouldnt go here thinking that you can stick with one type of cuisine  the cod fritters were great  nice and crispy on the outside with a bit of creaminess in the middle  but the presentation was weird  they served it on a bed of french fries  if the cod fritters had been presented on a small plate sans french fries it would have dressed it up a bit  the bolognese and lasagna were both solid  not over the top but like good home cooking  the portion sizes were very generous for both  they have an excellent beer selection  tons of belgian beers and plenty of domestic craft beer  i love belgian beers but the beer list doesnt match the food  i would definitely eat here again but it would be nice if the restaurant would pick a personality and stick with itgreat food potential and perhaps execution for some customers unfortunately not us  tonight it was a very busy friday night we arrived at about 540 did not get the burgers before 640 and were still waiting for the check at 715 the second order of beer took at least 30 minutes the place is loud interesting ambiance kind of eclectic bday parties  families not a romantic place a place  you dont want to hang out in for more than an hour or you will leave smelling like fried oil  wish the time was the only consideration in the 3 star rating the service was slow and inattentive since all three  the burgers and the fires came out lukewarm to almost cold we ordered medium cooked burgers and the bison was well done hard and lacked any of the described toppings except for a few mushrooms so it was texture and lack of flavor the aged burger was good it was not quite juicy since it was not served warm but it tasted  good enough for a lukewarm burger i guess my husband liked it a lot more than me the fries are fine and the best part were the pickles   the beer list is packed with local beer options for half and full pours which is kind of fun since one could try a few different beers at very affordable prices the wine is considerably pricier and the list very limited almost discouraging  i tried the red blend and it was underwhelming to say the least  too thin and too sweet  we noticed other tables were served food before us even though we were seated a good 1520 minutes before them   after speaking with management we ended up paying only for the beer the management staff was very understanding and willing to help the stars go for the food concept potential and the way management respondedi had very mixed feelings about baileys range  i felt like this restaurant did many things right and a couple of things wrong   ill start out with the good  the atmosphere and service were fantastic  the person who took my order was friendly and helpful  the restaurant is spacious and clean  she suggested the rooster sauce for my fries and i had no complaints about the fries or sauce  unfortunately my burger experience was not so great  keep in mind the fact that i was hung over and hadnt eaten since the previous night so a big mac would have been delicious to me  i ordered the 12 ground lamb burger and was highly anticipating its lamby goodness  when the burger arrived it came with a homemade pickle good and homemade ketchup fantastic  now when i order a burger at an upscale ish burger restaurant i dont expect the burger to be large   however i do expect an appropriate bun size that doesnt totally overpower the rest of the sandwich  in this case the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the notsowellendowed burger patty  i ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better  all that said the sides shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger but barely  i would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic  unfortunately it wasnt and considering burgers are the main draw here the best rating i can give is an unenthusiastic 3 starsim a regular here the nuggets are kind of dry but the bacon mcdouble is on point the only bad side of this place is that the lines are long and slow  usually with only one register open but there is an employee that is a ray of light shes helpful friendly and always treats you special this little gem is known as connie so next time you see her tell her hi lets make her feel as special as she treats all of ustypical mcdonalds  open late  and thats a win when you need a burger at 1 amthis hard rock looks almost identical to the property in ft lauderdale except for the clubs shops and restaurants that are attached to it i must say that this casino has its pros and cons   pros plenty of nearby parking a variety of card games and tables a huge slot machine floor easy to find and close to ybor city   cons valet parking was disorganized the card game tables had high minimums and the dealers were not that friendly   i saw so many more different tables at this hard rock that ive only seen in vegas or atlantic city ie bonus texas holdem and all the asian games that i cant even spell or pronounce however on the threecard table there was a 20 minimum so to basically play one decent hand was a an investment of 4550 dollars needless to say i lost money fast but after a change in tables i quickly recovered   here they also have the onehand rule where you can only hold the cards with one hand which is just about the most ridiculous rule ive ever heard they also were not lenient with sharing card information with other players unlike other casinos because it doesnt matteryoure playing against the house   one of the hotel bars had a jumping 1980s crowd dancing like sardines in the small space while another bar had some live music with less than 10 people listening there are dining options here but we only came to play there was something for everyone at this casino especially watching tampas interesting charactersgood food healthy a tad expensive but worth it in quality of ingredients freshness and taste being a newer place the staff is still learning and overwhelmed forgot our juice in our kids meal gave us a chic breast instead of the burger we ordered in kids meal fixed mistake quickly will grow into a four star place for sureit was a gorgeous day so my friend and i decided to meet at local taco for lunch since they have such a great patio  the patio is the best thing about this place in my opinion    first of all it bugs me that i have to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant  i realize that is common at a taco shop but it still bugs me  secondly i asked our server for hot sauce when she delivered our food but even though they were not very busy i ended up having to go inside and get it myself because she forgot    other than that the food was ok not great but ok  i had a fish taco chicken taco and street corn  the tacos were good but the corn was cold    ill probably go back for the patio but its not my first choicein nola for mardi gras  the wait was 45mins customer service was really good everyone is super nice kudos to the staff  you guys rock the food it was average nothing special my french toast was crunchy not nice and fluffy like i like the french toast was lacking brown sugar cinnamon and nutmeg it came with fruit which was nice  the turkey bacon wasnt crispy enough  overall c prob wont be backnot the best nor the worse taiwanese food they do have a large menu to choose from the spicy braised beef noodle soup was ok  mildly spicy with hard not tender beef the broccoli beef reminds me of panda express pe but a notch better the chow mien was clean and tasty and not burnt like pe the almond milk was excellent very tasty like quickly  overall 3starsi certainly had higher expectations for this place maybe its due to the fact that im not a burger kind of gal but impress me it did not a group of ten recently had lunch here for my nieces birthday and i think about 25 of our party enjoyed their meal while the other 75 shared my way of thinking   we were seated right away which is a definite plus for having such a large group however they sat us at this super long table in the center of the space where it was impossible to hold a conversation with anyone other than the person directly across from you or next to you whatever i had a headache and didnt feel like being too social anyway the waitress came around to take our drink order and most people at the table ordered a shake im on a current health kick so i had ice tea instead when the shakes arrived i didnt feel like i was missing out on anything though the small size was just that super tiny like two dixie cups worth in a glass tiny definitely not worth the 350 price tag   on to the food everything here is served a la carte most of the specialty burgers come at a set price but if you order the basic and add anything to it we found that you could be up another 4 or more just by switching your bun and adding a slice of cheese and bacon you want a side of fries or onion rings thatll be a few more dollars oh you expect silverware how much is it worth to you ok they dont really charge for silverware but you get where im going with this i hate being nickeled and dimed for every little thing everyone in our group ordered something different and though i dont recall what each person got i only heard the verdict from everyone as we were walking out note the 25  75 above i had the veggie burger and quinoa side salad the veggie burger was decent it was a sweet potato patty topped with pecan butter and spinach the quinoa salad was not my favorite and i was actually proud of myself for finishing at least half of it its served cold and mixed with dried cherries onions and balsamic vinaigrette the onions were overbearing though thats the only flavor that came through  at least the birthday girl enjoyed her shake but as for me i dont expect that baileys will get another nickel or dime from my wallet anytime in the near futureafter hearing friends talk about this little specialty gourmet shop i went since its across the street from me i ordered a few hoagies and sandwiches and then some pastassauce the hoagies were good and the service is greatnice salad at a good price but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands as service is slow and disorganizedlots of slots you have to pay to park the cocktail waitresses arent cute drinks take forever and everyone smokes in there id still go back thougheaten here a few times and came strictly for drinks yesterday baileys and all their restaurants are great and so is the range 35 stars would be a truthful number mainly i round down because of their service my reasoning for the almighty stars would be as follows   4  amazing food quality ingredients with chefs who know how to experiment with flavors that go together better than you and your girlfriend boyfriend i have not heard anyone saying they do not like their burgers they are small errrr gourmet in portion but big in flavor sauces are hit and miss french fries are good to great and everything ive eaten or tried off another plate was a big hit except for the patty melt which is a bust my stove does better than theirs for this regard   35  price point again is the achilles heel for all baileys places to me i am from chicago when i want to pay chicago prices i usually end up going to all the best places in chicago st louis has been rated one of the most cost effective cities to live in recently  not because of the range chocolate bar rooster etc   3  the service is average at best the staff is friendly not rude slow and i find it hard to remember a time when they have gone out of their way it is as if they are not working for tips   sure the baileys restaurants are sleek sexy cool and important to the city evolvingi love that but please hire some people who are also sleek sexy cool and important to the city evolvingthis place has great atmosphere but the menu is dumb its just a few phoofy pretzel sandwiches that dont really go along with drinking at a bar its like they have an identity crisis its not really a german style restaurant but theyre charging high prices for a limited german style menu they just need to get some damn wings burgers nachos and regular bar food in there and would it kill them to get at least one belgian beer in there every bar in nashville has nothing frickin ipas lame also theyre not open on sundays so you cant go there to watch the game so why the tv screens then so we can watch dancing with the stars its just doesnt make sense are you an actual village pub or just a fake north korean store frontwas waiting for a table at 3 sisters cafe decided to walk down for some coffee to make the time go faster monon coffee was close and decided to check it out the neighborhood broad ripple is pretty cool monon is in a semirenovated location near the heart of the district  the look is classic coffee shopish a bit of peeling paint etc there was a large selection of coffees to choose from and a large selection of backed good to choose from   i just grabbed a quick latte the service was fast and friendly and the coffee was good as well all in all a good experience   njoydecor and theme of the restaurant is great we had the nachos appetizer  it was really good pulled pork wasnt the best ive ever had sides were really good kind of on the pricey side for bbqi cannot find any restaurants that serves better raviolis i get them everytime i go for the most part unless something catches my eye on the weekly special menu which is always booming with kick ass options service is okay but never he best but good atmosphere and drinks tip stay away from window seats during cold seasons its cold and very uncomfortable when trying to enjoy your mealtortugas really surprised me i think i didnt like the name or location but a friend recommended it and i tried it first for take out the food was delicious the serve a nice complimentary pico de gallo with house made tortilla chips its not easy to find a chile relleno around here and they make a good one the enchiladas with pork are delicious and the creamy chipotle chicken has become a family favorite we havent tried their drinks yet but they were offering a white peach sangria the other day that sounded greati was very disappointed in our lunch this afternoon food quality was a 3 price point should be 25 prices were ridiculously high for a deli the best part of the meal was the egg salad delicious the supreme sub was a disappointment the worst part of the meal was the service once the waitress delivered the food she never returned to refill drinks or see if we needed anything else i will not be going back to this establishmentreally the only option for boba in pinellas park would not recommend the shaved ice as it is not smooth and fluffyaquafinz is a great value spot if you are looking for decent seafood  the portions are big  we had the ahi tuna fish n chips and macadamia encrusted magic magic  the all were tasty  service was a little slow but not bad  the wait staff was friendly and attentive  well be backsomehow feels a little sad compared to all the other grocery stores in the area the first thing you see upon entry is a small antishoplifting turnstile shoved in the corner that you have to walk though to get in last time i checked brentwood isnt exactly a hotbed of grocery theft target and trader joes are one block over and things are always cheerful and unturnstiled over there  its also quite dark inside and there doesnt appear to be much turnover in the salad bar and hot deli section  however they did carry kimchi that is a definite win over schnuckswhile i will admit that this is not my favorite rouses they do have certain things that i like the best thing they have is the prices on their merchandise they are cheaper than windixie down the street but they lack the selection of their competitor  if you want to go to a better location check out the rouses on airline hwy in metarie the problem i have with this particular rouses is that it has more of a closed in feeling to it it just doesnt seem the same as all the other rouses i go to  in short its alright to check this one out if you live in the mid city area but still not my favorite rouses locationsurprise to see so many 5 stars  i went in with high expectations and was sadly disappointed  i gave this place two visits just in case the first time was just an off day  allow me to explain  heading out for work i had a craving for donuts i typically do not eat sweets so early but chocolate glazed sounded good read good reviews and had to see for myself well place is nothing  spectacular   i was expecting full racks shelves and trays stacked with goodies and glass display cabinets filled with cakes of all sorts what i saw instead were half empty racks table of cookies had few selections and atmosphere did not have the great aroma of a fresh bakery and to top it off my cashier very young lady was not that friendly did not even make eye contact as she accepted my payment  like i said maybe just an off day  so i return another day and this time it was in the afternoon did not see another customer so i figured quick service well three employees were there talking fairly loud one acknowledged my presence and gave me a greeting she had to get through two other employees deep in their loud conversation the lady taking my order had to asked me twice what i said  she would apologize for not hearing me the first time as she also apologized for the loud noise coming from the other two  i got my order and went on my way  the donuts are ok  i could buy from grocery store and be just as satisfied i would visit again just to try other items i do support local family businesses so give this place a tryim a texas girl and crave kolaches every time im not home the problem is you cant seem to find them anywhere outside of the lone star state imagine my excitement when on my way home from a fasting blood test i saw a sign for kolaches i nearly killed myself slamming on the breaks to turn in for one  i ordered it and a king cake doughnut for my son as it was mardi gras season went to my car and did the most safe mama thing ever i ate while driving hey my stomach was digesting itself dont judge   after all of my excitement and anticipation i hadnt been back home in months i was left horrifyingly dissapointed this thing was nothing but a hot dog wrapped in what tasted like the breadsticks you bake from a can with a piece of suprisingly unmelted american cheese slice my son liked it because its basically a large pig in a blankethot dog love child not like the kolaches i inhale back home the bread was just wrong and the hot dog component was jarring it was billed as sausage technically you arent wrong but when i say sausage i dont mean hot dog please kolache recipe creator go to donalds doughnuts on 146old bayport rd in seabrook tx its only a 6 hour drive and have a few kolaches my favorites are the sausage jalapeo and cheese the croissant wrapped one is exceptional the traditional one is amazing as well ham and cheese jalapeo boudain kolache also wrapped in a croussant and bbq pulled pork kolache omg amazing youll thank me and kolache business will improve exponentially if you use some of their ideas and then proper dough they also spirt an amazing sausage egg and cheese croissant sandwich and amazing breakfast tacos another thing i can very unfortunately rarely find done correctly outside of texas if thats too long of a journey find the closest shipleys to the state line donalds is better but shipleys is good too i have to say after the kolache experience  i cringe every time i see it flash on your sign when i drive by  what saved this review from one star status was that king cake doughnut im not a sweets person but snuck a bite from my son that was a pretty spectacular doughnut my son agreed by the rate he inhaled it without speakingi used to love randalls  i will never go back  they are now charging 100 for weller antique  you can buy this on wine searcher for 40  it retails for around 20  theyre also charging 47 for eagle rare which isnt very rare and 50 for a 20 bottle of sazerac  999 for a bottle of old rip van winkle 10 year  have you lost your minds   i like patronizing local stores and supporting small businesses but theyre rude and theyre ripping people off  enjoy you 400 markups and warm beer  ill be shopping at total wine and wine and cheese where they treat people with respect and charge 20 for weller 12 and 30 for eagle rare  amend a pleasant surprise  they are raffling 4 bottles van winkle 12 for 5999  kudos for listening to your customersservice fantastic food nothing special  cool little place ny themed  baseball game on the tv  waitress sophia was excellent  attentive pleasant fast didnt disappear  i got the blue cheese salad with house italian dressing it was soso  got some cheese fries which were good but how hard is it to make cheese friessteak and shrimp is greatly delicious big size and thick the sides are a pretty big size too thats why the prices arent marked on their dailychanged menus just for the 2 of us was 70 i went with a groupon though nice scenelove the conceptand apparently so does half the city long lines competing music and general chaos rule here bring cash and a crap load of patience and maybe you can find the few diamonds in the roughthis place is relatively smaller than other pho places in santa barbara the food in general is tasty although i think they probably include msg in it i love their beef sandwich and the chicken one too however their boba is slightly pricythe staff here is very friendly but i beg to differ when it comes to the line in this store i dont know what it is but the line is always long i havent waited for coffee so long at a store in philadelphia or nyc one of my chief complaints i understand customer service but catching up on life school kids is not a good when the lines are longi will start with the fact that ive only been there once last night and will probably go back at least once moreto be fair i like supporting the little guy  my husband and i had the pollo asado taco  which was all chipotle the barbacoa taco  which was so salty you couldnt taste anything else the carne asada taco  which had so much cheese on it you couldnt taste the meat and the carnitas bowl which was probably the best thing we had   the chips had way too much cumin on them cumin does not make food authentic latin cuisine the rice is definitely minute rice and the beans are canned and neither were seasoned however the tortillas themselves are pretty good and the guacamole and salsa were both very nice  i dont care much about atmosphere or the decorsince i am not eating either of those things the place looked cleanwhich is very important to me  prices were reasonable  for what it is  that being said it was a nice try and we will go back at least once moremaybe it was just a bad night the staff was friendly enough and we were comfortable there  if you want decent mexican food in st pete this is probably your best bet  unless you fancy the taco bus which struck out three times with me  however if you want authentic mexican food try miguels in tampa or casa tinas in dunedin its a drive but well worth itsuch a neat little barrestaurant with tons of potential could be a great local pub if the hours were more predictable they tend to close if theres not many people hanging out that can really dampen plans great for wine cocktails and stops along your bar crawl route if youre lucky enough to catch them on a good night they might have a local band playing during the summer or on warmer nights this can be a great stop along your bar crawl because you can chill outside and people watch media has some great people watching but even indoors the warm colors and cozy bar makes for an intimate experience the typical crowd is 30something    next door they have a restaurant ive never eaten here because the menu looks a bit inflated ive heard good things though maybe ill check it out next time i wander up the streetthis place is ok a tourist trap for sure but what a spectacular spot right on the pier  they have picnic tables set up outside perfect for enjoying sbs beautiful weather  the food however is meh  if you have a hankering for deep fried seafood this is your place  coming from the east coast we have some killer seafood shacks and  less is more when it comes to fresh seafood   we shared an order of the coconut shrimp which was second to the garlic clams that they were out of  the shrimp were fat and succulent but heavy with oil as well as the onion rings  it was served with a bright red dipping sauce that was watery and had he flavor of kooladenot good  after minutes of trying to figure out the artificial flavor that was so overpowering we came to the conclusion that it was the juice from the bottle of maraschino cherries   the side of coleslaw was ok very light on the mayo and sprinkled with pineapple and raisins refreshing against the heavily oiled shrimp i glanced over at the crab cakes that my friend had ordered and it looked quite dense and heavily breaded  this is not your maryland crab cake which in my opinion is the best  why cover up the sweet rock crab that is literally pulled out of the fresh water a stones throw away granted i did not have anythings else here but if you cant execute a simple fried plate of seafood it may set the stage for the rest of the menu it will curb your hunger while you take in the stunning oceani love love love the teriyaki burrito tonight it was all burrito and no teriyaki this is something special so when it is ordered someone ought to take great care to make it what ii is supposed to be maybe next timethere is always a huge line out the door and around the corner  im a local and ive been three times  i dont get the hype  its not bad but its no better than any other breakfast place  i have nothing negative to say but its just another breakfast placeordered the veggie pho for takeout the amount of veggies is nice and a lot more than you get with veggie pho from other places but the broth is very fishy smelling and tastingthis was another touristy must do spot to eat that was also packed and had a long line the setup of this place was a bit different you order your food first pay for your individual meal which i loved and then grab a table one of the servers informed us by the time we placed our order there would be tables for us and that was true i was shocked because of how crowded the place was i ordered the american special of eggs bacon grits and pancakes that was delicious i tasted one of my friends chocolate pancakes which was different but a bit too much chocolate for breakfast in my opinion  this place really deserves 4 stars but their unpreparedness for a large crowd during a popular festival weekend warrants a deduction they ran out of flatware and some of the juice and tea dispensers were empty i informed staff and they sincerely apologized and stated they would get to itthey definitely needed more staff the other thing i didnt like was that you waited in line in the middle of the restaurant and can be literally breathing on  other patrons eating their food well thats how it felt and it was just too tight and the set up wasnt comfortable at allpanda express is good fast food chinese food  nothing authentic or hiend cuisine  but it is decent chinese takeout that you can eatin if youd like  they have around a dozen or so dishes you can choose from with pricing generally based on 1 2 or 3 entree platesthe food was ok typical take out chinese food i would eat here again only because its super close to my house i got the chicken with garlic sauce it had a little spice to it and the sauce was very sweet the portion was a nice size i had plenty left over i also ordered a spring roll it was about the size of an egg roll not the best spring roll ive hadgreat milkshakes but slowwwwwwww service every time ive been in herecons this bar has a very very very limited food menu  but the kitchen somehow takes up 13 of the restaurant  not sure what that is about  the prices are extremely high in proportion to the food quality and portion size  a chicken sandwich that is a little bigger than a slider for 13 no fries  a side order of fries is 4 and about the same size as fries in a happy meal  17  tax and tip and unless youre 9 yrs old you will still be hungry   pros the staff seem very friendly  especially the redheaded bartender she is very pleasant and accommodating  they have a nice beer selection and you can buy a growler to go of your favorite beer  the wings are really good toothe staff was nice but not a great meal i had the ice coffee which was just okay i also ordered the crawfish touffe if this was the first time i had touffe i would have never ordered it again the crawfish didnt look or taste fresh the dish itself tasted more like a watery gumbo we also ordered a side of fried green tomatoes which were pretty good along with that we ordered the healthy breakfast which was a good dish there are way better food places than this one save your time and money and go somewhere elsei really wanted to love the food here but it just wasnt good the pizza was bland and my caesar salad was literally soaking in dressing i like a good amount of dressing but this was beyond normal   the set up inside is kind of awkward to order their menu is on a chalkboard hung high right above the order counter everyone piles in right there with their necks cranked up to look at the menu theres a cooler of drinks and a wall kind of blocking everyone in a small area they really need to print some paper menus and put a line rope up to steer people away from the door   the good points why i gave 3 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and seating outside they have a really nice set up of comfy chairs and tables with a overhang and large pretty tree for shade perfect place to sit for a beer or ice cream we will be back to try the ice cream sometime hoping the owner takes some suggestions from the more constructive reviews on here and changes things up a bit its so hard to find good food and good location around here always one or the otherin desire of gastropub fare but tired of our usual haunts a few friends and i ventured to pub and kitchen 19th and lombard i had been to the former restaurant chaucers once before and the transformation was drastic pub and kitchen has been able to achieve lighting nirvana in their small space creating a warmth that filters throughout service was quick and attentive without being overbearing but on to the food  i highly recommend trying the bar snacks which are a steal at 3 a pop we sampled the duck liver pate and fish mop rolls the latter were delicious if memory and taste serve me correctly it was some kind of white fish combined with a creme fraiche accompanied by potatoes and herbs on crusty bread all of which is underscored by a hint of citrus the flavors are sophisticated and complex two large pieces come to an order  entrees i was in the mood to go light so i ordered the onion soup 8 with a side of brussels sprouts 5 what made the onion soup distinct was the addition of some kind of wheat beer i think to the broth which stood up to the strength of the cheese and paired well with the sweet caramelized onions my only complaint some of the cheese on top of the soup burned at the edges under the broiler my side of brussels didnt achieve as high marks the brussels were overcooked as well as the accompanying bacon the flavors hit the mark blending well but the execution fell short  we had also ordered the fish and chips an altogether unspectacular dish especially considering the steep price tag 1618 dont remember exactly the chips lacked a certain crispness adding to the overall ineptitude also ordered was the steak and potatoes 22 not more perfectly could the steak be cooked rare au poivre and blissful not as much could be said of the potatoes done in a hash brownlatke style which seemed old and overdone  in all a pleasurable experience with exceptional flavor and ambiance however echoing other reviews the actual cooking has yet to find its groove potatoes and brussels especially at this price point should be done without error this has yet to happen  to sit at the bar with a drink and bar snack before venturing out for the eveningyes this would be delightful and really the most prudent of actions  ciao rwffirst time here  great smoothies well done too they have a great variety of smoothies i think this is a place id comeback and well make me a smoothie fanatic the persons working there were nice and cheerful  my only complain and deal breaker are floors were dirty with water standing on the room behind what seems to be a storage  door was open also the person preparing the smoothie washed his hands and dry them with his own tshirt  i will recommend review this issues and present the store more appealing to consumers by following public health guidelines  thanksthis johnny rockets location was on the bottom floor of the grand sierra hotel conveniently located next to the pool area my husband and i came here thinking that we could use his promo points to help pay for our meal here but alas take note that because johnny rockets is not owned by grand sierra the points do not work here i wish we couldve asked first rather than find out after our meal so minus 1 star for that  i ordered the big pastrami pretzel burger and my husband ordered the blt chicken avocado sandwich as our entrees with a cherry coke float and banana shake to go with it everything was amazing and delicious just as i expected johnny rockets to be i only docked another star because the service was slow even though it wasnt completely packed with peoplepretty good but i wasnt blown away especially not for the price p waitress was great thoughattentive and friendly  wildfire burger medium rare  i couldnt tell where the wildfire descriptor came from i couldnt taste any of the toppings did dig around looking for chipotle mayo and think i found it on the bottom bun the meat was good and soft but the burger as a whole tasted mostly plain  fries  crispy and hot so good i was able to split this with another person  red curry catsup  tasted like how i thought sriracha catsup should taste  regular catsup  i could have sworn this was the curry catsup because it definitely tasted like it had curry powder in it  pistachio shake  pretty good with lots of pistachios the flavor was intense  102314 my second visit here solidified my 3star impression although now its a pretty weak 3 stars the coconut crunch shake was good but my classic burger was dry and plaintasting i ordered it medium rare but it came out well done gah also did not get a side of regular ketchup with my burger this time the waitress was nice thoughi love wawa but this one is only okay the deli orders seem to be not as consistent as other wawas i also hate the parking lot if you come during lunch time its insanely busy its difficult to pull out of your parking spot as theres always another car right behind you waiting to pull in id rather drive over to the one in narberth employees have always been friendly thoughim such a sucker for cute locally owned breakfastlunch spots that have health conscience options so naturally i have ventured to emerald city quite a few times im really glad that its under new managment because last summer when i went there is was really disappointing the last few months our visits have been promising the wraps coffeee breakfast burrito scones and lemon curd are all very tasty nothing is ever over the top good but for coffee shop fare its nice the staff is always really friendly and the dining space is super comfortable and relaxingsanta barbara shellfish company is located at the end of the wharf the view is simply amazing we came here on a wednesday evening for early dinner id say its pretty packed for a weekday there was a 30 minutes wait for outside seating so we decided to take inside instead   was craving for some oysters so i tried their oyster shooters hmm definitely too sour for me it was really just okay i got their crab cake came with onion rings and salad my sister got their fried calamari shrimp scallops and oysters also came with onion rings and salad love their fried calamari and oysters   their foods are okay service is very attentive and friendly  but i think this place is overrated i would come back for the view and fried calamarii had a hard time with this one most of the options were a little pricey and not a huge variety to choose from i mean 17 for a burger i ended up getting the cajun catfish in a tomatoy sauce with rice on the side it was alright but lacked some flavoring several at our table got the shrimp poboy and looked like that wouldve been a much better optionthe pancake plates are definitely a good value under 10 for the peach and the banana bread pancakes however we did not feel that the pancakes were special or worth the wait the line wrapped around the restaurant even at noon on a wednesday i wish the pancakes were fluffier and that the banana ones had actual slices of bananas with the plate we thought the quality was on par with ihop the sausage links were clearly not made in house frozen service was friendly though and the price was right for a diner breakfastok so the pancakes were great sweet potato however the waitress was soo uninterested in us never asked to refill our coffee an had no personality maybe she had a bad day and was tired idk i am glad to have had the sweet potato pancake experience oh and dont forget your sweater as it was cold in herecute place and the dragon tea i got with sea salt foam was pretty good not too sweet and i was afraid the sea salt foam would be too salty but was just fine very thick foam and is a little too much but very tasty with crispy jelly added this place is on the higher end of prices imo for just a boba milk tea but the ambience is super aesthetic and cute only 4 stars because they didnt have half of their menu available lol but im excited to go back and try their uji matcha items when its in stock  update  still no matcha but tried their waffle puff cone this time around and its super tasty perfectly made cone thats super crispy on the outside and soft in the center not too sweet so the cone with the ice cream arent sickening like other places i also appreciate that the cone is cooled a little bit before the ice cream is placed in so its not all melts right away   sassy owner though not sure i wanna come back now the best the waitress i wish i had her name tall slender and woth long brown hair she was charming and helpful and prompt best part of my meal  the good the kei tuna was so so good i normally dont like tuna but wow that was so good i ordered quite a few the inside is super beautiful and the colors are vibrant and it had flavors that played well together   the bad bland was a reoccurring theme some of the rolls were ok but most where just absolutely flavorless mango tango or whatever was just foam mango had no flavor and i mean lemon n spice are flavors but you cant run a restraunt on 2 flavors   overall i want to give them another chance and i hope i will get some more flavor if not ill take a bunch of kei tunaswhen i walked in here i did so with every intention of reviewing it and in my mind i said ive been here a few times and im pretty certain a 2star is the best theyll ever get out of me  obviously this visit dissuaded me and gained themselves an extra star  that said while the employees are extremely almost overly friendly the store still lookscheap compared to borders or barnes and noble i feel like this is the equivalent of having a taco from taco bell rather than taco bus if you dont know what the means go yelp for taco bus   my point is this its goodokaysatisfiesthecraving but when it comes down to it there are other better places that are just around the cornerthis is a great place to study or read the paper but especially on weekends you have to get there by 9 or 10 am at the latest if you want to actually get a spot there are large tables to spread your things out on plenty of outlets and good wireless theyre also open until 10 which is very very late for a neighborhood coffee shop and much appreciated  its not a great place to have a casual conversation because most of its patrons seem to think its a public library and will shoot you dirty looks  the coffee and food are decentnot greatand reasonably priced and the staff is friendlythe decor is old and in desperate need of an update but the food is always consistent   the chicken tenders are the best in the business and what else needs to be said about the taters  just yummy  not good for you but omg are they delicious  the prices are a little higher than they need to be but its a nice changeindeed ive had better the only thing that keeps having me come back is their heart attack appetizer hooray for heart burn sarcasmservice friendly prompt courteous outstanding outdoor seating sunny and breezy  very comfortable  kitchenware nothing plastic all real stemware flatware and dishes yay  lends to tastier fare and friendlier to the environment   cold beer in a real glass bonus  downside the server recommended crabby bills hearty portions of grouper in the meals and sandwiches  i was hooked then later disappointed to find this meager fillet dwarfed by a mega bun  big expectation diminished value    flavor fair for both meals  grouper sandwich noted above philly chicken ok bun lightly seasoned smothered in cheesedowngrading here based on the service during our most recent visit i brought in a party of 6 this time i was looking forward to taking my parents and friends here after a fabulous visit last year the problem was not the food we ingested but the food that was cleared and spilled onto our laps and the floor my friends purse was almost slopped on my dads shorts were dripped on and i was constantly fearing for my face every time a server reached across to fill water or clear a plate ive never seen plates scraped off at the tablecome on really its a shame because the food is great but we will not be back well maybe if they start to offer dry cleaning with purchase of an entreeamazing food and drinks good coffee but theres flies everywhere i eat here pretty often and thats always a problemtheir food is ok they give you plenty so thats good also they have fair prices  and the atmosphere is good service is ok  very friendly people if youre in the neighbor hood stop by why not  nothing to lose  but also nothing to gain  keep in mind the iced coffee is really good i had the breakfast burrito which was bad it was wrapped in a mission tortilla and was tiny they used jarred tostito style salsa which ruined it get the coffee stay away from the microwaved foodgot the banana split chocolate glaze and mocha donut chocolate glaze was very rich and i dont like too rich so it wasnt for me but the banana split was delicious didnt really taste like a banana split more like a cream puff flavored with a lil banana but i liked it its about 2 per donuthad lunch here the other day  not bad but ive had better the makhani chicken was a little on the tough side  loved the chana masala saag paneer and the salad was crisp and fresh the naan was ok but they didnt have mango or tamarind chutney this was a major disappointment for me nevertheless the ghulab jamun kheer and chai tea were all okaycelebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015 broad ripple brewpub is known as indianas first brewpub  the brewpub looks like a typical english pub on the inside with dark wood paneling a tin ceiling and even a fireplace  plus it has a large patio that can seat up to seventy people during nice weather  broad ripple brewpub has a diverse menu and several of their own beers on tap to compliment nearly anything you choose  they offer various starters salads sandwiches burgers pasta and classic pub entrees such as fish and chips and bangers and mash  thankfully i scanned the entire menu as the very last item on it happened to be pizza    broad ripple brewpub has a few of their own pizza creations to choose from but i ordered a more basic sausage and pepperoni one  my pizza ended being much better than i expected for something listed last on their menu  the thin crust was cooked in a way that it allowed it to be somewhat firm but not charred and i liked that  it had a good amount of cheese without me ordering extra and i also liked the way it was cooked to a golden brown  the sauce and meats didnt stand out as much but there was nothing wrong with either of them  if everything listed on broad ripple brewpubs menu before the pizza is even better than it then i need to have many more meals there and i recommend others do the same  as a cheese lover i had to sample their cheese curds in addition to my pizza and will say that they were pretty tasty so i havent found anything i dont like on their menu yetplace is average wasnt to bad felt a little uncomfortable therei cant understand how this place has such rave reviews  maybe it is because i came in the middle of the day  maybe i have bad luck  maybe i checked into the wrong spoon me gps fail  anyway the place looked so drab and actually dirty the one girl who was working was nice but not so apologetic when she told me they were out of fruit and a few other things  there werent many flavors to choose from or toppings for that matter i must say though that the quality of froyo was better than that of the place in my town but the toppings were kind of sad   i will be back most likely since it is near my work expect to see better next timei know ted drewes is an icon and famous and everyone rants and raves about it but to be perfectly honest is it all that amazing  not really  i think its pretty average frozen custard with standard toppings  i do like some of their specialty treats like the big apple and the hawaiian  but  the main reason for this mediocre review is their false claims about their famous concretes  never do i have a worker actually flip my concrete upside downprobably because if they did it would all spill out  now i can grant them some reprieve if i order a concrete on a 90 degree night in july  i can see why the custard wouldnt be hard as a rock  however whats the excuse when i went in february and still got a half melted concrete  not worth the hypeits something to do when youre bored you get some beer at the end we went on what was apparently the second busiest day of the year day after thanksgiving and it was still orderly and informative not exciting enough to go againim not sure what all the fuss is about  went there last night and had the coconut smoothie and it was very good  then ordered the mapo tofu fried pork bao and the eggplant and pork what a disappointment  the tofu while a large enough portion had very little flavor  we ordered it with pork and it had maybe 5 little pieces of ground pork  we kept adding spices and soy to get some flavor  then while the eggplant had good flavor it was a bit undercooked and also wheres the pork  i have never seen less meat in a dish that advertised meat  never  the pork bao was ok but the bao part was a bit old and i had to pick the hard parts of the dough off   i would not return  thoroughly unimpressedowner tends to let the place get pretty warm inside before closing the front door and turning on the ac i cant imagine how the folks working there must feel  if ya pull up on a warm day and see the front door open well you know what to expectthis was our first time in zionsville we drove around and thought the area was super cute  this coffee shopbreakfast place has free wifi yay good strong coffee and some yummy cinnamon rolls you order at the counter and seat yourself at any open table  i got the veggie quiche is comes with fruit and the hubby got a breakfast burrito with chipotle cream cheese i liked that the quiche wasnt humongous and they had quite a few veggies the fresh fruit cup was also really good especially the pineapple overall a pretty cute place although this place has coffee and serves food they are pretty decent at both but not something unique i would drive all the way to zionsville for its more of a ifiamintheareaiwillstopin kind of a place i would give it 35 stars if i couldit is with great disappointment that i have recently discovered earls has removed their iceberg beers and they are no longer available for purchase my friends and i often spend multiple nights per week at this establishment eating dynamite rolls which are top notch and drinking keiths icebergs the iceberg is a staple in the prewhyte ave drinking scene and no doubt accounted for a large part of this particular business profit i am not a restaurant manager but to me it seems like a poor decision to remove such an item from the menu my vists here will be a lot less frequent indeed a 5 star rating would have been well deserved if icebergs were still on the drink menuconvenient but soo expensive and nothing is local except for some very awful pickles even in the summer time it would be nice to see more local small farm producesaturday night  3 of us 7pm and they are packed  took the last table by the front door and suggest you dont if its chilly  took a bit for a wait staff member to greet us but once they did things speed up  pork belly tacos a must  wow  flavor for days  lemongrass chicken verm and grilled shrimp bowls were amazing  we ordered egg rolls that never arrived so my assumption is they had staff call off and those that were there did the best they could  my 2nd visit will be during the daymy wife and i went last night for the first time because we are considering moving to seminole heights  before i write a full review i will say the food was great but the service subpar    the first thing we noticed as we walked in was a sign in sheet and there were only 4 names in front of us we figured it shouldnt take very long plus there are 2 tables open that just need to be cleared  about a half hour passed and we were still waiting and only one of the two tables had been cleared  finally after an hour of waiting we were seated  soon after being seated we were able to order and the service got better  as we were waiting we were never greeted or offered any kind of beverage which certainly would have raised my rating  a suggestion would be to have somebody host and at least give you some idea of how long you are going to be waiting  the noise level is very high because its such a large room and terrible acoustics so you have to talk at a high level  the decor in the place is awesome with old vespa like scooters hanging from the ceiling old bikes toys coke signs etc  the tables have toys and games on display under glass which is really cool    now for the food  great i loved the pizza  we also had breadsticks great and a greek salad that we loved  a small salad was big enough for two of us  we got the the cappy that was new york style and would certainly recommend  we will definitely be going back to try the chicago style but probably not on a friday night   its possible that it was an off night maybe someone called in sick  it looked like there were only 2 waitresses for the whole place and it was a friday night  overall mediocre experience great food and we will be going back to give another shotthumbs up for atmosphere ice cream quality kicking bloody mary creativity pickle concoction smell of baking buns and taste of freshbaked buns  thumbs to the side for extra chilly   thumbs down for cold oversalted fries homemade catsup fountain staff attitude sorority i hate my life  gourmet burger mission decidedly accomplished  recommendations turn up the heat warm up and strip down the fries offer heinz for the lowly unappreciative among us if youre going to charge separately for fries and burgers at least throw in my 2 tbsp of mayo for free come now   dave you did it again nice workthis was our second visit to pjs but the first happened nearly two years ago  i remember being underwhelmed back then and sad to say i still am  there is a full bar with 5 or 6 beers on tap which was nice but the bar itself could have used one more television  we were sitting on the opposite end and had to crane our necks  my husband had a reuben which he said was very good and i tried the fina sandwich which had potential  the fina was turkey and ham on a toasted roll with a nice honey mustard and onions  the flavors were great together but boy was it salty  almost too salty to eat  we also split an order of fries which were ok but got cold almost immediately  well probably give it another try during football season but this isnt a restaurant i would go out of my way to visitto see this beautiful building on the inside and to see it renovated was a real treat the food beer and their own corn whisky was great my only suggestions are to dim the ceiling lights a little too bright as for the noise i know that smooth surfaces are in but it causes too much echo and sound bouncing around its too loud due to all the flat surfacesthis acme is open 24 hours which is good for me they have a section for gluten free products  other products through out the store are labeled a such as well the beat time to go to avoid the long lines is definitely late night   their products are a bit higher than other markets i frequent for the convenience i will pay that for now i have encountered several expired products  have brought this to the managers attention in the past make sure the dates are checked on everything before you pay they are good with accepting returns but save that receipt   its a good place to pick up a few things but heavy duty shopping ill reserve for elsewhere  update wellkeep checking those dates i returned a month later expired organics vanilla soy milk exp august 132018 for salesuper happy to have a new breakfast option in stlouis not sure why this place was so hyped for so long not any better than any other place in town average at best this establishment is way too small which im sure will be corrected when the average food and high prices take effect now for the best part of the visit the egg was cooked perfectly 100 perfect everything else was just ok cant really tell if its out of the box or made from scratch other than the window into the kitchen i would definitely avoid this place on saturdays and sundays for the next 3 months because it is its like 15 people comfortably and community seating sucksthis is bakery has plenty of room to sit and chat  it even has comfy chairs and a comfy couch  the decor is simple yet elegant    we went in their first week open and i was sad that two different things i ordered off their menu they didnt have made       the coffee tasted great though and ohhhh the pecan croissant was fantastic  the best part was that we brought 5 babies in here and they were still more than happy to serve us dit was almost midnight on a tuesday and we had just returned home from a full 13 hour day of traveling we were hungry and tired instead of opting to go to a sit down place we decided to drive thru steak n shake it had been forever since we had been to one so looking at the menu was something we had to do i was hoping to get a chicken melt but i didnt see that on the menu instead they had a grilled chicken sandwich and that seemed to be the only chicken sandwich i saw so i ordered it my husband just wanted to order a burger with fries there was a car in front of us so we didnt think much of it we placed our order and were told to pull around to the window to pay the car in front of us was still waiting so thats exactly what we did too it took about 10 minutes for the car in front of us to get their meal and then we pulled up to pay once we paid we waited for about 67 minutes before our food was ready i guess its a good thing they cook our food to order but that was a long time to wait imo we were handed our bag we double checked it for accuracy with drinks and were on our wayhad the crawfish omlet pretty tasty didnt make my toes curl but it was decent was there at 930 on a thursday and didnt have to wait for a table there were a few open did wait a bit for the food though overall not bad  would go back againwas looking for a place to watch the philsreds game and since the drake was overflowing i decided it was time to give buckets a try chill atmosphere lots of tvs good mix of folks and cheap arteryclogging grub and yet the defining feature of the place  the one thing that came to represent our entire visit  was that it is a smoking bar i figured that meant that some people might smoke but no that means that all the people will definitely smoke a lot too much for me this joint was a chimney   i thought about giving it two stars but that seems unfair because it is what it is just because it aint my cup of tea doesnt mean i should give it a poor rating for other people this place will certainly be a gem if you want to smoke in a bar this place should probably get 4 or 5 stars because everything else about the place is pretty cool and there probably arent many other places out there that still let you light uptotally decent joint for a quick fresh breakfast  my wife the ultimate breakfast snob declared that her omelette was way better than mothers wasnt crazy about the blaring hip hop over the speakers but food was solid and they are open on thanksgivingim basing this review after visitig or attempting to visit pk several times now  i will begin by saying that i find the layout to be pretty good with the exception of the back room  something about dining there just makes you feel less connected to the normal energy and flow of the place   the beer selection is small but tastefully chosen  they always seem to have old speckled hen on tap  ive never had a problem ordering drinks even on packed bar nights  if youre eating at pk then you definitely want to have the burger  its pretty ridiculously awesome  ive had it three times now and it never disappoints me or any of the people ive dragged their with me  ive had the mussels as well and they were nomtastic  i have a feeling that all of their food is spot on and theres not a bad thing on the menu  i knock them down a couple stars because times i have gone there it has either been so packed that it wasnt worth the wait or because one hot summer evening i tried to go there and either they werent running the ac or they didnt have any  needless to say i had to leave  it was just too hot in there to enjoy any food  they dont take reservations which just bothers me for me if i know where im going in advance i want to call and have a table reserved for me  from the restaurants standpoint im sure they dont want to book up there tables for a bunch of no shows  i guess its just crappy because i feel that their level of food is of the quality where i should be able to reserve a table  i will make return trips  its always a nice place to stop in  maybe i just need to go some more i really want to give it more stars i just cant right nowits not a fancy seafood restaurant but worth a visit because its right at the end of the pier with beautiful views we had the rock crab claws clam chowder and oysters i felt like the rock crab was a bit over cooked because it was dry  but the clam chowder and oysters were yummythe pizza was good and as a delivery was right on time the wings where a little bland but it might have been the way i ordered them overall a good experiencedunks has the best coffee hands down however this location has service issues at times today i went through the drivethru after a fiasco at foxs donut den all i wanted was coffee i waited and waited finally i park and go inside i asked why i got no response from the drivethru and was told its broken the man behind the counter was nice and even gave me the coffee for free ill continue to go there only because there are few other dds in west nashville just be prepared though the coffee is outstanding the service is hit or missgot greek salad and spicy chicken wrap was able to change tortilla style but wish they did half wraps so i could get half salad half wrap fairly nice and quick service will try three stooges wrap next time a little more than i wanted to pay for food but thats to be expected with limited serving hours food seems as fresh as a chipotle or piada they did have smoothies and an array of salad dressings dessert selection minimalonly had 2 of 6 desserts at noonvery good donuts just loaded with lots of sugar  but still tastycustomer service was good  also seems like a place to study and relaxnothing beats a butter pecan black walnut ice cream on a waffle cone  the staff is professional and courteous  they do offer a sample if you are not sure which one that you want to tryive stopped in a few times  they do carry some products that you cant find in a regular supermarket  but for the most part you can get your typical spanish staples at a wal mart  its nice if you dont want to fight the crowds at a regular marketi love this place for its cool atmosphere and ny style decor i grabbed a king cake donut slice and a glazed and i have to say i was not blown away   the glazed donuts are a bit more cakelike which isnt necessary bad but i think for the size there needs to be a bit more glaze on it  te king cake had an interesting flavor to it which i though was just cinnamon but i think its a combo of other things that maybe i am just not used to   good will go back but not 100 sold yetgoing to rethink stopping here again  we have been to several pieology locations and have always had great service and a great meal  still got  great meal but their customer service needs a refresh and change   i wasnt greeted with a hello  just a blank starethe hello i gave was met with same blankannoyed gaze and a do you want salad or pizza  the rest of the process was went as planned ordered a drink went to fill the cup and theres no icei let the manager im assuming this know and he replies with yep its not working today thats it nothing else a heads up when he handed me the cup would have been nice or a note on the machine might saved him from being botheredclearly it did to have to repeat this as i wasnt the only one to say something  he did tell another customer he would refund his money if he didnt want to have all the extra liquid in his cup      we love pieologywell just hold off until we travel further south for another visitcoffee is usually hot  fresh they love to upsale you with every order they ask you at least 3xs if you want hash browns or a donut  it gets annoying when you say all you want is your coffeethe coffee is alright not the best ive had but its inexpensive and does the trick their cookies on the other hand are great order one with your coffee the have an array of sweet baked good i didnt try them but they looked quite yummy  the shop is small but nice with a few tables to hang outwork from the people working there were very nice the store front is easy to miss since but its on the corner of an industrial building  my rating is mostly for the coffee but the cookieservice rating is more like 4 stars if youre in the area this is a good optionegggggghh  some weird flavors  would like to see a couple classics  chocolate tasted funkyi may get some frowns for this review but i really dont care  i feel pretty generous in giving ted drewes three stars but it is just frozen custard there really is nothing special about it  ive had it on a few occasions since i dont really live near chippewa but people in st louis sure do dig it up im just as content as going to a nearby fritz or any other local ice creamcustard stand  maybe because i didnt grow up on it having moved to the area a few years ago but i dont see what is so special about it sure it tastes good but in my opinion there is nothing that distinguishes it from anyone else its not terrible its not great its just custard  that being said yes they do provide freebies if you are getting married my wife and i swung by on our wedding day and they gave out whatever we wanted to our wedding party and the photographer too good thing since it was the hottest day of 2010 but the custard was just like it was on all other trips average  so i would recommend stopping by if you are within a few block radius of the place just dont make a special pilgrimage to st louis just for ted drewes you will be disappointed if that is the casetwo of us took a friend for his birthday last night the lobster  bacon taco special was amazing i also had a southern fried and a fish taco  both great the ritas were good too  one slight negative with the experience we sat down about 830 to eat so not extremely late in my eyes at about 9 while we were eating a server came around collecting the candles from the tablesincluding ours and other tables people were seated at pretty inappropriate to grab away the candle from our table while we are still dining definitely a ok time for everyone to get out of here signalnew owner things have changed drink menu has grown havent tried many i personally think the thai iced tea is no longer the same however the vietnamese iced coffee is pretty good sadly last time i ordered boba it was too mushy it was near closing time i dont know if that had anything to do with it  theres a menu insert with newer items i would skip it maybe some of the items are worth a shot but im too scared to try now one night i ordered the chicken pan fried noodle to go and to my despair it was not what i expected i dont know what happened in my mind the dish looked different even the picture on the menu was different i even wondered if it was a mistake imagine crispy deep fried noodles like the ones you put on top of a chinese chicken salad drenched in a sauce with barely any chicken not the most pleasant experience  for now im sticking to the egg rolls bnh mi sandwiches rice dishes bn bowls and iced coffee i wish the broth was tastier dont usually buy pho here unless im craving a hot bowl of soup i genuinely enjoy vietnamese cuisine and crave it often but some menu items here are a miss i really like those places where the menu is small but you know everything tastes amazing this place has variety but most dishes are mediocre alas i still come here its conveniently near campus and sometimes you need some egg rolls to get you through finals right this place is just plain too crowded every time i go the food is pretty good weve had some bad service issues twice where they brought all the food for everyone but skipped someone at the table by the time they brought it we were finishedim torn between 34 stars  love the variety of pastries decent menu too food isnt amazing you look around and its definitely more of an older crowd id go again if in the area but wouldnt go out of my way   staff was really friendly and on top of helpingi always hear about federal donuts and how you have to get there early 10am on a saturday morning this location was completely empty   the doughnuts are nothing special in my opinion the texture was good but its just your typical cake doughnut that can be made at home if you had a fryer they were all the same doughnuts with just a different sugar or glaze over it i tried four flavors but none of them particularly stood out to me  the fried chicken wasnt bad it was moist but again nothing to rave about it comes with a honey doughnut but i didnt get any pickles as stated on the online menu i had a dry topping and a wet topping for the dry topping i chose the coconut curry it tasted more like regular curry powder dusted over the chicken with no hints of coconut  and the chicken   coming from new york i think everything was pretty reasonably pricedloved the turkey wrap with goat cheese and cranberries what excited me the most was that they used real sliced turkey and not deli thin processed turkey i was so very happy about that this has become my new favorite place for turkey wraps and all things salad on my 2nd visit i tried the tuna salad loved all the yummyness they added like cashews grapes and cranberries yes this is a great spot the atmosphere is lovely the service was great lots of smiles the beer lady was friendly and helpful my first go with fat bottom ginger beer  new fan thanks phat bitesdecent pizza decent service and decent prices  was not wowed or underwhelmed  it is good for a quick bite or if you have kids with you  the have nice big booths so if you are with a group you will fit at one booth  ny style piethey were nice and gave my sweet little 18lb baby a puppachino   he looked like scaly wag when he got it all over his little pug face   they were very polite however dogs are not allowed we had to eat it in the parking lot while walking my sweet little pug friend i couldnt help but notice the amount of cancer sticks thrown behind starbucks landscaping shame on you starbucks employees keep southport beautifuli am new to the area and heard so many great things about this place the first time i tried it i got the pot roast and mashed potatoeswas not impressed then again i come from a southern family so its hard to beat home cooked i decided to give it another try with a thai tuna wrapagain not impressed thai food has so much flavor but this fell way short of what youd expect the food is good but definitely not exceptional and not for the price maybe a third time would be a charmi like this place the staff is always nice they dont take togo orders which is really inconvenient for people who work in the middle of the day and want to just stop by and pick up an order they are kind of pricey compared to the hub which is a coffe place i love  other than that the coffee is good and so is the foodcheap and delicious food you cant go wrong with that the food is good however they cook your eggs in a microwave they dont really have a real functioning kitchen  if it is busy dont be in a hurryapparently some sort of miscommunication on the coffee thing they have a new machine ready to go now im toldgood niu ro mien very flavorful with an emphasis on balance noodle can be better but soup is very good  rice with ground pork can use more fattier pork to further enhanced the flavor but never the less it is good with flavor siu xiao bing the dough should be thinner and a little bit too oily crispy chicken with basil is very good very flavorful and juicy  crispy pork cutlet has the right balance of salty and sweetness  overall very authentic in flavor and i like it why 3 stars because i am picky and they can have improvementsthe atmosphere is great drinks are unique the reason im giving 3 stars is because i feel like the food quality had gone down hill the last couple times i have eaten there the food has come out cold i guess its better to go during lunchtime instead of dinneri love their chalupas and tacos but i have to give them 3 stars bc they have gotten my order wrong numerous timesprep and pastry is just okay a lot of hype good food  not great we will have to give i a another try maybe picked the wrong daynoticed it was noisy to a faultfood was very good however service is certainly not exceptional  overall good place for breakfast and lunchi stopped in the past sunday evening there were a few other groups there so the noise was ok the parents had there kids under control which is also a plus i ordered the crab cake appetizer shrimp bisque soup and shrimp ravioli they did bring out the appetizer while i was still working on the soup but no issues after that  the soup was pretty good the crab cakes were soso and the ravioli with 3 shrimp on the side were also good the ravioli came with a sauce that was similar to the shrimp bisque the total was around 30 including bread and a drink overall i had a good experience and would go back they must be reading these reviewsgreat atmosphere the breakfast is good just like at a diner prices are high service was fast for the price i wanted something more than a diner experience although it was just breakfast short hills is know for their luncheswe wandered into broken beaker on a friday night every other bar around it was full so i found it a little odd that there were only a few people inside what seemed like a really cool concept i had a jolly rancher test tube shot and my husband had a tiny rick which is heavy on jalapeo infused alcohol the bartender we had was nice attentive and gave us a lot of good information about the menu we were sitting at the end of the bar though and employees were discussing their day to day like they were in a break room there were some games on but no music so i felt like i was in the middle of their conversation the presentation of the drinks was really cool its nice that they offer distillery tours i think with some small improvements this place could be a lot more on target with what they are going for the ambiance could be a lot cooler with the science theme some interactive projects or more of a lab feel it feels like it hasnt quite committed to the theme some different choices in lighting music and decor could do a lot for the place we will go back probably to show our friends who come to town but the challenge is really getting past the show and creating a regular stream of customers which will mean creating a physical environment that people want to stay inthis place is just ok  the service was good and so is the decor but was sort of disappointed with the ny strip the lamb osso buco was pretty good and so was the short rib appetizer35 im some what torn on this  gluten free yes item specific clearly marked on menu dairy free yes item specificclearly marked on menu  first and for most i love the concept especially since paleo tends to lead towards more gluten free dining it is important to note that like all most all indy restaurants they cannot claim to be gluten free as they dont meet a host of requirement and do not have dedicated kitchen space for this reason they are gluten friendly  tipshighlights   the welcome shot of olive oil is a nice touch if youre unsure about it i would suggest taking small sips if you arent adventurous enough to chug the whole thing   the menu broken up into courses as well specifically calls out vegangluten friendly options nook also breaks out the paleo and keto geared options with the macros broken out   the food was ok the food was filling fresh healthy and filling other than that there wasnt one dish that i had stole bites from other members in my party that makes me really want to go back asap   the dinner wasnt exactly a quick it was more of a prolonged experience   initially they didnt have a reservation system setup when they first opened they now use opentable which they list as offering limited reservations thought your guess is as good as mine as to how many tables they keep open for nonreservations   cocktail bar they truly mean cocktail bar no food service is provided   parking its downtown so parking can be a crap shoot in availability and cost especially when there are events going on at what its currently bankers life fieldhousename to be changed pending the highest bidder   overall its nice to see a gfcf dinning option available in the downtown areafirst of all jeffersons is straight up sports grille food burgers fries wings etc which is fine by me as i like that kind of thing my meal started with their fried pickles recommend on the their menu which were some of the best i have ever had they have my highest compliments on their fried pickles the burger on the other hand was not that great but not that bad either in other words the burger was perfectly average my one side mac n cheese was just average as well i have had better out of a box   to sum up the fried pickles are a must have in this restaurant as they are fantastic the burger on the other hand is perfectly average nothing to special here but nothing bad here eitherthis place is hidden away by the slots and against the wall towards the other side of the casino downstairs  i wouldve never known that there would be food court there but pretty convenient i suppose since you dont have to walk all the way to the middle of the casino and up the escalator and down to the other side towards circus circus to grab a quick bite  this place had asian food mexican food american food and a deli  i couldnt make up my mind what i wanted even though the menu was very limited for each section but i ended up getting some beef chowmein which was pretty good  its cooked to order so they make it there right in front of you  my mom always get the shrimp fried rice and in my opinion i wouldnt get it because it was too plain my cousin wanted to add noodles to her wonton soup but the cook said no which i dont understand why when there was a bunch of noodles there and we wouldve paid the extra charge  the pad thai there is definitely not the one you get at your usual thai restaurant either they just threw a bunch of meat together and stir fry it with vegetables so dont expect that tamarind taste with the peanuts in there  the noodle soup looked plain too i think my cousins got the wonton which doesnt come with noodle and one got the chicken and i didnt hear good things about  next time i come here i would probably just stick with the deli items or the beef chowmein  oh they also serve breakfast here too  the name says it all though fresh express food court so expect a little below mediocre foodhusband loves the chicken burgers and i like the original burger  we almost never go there maybe once a year when we crave for it  service ok they tend to mix up orders in drivethruoh schlafly i remember when you were owned by tom schlafly  you were full of life then  you did innovative things with you beers and you did them well  you were a creative restauranteur you had a menu with interesting tasty selections for four pages not the twosided narrow piece of plastic laminate franchisequality flavored greasefood your restaurant now sells your beers are still good  no doubt the new owner bought your brewing recipes in the sale but your brewing competition in the st louis brewing community is at least your equal now  in selling your company to people who obviously know nothing about brewing or restauranting tom schlafly has replaced the art of the daring brewrestauranteur with passive soulless investors willing to phone in the spirit of a once great st louis business story three stars for the beer alonethis placeexists its in a building alongside courtyard caf underneath a ucsb parking lot past the engineering building oceanside its quite hard to find if you dont come regularly  anyways when i ordered my beef a la carte im on low carb the cashier lady who didnt understand english very well tried to get my name for the order and it was a struggle i had to spell out george three times before she just gave up and just spelt it as georte which was quite amusing in my opinion at least after i waited for my name to be called she stopped the cook from swindling me by switching the kiddie sized petri dish and hooking me up with a big takeoutsized platter of beef props for making up for the spelling mistake with lots of food   back to the actual review most people dont know that this place even exists on campus but all the engineering students like me do even then expect long lines of engineering peeps and the seats being mostly taken however the order was finished fairly quickly   most of their items cost more than the panda express in the hub while portions are smaller for example the takeout plates that i saw were about half the size of what youd get for a 2 entree 1 side panda express where youd pay 7 to 9 for most entrees or 5 for the a la carte that i got   beef was pretty standard like other yoshinoyas its kind of oily without the rice and noodles but i like it greasy and tender as a keto person comes with grilled onions   decent place filled me enough and the service was good in that one instance i didnt like how the backroom chefs could be so stingy thoughi came here for brunch on a saturday and was underwhelmed dont order the banana french toast i had to ask our waiter if mine actually had bananas in it and was told that bananas are in the dough soit was banana bread french toast which sounds amazing except there was zero banana flavor whatsoever my dad had the blondie benedict though which was amazing the rosemary hollandaise was truly delicious my boyfriend got the chorizo flatbread and was disappointed my mother tried the gooey butter cake which shed never had before my parents were visiting us in st louis and its one of the citys culinary staples and was happy with what she got  the coffee was fine the service was fine the ambiance was fineoverall my experience was nothing special if you find yourself in downtown stl and the more acclaimed breakfastbrunch restaurants are too busy blondies is an okay alternative and not expensive which almost makes up for its menus general lack of flavori have only been there once and even though i really like the style decor and everything the food and choices offered definitely had some room for improvement  they did not have other options to whole milk and not many pastry optionsthe beer and nachos are great here however the service that i experienced while ordering nachos on june 20 at about 45pm was horrible the guy taking my order at the kitchen wearing a mustache obviously hated his job i was extremely nice to him and he treated me like s this is my first time writing a yelp review and he is the reason why   i would definitely go back but would not order any food if i saw him therethis is the walmart  closest to my house so i seem to always go there by default however i might be finding a new one the past few times ive been the meat selection hasnt been that great and last night the deli counter whew it took us 25 minutes to finish our order the deli person was super slow had to ask her co worker a question about every single thing we asked for and oh before she even took our order we stood and watched her put away the meats from the other customer verrryyy slowly it was super aggravating and ill tell you one thing if we do go back to this walmart for groceries we are definitely  skipping the lunch meat countermaybe i didnt order the right thing i had a latte and it was decent but i couldnt taste as much of the espresso and tasted much of the cream from the latte art my friends got the drafts and it was also just ok in my book perhaps i would appreciate the pour overs more but one would expect all the coffee drinks to be solid in a coffee house it looked like their drink menu was limited to pour overs espresso latte and drafts so none of the pizzaz of sbux drinks were kinda pricey for the size and quality imho  the space was free and inviting in fact most of the tables were filled the large windows allowed for lots of light which was great on a sunny day like that dayyumioca is nestled in the same plaza as lets grill tropika and syphay ive been here one time previously but never realized that theyre owned by the same people as tropika   both times that ive come its been dead we were the only ones there on a recent monday evening the inside is quite nice and several different areas to lounge around they have a couple shelves of board games but some arent in the best shape saw connect 4 monopoly scrabble and jenga the asian coloured version selection isnt the greatest   only one worker was manning the front they were out of lychee pieces huh and only had enough tapioca pearls for half a drink i know it was near the end of the night but thats still pretty ghetto    vanilla bubble tea 495  l and jboy shared a vanilla bbt tasted like vanilla ice cream in drink format a little too sweet for my taste buds   mango slush 515  went with mango bear pieces slush was pretty good except  several sips had bits of ice that hadnt been crushed enough   decent enough bbt here but i wouldnt be making a special trip out for itvegetarianveganmeat friendly tasty food but i always feel mildly sick afterwards service is friendly very average espresso this place gets very busy the chai tea is famous but too sweet for me actually all nonmeal food ive had from here has been too sweet but thats my own faulti dont like sweet food  this place is popular for a reason you cant go wrong with remedyalthough you wont see me theresometimes when you have a hangover all that will cure it is biscuits from cracker barrel so you drive to your local cracker barrel hope there isnt too long of a line and you get a table you order chicken fried chicken and some of that hashbrown casserole and biscuits you wash it all down with diabetesinducing sweet tea and you dont care that this is a chain or that the food isnt that great its salty its greasy its processed all that you care about is that you got food in your stomach asap this cracker barrel is just like all the other cracker barrels mediocre chain food mediocre chain service mediocre chain atmosphere and as with all cracker barrels try to get there early or at offpeak timesafter years of hype ive finally tried federal donuts theyre good as donuts gonot greasy kind of cakey but not dense  we got one of each flavor and shared them as a group back at home without knowing which donut was which it was honestly hard to tell what flavors they were on the ones dipped in flavored sugars the flavors werent terribly strong i liked the chocolate donut best  next visit i look forward to trying their chickena very interesting and upscale bar at least after they changed owners that has some crazy flavoured drinks the prices are a bit high and the drinks can taste syrupy and yet i still go back their when a friend wants to have a good cosmo somehow you cant beat their cosmopolitans just okthere are better ayce tha joint tokyo etc too much rice too much sauce they also have another location in carson city same thing thereupon walking into this dimly lit pub you wouldnt necessarily get an accurate idea of what the menu is made up of sure there are classic pub staples like fish and chips but alongside that there is a vegan counterpart this place is truly a vegetarianvegan haven boasting an exciting and expansive menu geared towards this demographic one major downfall is service however come here expecting slow and often rude interactions with your server unless you happen to be lucky enough to get kristi as your serverthen youre in luck oh and keep an eye out for their jalapeno beerafter trying it just once i think about it oftenthis place was very hard to find upon entering the campus there are no signs directing you to the restaurant other than this place being hard to find the food is goodi like my pie better this seemed to chaotic and didnt have pies home made giant meatballs didnt give any plates and no place to throw away your mess  one trash by door but it said recycle i dont know if it was the red sauce but it was very saltytldr  cheap prices best biscuit no thrills  usually my breakfast spot in the area is nickis omelette and grill big fan of everything they do but looking into breakfast on yelp we saw the ranch house pop up and figured wed give it a shot i had driven past it countless times but as it closes after 2 pm had never had a chance to go  as described by others the decor is out of the 70s wood walls faded leather booths feels more like something from a small southern town then tampa crowd was mostly families and elderly  the menu is large  a lot of staples like different omelettes pancakes biscuits and gravy waffles also a lot of named combinations that include all of the above a lot of options and at a cheap price  girlfriend got a biscuit and gravy with eggs and bacon i went with the southern fried steak biscuit mashed potatoes and gravy and home fries mmm carbs  the food was ok i definitely feel nickis food taste better as well as having better coffee but the price was hard to beat you get your moneys worth here but if youre willing to spend a little more head a bit east  also the biscuit was the best ive had in tampa big and buttery this would be worth coming fori really want to give taj india a break because i really appreciate them for being there northeast philly is desperate for decent indian food and taj is definitely decent indian food decent sometimes great sometimes kind of lacking but almost always decent however as far as indian food goes ive had much better for the same or similar price within 2030 minute driving distance   i never eat in the place its a little depressing looking and often with weird music playingbut its cleani just prefer home in this case  oh they also have a wide array of indian desserts but i think they  might be too authentic for most americans tastenot sureim not into trying random sweets but thats what ive heard  stuff i love about taj they make dosas but also do a good job at north indian dishes like channa masala fairly cheap call in your order and pick it up the food reheats fairly well in a warm oven or a quick dump into a pot on the stove viola like new oh and its all vegetarian   stuff i dont love i have to ask 5 times to get enough mint chutney the sambhar is a little salty at times some of the curries arent that good dont do the black dahl go for channa masala also the naans are really good as are a lot of the appetizers including the samosas   all in all its a great find for the area but its sometimes hit or miss on some of the dishes however the naan samosas and channa masala have been consistantly goodi can say we have been coming to han d for the past 7 years or so and have been very happy with our meals   we like the americanized menu they serve and the food is better than the other chinese restaurants in the area  they do not get a 5 as i agree with other posters that each of the few employees have way too many hats to wear at times i have to get up to hail a waitstaff member rushing by to get their attention for a question or water refill hire more staff during busy times stumbled across the village pub  beer garden on a busy saturday night and decided the place looked hoppin so why not give it a try   walked into the busy bar and we were immediately greeted by a nice host who informed us that it was spot a seat take a seat type seating it brought a competitive edge to our dining experience he also informed us that it was a smoking establishment outside on the patio he was very nice explained to us some beers and offered to get us one while we waited for a table to open up   the ambiance was a little too college bar for me very crowded loud and smoke filled we patiently waited for a table that we were stalking to open up and swooped in when we saw our chance they were either under staffed or overwhelmed with the crowd because flagging down a server was a difficult task our server seemed too busy to explain to us anything on the menu or any beer we might want to try that and it was almost too loud for me to hear my friend sitting just inches in front of me this was on the patio  when our food finally arrived it came out nice and hot i had the bratwurst rueban and my partner in crime had the blackened chicken sandwich all of their sandwiches come on pretzel bread literally a pretzel cut in half as bread which was a cool spin on a sandwich they were both delicious and something different    overall the pub was fine nothing special and no place to take a date way too loud if you are looking to get a few drinks and maybe it would be better not on a saturday night it seems like a good place to grab a sandwich and beeri had heard good things about this brewpub and was excited to try it  first of all its very noisy so be prepared  i was disappointed in the beer list  we visited in the middle of december and there was not a stout or a porter anywhere on the list  to not offer a winter type of beer during december i found to be very strange  the food was not exceptional at all  three of us ordered tacos and for 11 to 13 a plate we received only two tacos per order  we ordered a side of fries at 5 and received probably 15 to 20 of them  overall i was disappointed and would not go backwent with the family for a late lunchdecided on baileys range over crown candyburgers were tasty but small for 11shakes were ok not greatthe atmosphere was cool but didnt seem real cleanand while the server was nice he was inattentive and actually added a couple of items to the bill that we never ordered  was really hoping for a better experiencecame for lunch on the recommendation of a native louisianan   shrimp basket was good mac  cheese reminded me of easy mac with bread crumbs added not impressed   poboy bread was good shrimp was not the same as the basket more popcorn shrimp that nice sized   no sweet tea  why really no seriously why   boiled shrimp appetizer had no cajun seasoning was simply just boiled with garlic very lack luster   probably wouldnt come back but maybe its due to us coming when they had just opened for the day either way was not impressedi want this place to get better because its across the street from me and well id rather give them my money than walk down to phileo   however   they need to seriously look at their prices because if mine was 285 bucks and half price because it was opening week thats going to be a problem considering 1 i put 1 small plop of ice cream in my dish with 4 blueberries and 8 mms the cup itself theyre oversized wasnt even 13 full sowell i think their price per oz may be a bit ridiculous   i was there for opening day and alex is right it wasnt frozen yogurt it tasted like ice cream and upset my stomach like ice cream usually does   why would you put blueberries out with stems on them when you wash your blueberries is it not customary to remove the stems as the common ice cream goer does not intend to eat said stems  anyway regardless of my howevers im bound to try this place again as it is literally across the street from me i want to love this place like i love little italy pizza and chapterhouse cafe but they need to find room in their budget for quality at decent prices that is how you will get repeat visits from me so we will see what comes as time moves out from herethe food was good and the atmosphere was that superloud sushi bar scene which some people like but really what stunk was the service ive never tipped to crappily and i still feel bad about it but really he was terrible the food sat under the hot light for a long time and lets not even talk about how long we had to wait for our check there was no way we were paying with a credit card because that would have taken another ten years  the funny thing is the bar staff was great i felt bad not tipping more because i liked the staff at the bar they kind of knew there was something up with the waiter at one point the manager yelled at the waiter after wed asked twice if we could pay and leave and still the waiter didnt come by sheeshmy friend was in town for the last night before she flew back to vietnam and she wanted an american meal  what is more american than grilled cheese    she went with the baja melt and tomato soup while i went for the honey apple and corn chowder  both soups were amazing  the tomato soup may be the best i ever had    the sammies were ok  hers tasted like a quesadilla oddly enough i guess that isnt odd since both are just vehicles for cheese  mine needed something  perhaps another cheese since the cheddar ended up pretty oily  i know that is the nature of cheddar but watching oil drip out of your sandwich is not appetizing    a glutton for dairy my friend also ordered a chocolate milkshake which was gross  just kidding it was so good  the staff was super friendly and more than welcoming  they were playing the muppets movie in the corner  i know that i should have paid more attention to my friend as i wont see her for months but it was the muppets and she understoodgirlfriend and i went here for a late night dessert on a sunday around 9 the atmosphere was nice appropriately quiet perfect date atmosphere without being overly romantic  the service was good  i had a cup of french onion soup which was fine but far from noteworthy  between our chocolate tort and apple crisp neither of us was impressed with the desserts  i wouldnt mind returning to give dinner a fair shot but will skip desserti met family from out of town at morning call so we could catch up as i live out of state but grew up on the westbank  i wasnt impressed to be honest  for starters i had to put my own powdered sugar on the beignets which ive never had to do and i eat beignets at least once a year when im in town  their beignets were a little fluffier than other places but ive had much better  ill only come here again if its the only way to see family otherwise ill stick with cafe du mondei ordered the brisket meal to go  the lean brisket portion was very dry and the fatty portion was just full of fat there wasnt a happy medium  the brisket did have good flavoring from the sauce  the mac  cheese didnt disappoint  the corn bread was not what i expected a bit dry but enjoyed the spicinesswhat a cool atmosphere  the place succeeds in being post modern and cozy at the same time   i liked being there  i did not have the hamburgers which looked good and popular  this is about the doughnuts  if you really love doughnuts you will probably be disappointed in these  there is a weird texture to them that is quite breadlike they reminded us of very plain kingcake    they are very oversized looking like small pillows  the basics were the best  the cinnamon doughnut and the pink sugar one were the best if you accept that this is really a doughnut  the custard filled and chocolate glazed seemed good at first but soon you taste that subliminal chemical taste of industrial strength custard and chocolate icing all this stuff seems from commercial mixes    it gets really scary when you get to the so called fancy doughnuts  chocolate mint has a weird brown filling that tastes like spearmint toothpaste  the thyme flavored was completely unedible and the peanut butter and jelly had a cheap canned jelly surrounded by fake whipped cream atop a doughnut filled with a weird peanut like filling  on of my friends observed that they should have just sliced a doughnut and used real peanut butter and jelly inside if you are not a doughnut nut these might work for you  the people working there were so nice loved the place would go back  but as a doughnut lover i would never go back for  the doughnutswhy 3 stars  my first visit was less than up to par the second was redeemed by some great guacamole and awesome server  the main food was still a little hit or miss with being greasy and slightly over cooked but i am willing to look past it as a slammed night and give it another shot the flavor was good and i will be back to give them another shot at the elusive 4th or 5th stari came here for their happy hour ive always heard great things about maynards so its definitely a place i would love to try for dinner next time i got a cocktail called the heritage it was mixed perfectly the bartender got some skills he was a great server as well even though he had to walk all the way around the bar to help us he did it as often as he need to make sure we were take care of the bar burger was hugeunbelievably youd think for a bar burger it would be much smaller but im sure it was their regular size dinner burger chargrilled meat cooked perfectly squeeze in between tomatoes lettuce and chargrilled bun yum the only surprising thing is there was bleu cheese that the boyfriend overread we dont like bleu cheese so we just scraped it off otherwise it was good and we cant wait to try the pizettes and dinnerthis review pertains only to saigon market i will save the restaurant for another review  this is probably my least favorite asian market in town and probably asian for that matter  but they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then    even though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the asian market  you wont find rib eyes or filet mignon here but more rustic cut such as pork belly pork shoulder beef shank beef loin and innards  the second benefit is the one male worker i think hes the butcher stocking boy and cleaner  hes pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat  if i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way hell be on it  his english isnt very good but i think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for   their vegetable selection is limited and caters to asian cooking  out of all the asian market on lafayette road saigon has the worst vegetables   they always look like they are dead or near dead   the herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh  if you are wanting to buy vegetables though i say skip saigon and go to saraga or oriental market   saigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like vans fish market   check expiration dates especially on canned goods and i would be careful of frozen items as well  i always make sure i do a thorough examination    saigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits and you can find them scatter up by the register  the owner usually stands behind the register she usually doesnt say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them  i wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because i enjoy grocery shopping  overall saigon would be a meh experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another stara good second place when you are looking for a typical breakfast place downtown  a little bit pricey but the quality is good and sometimes great  today i had a mexi moon without cheese along with a glutenfree pancake which tasted the same as buttermilk so good unless i didnt get my glutenfree cant be sure it was delicious  that omelet was so delicious ill be back several more times to have it again  very mouthwatering savory goodnessi should know better than to try to eat a bagel in california at 9am it wasnt empty but not busy we were the only ones waiting for food it took them 15 minutes to toast a mediocre bagel and put it in a box with capers cream cheese and onions prepackaged separately based on the 5 days prior date scrawled in sharpie on the plastic cup they forgot my tomatoes not very cute for the momandpop vibe they have going  barista was fast at least good latte and cold brew i should have just ordered a pastry thoughthis review is only for their giant fortune cookies  i ordered a giant chocolate covered fortune cookie back in october 2013 because my fiance and i wanted a creative way to ask his uncle to marry us  we thought what better way than to put it in a giant fortune cookie i typed out a personalized message when i was ordering the cookie but had some issues with the format of the message i contacted their customer service and derek immediately addressed my concerns and helped me with my order  we were so excited to give my fiances uncle the fortune cookie a couple of days after it arrived it came nicely packaged and the fortune cookie looked awesome the message inside was also formatted exactly how i wanted it to look  the only negative thing was that the fortune cookie was not edible we tried eating it and it almost hurt our teeth trying to bite into it maybe i just got a bad cookie because most of the other reviewers cant stop talking about how amazing they tasted it was slightly disappointing that we couldnt eat it but we all laughed about it and dont regret ordering the cookie  5 stars for presentation customer service and fast shipping 1 star for taste  chocolate was good but the cookie was as hard as a rock  i would probably think twice before ordering another giant fortune cookie thoughi used to love trader joes i started shopping  the w 86th st location back around 2000 now that i no longer live close to that location i go to the 82nd st location i dont come here often to tell you the truth and today was a prime example as to why that is  surely i thought that all the bible belters would still be at church at 1030 am nope parking lot was probably 50 cars deep i walk in and its like there is a famine going on it looked like a typical day before thanksgiving at tjs not an average sunday morning  while i only needed a few things its still difficult to navigate around the narrow aisles while people are literally having get togethers in the aisles you dullards do realize the place is only the size of a large bp gas station right and the wee tots scurry around with the miniature tj grocery carts which i hate it aint a playground and sometimes i want to growl at the little shits as they ram their carts into my shins you know what i feel like saying to the parents who let their kids drive those carts around like mario andretti well remember that scene in the movie patch adams when mitch says to patch  this isnt a game to me this isnt playtime this is serious business  youtube link here to get the full effect starts  50 second mark  httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvjnn6fi1gcr8  well thats how i feel about my grocery shopping  manners fuggedabowdit i said excuse me no less than five times while there and not once did the savage beasts say it back to me being there today you wouldve thought the apocalypse had started like a bunch of tj zombies sidling back and forthback and forth it has always been a mix of hipsters and yuppies and i really never had a problem with that but just the whole vibe has changed i no longer enjoy shopping there and that sucks  it aint what it was 10 years ago that i can guarantee i dont even think the products are as good as they were 10 years ago and the prices have definitely gone up i used to buy 16 ounces of quinoa for less than two bucks now its more than double that price they never get new beer selections like they used to and theres a myriad of products that they no longer carry much to my dismay long gone are the days of 499 sixpack 16 ounce bottles of ekstra lithuanian ale dried gooseberries hemp chips seaweed wrapped rice crackers sicilian blood orange juice i could go on but im already depressed  oh trader joedont make me forsake youlet me start out by saying my partner and i think pontis deserves a solid 35 for our first meal from the newly opened establishment we also plan on giving it another chance and will hopefully amend our star rating in accordance  weve been waiting a while for a truly awesome cheesesteak in conshy and were hoping pontis delivers  our experience  we ordered take out and it was ready promptly  their menu features primarily you guessed it steaks and spuds although they have many iterations and some very creative ones at that reading their menu reminded me of reading the menu at rutgers grease trucks lots of items in a big fat sandwich in addition to steaks and smothered spuds they have hot dogs a salad shakes and a few other fryer made foods i noticed they use liscios rolls the philadelphia standard so that is a big bonus  i ordered simple figuring if they had the the basics down id try something new the next go around my plain chicken cheesesteak with provolone had a great meat flavor lightly peppered but fell short in the cheese department a dry cheesesteak is just a sin im planning on trying the whiz next time since the provolone was not a win  my partner ordered a buffalo bill aka a buffalo chicken cheesesteak this chicken steak was on point the perfect ratio of meat to roll with cheese and sauce mixed in the whole thing was moist and flavorful and frankly i was jealous  we each got a side order of fries i opted for the basic side and really enjoyed them your standard boardwalk fry flavor my partner paid 3 more to get a small copy cat cheese curds melted on top of fries with brown gravy and it was a disappointment it wasnt what he had expected and not really worth the extra dollars for the flavors  pontis were happy to have you in conshy we are hopeful that the kinks will get worked out and well get to rate you higher perhaps its not fair to write a review since i just got back from ca i know americanmex texmex and auth mexican  first thing is the mole mole is never sweet it is spicy  yes it has chocolate as an ingredient but that type of chocolate is not sweet refried tasted like canned chips and salsa good shrimp crviche to die for mussels delicious  will try again  a suggestion only for el gallo grande have your beer mugs ice coldi heard a lot of hype about this place from locals they told me that the quintessential tucson place was el nene and their sonoran hot dog  the service was ok and the dogs were cheap but there was nothing really special about the dogs they were ok it was just a hog with a bunch of toppings i can do that at home not a particularly quality frank  would i go back if i was really close and hungry yes otherwise no it is not really worth making a couple mile trip forlong lines and slightly disorganized in the distribution component  food was good but not the best available at the public market by far as it was rather blandloved the iced mocha more than the quiche i ordered the atmosphere and service is great better than starbucksmaybe it was too high expectations but the woman who took our order  didnt know if the ribs were baby backs or not  kale slaw was on menu but they didnt have instead we got rice and beans which were highly bland and disappointing the tacos were good but just good the duclaw beer was fabulous and we ate outside on street not a pretty street i might add but it was less than 30 and it was satisfying but not exciting or amazing by a long shot not inclined to returnive been here several times because i live close i love the rewards program i get 1 off almost every time i go i use to think this was the best froyo until i tried a really good place off of prytania now orange leafs flavors dont have enough flavor for me i still go because its a quick fix for my craving the staff is wishy washy and if you want to try something they hold on to those little cups for dear life my other spot gives you a handful and let you have at it all in all its ok for what it isim very torn about how to rate this place i think we had a one off experience and it might have had something to do with it being during devour downtown but we met some friends here initially we sat upstairs outside in the lounge seating  our server was justin and he was incredible we ordered some appetizers of the empanadas and brussels sprouts both very tasty our drinks were wonderful as well we decided to grab a table and have dinner and justin was able to remain our server which we were happy about this was at about 630 we ordered our food around 7ish two of us ordered from the devour menu and two did not i saw our server ring our food in we didnt get our appetizers included as part of devour until almost 8pm we noticed not a lot of food was coming out so assumed maybe there was an issue in the kitchen then as we were waiting for our entrees we noticed many tables who were sat after us getting their food we were getting a little frustrated and quite frankly pretty hungry at this point our food finally arrived around 845 by the time we got it it was too dark to even see my food it tasted pretty good but the look of the food is a big part of what appeals to my appetite dessert came with the devour menu and we ordered the churros so all in all we left pretty disappointed but i will try it again they were good and took our entrees off our bill am i wrong for rating this as 3 stars i think i have to because i feel like i missed out on really experiencing the foodwait staff good always find a seat quickly but the last 2 times we were there it took nearly an hour for pancakes and an omelet  thats  just ridiculous  maybe give it one more try and hopefully those were flukesi really wanted to like this place since there are no thai restaurants to speak of on the east side the food wasnt bad it was just okay the spring rolls were average but the pad thai was disappointing  the flavoring was on the bland side and very watery if i were already at the mall i would give them another try but definitely not something i would go out of my way fori tried pomme cafe last weekend as its on my favorite street of restaurants in clayton to start we had a great bottle of pinot noir recommended by the waiter and caesar salad the caesar was excellent next we had the burger which was probably the best ive had in st louis thus far and the cavatappi pasta the cavatappi pasta was lighter than i pictured and the sauce seemed nonexistent for a sausage pasta it really didnt taste like much if i go back i would order the caesar and burger again and try out the gnocchi overall service was good and atmosphere is cute for a date on the quieter sidegood food and very fast service  the shawny pawny and roasted red pepper soup are delicious however the soup wasnt piping hot personal preference and they lost a couple stars on portion size and value  for an 810 dollar lunch you can get a much healthier portion of food elsewhere within walking distance downtown    if youre in the mood for something light and not on a super tight budget check it outexcellent burger place and very creative with their menu staff is very friendly and accommodating and knowledgeable esp the slim guy up front ringing the orders  he makes some great suggestions u ask why only 35 i love everything about the place but i have yet to give a restaurant a 5 and 4 are scarce too and also cant its a burger place if we r looking at only bar food this place is easily top 5 in my listfirst to get the bad out of the way  no reservations  this disturbing trend by some new restaurants we really dont give a  if we inconvenience you we just dont want to mess with reservations is particularly an issue at the livery as even at 530 the bar was already pretty much full  so you can try to squeeze in around the bar where the servers are looking annoyed because youre in their way you are or you can sit on a bench in the foyer not knowing if youll get a table in 30 minutes or 4 hours  totally unacceptable in my book  now the good   the food is awesome  as is typical of the cunningham group restaurants the menu is well thought out with latin american themed small plates and entrees  we tried quite a few and they were all tasty with an interesting amalgamation of flavors and seasonings  service was good with the servers well trained on the menu options  so overall a good experience especially since we didnt have to wait too long but i wouldnt try it on a weekend after 6 pm or so unless your time is so unworthy that you want to sit around indefinitely for a tablenot enough granola on a 11 aa bowl i asked for more and only got a small sprinkle thats all that was missing a crunch it was basically a smoothie you spooned  ill go back to try some toast but not for a bowlcold coffee under cooked and under seasoned fries no bathroom sent us outside to the restrooms which were locked rushed us out the door super quick i have been wanting to try jr forever just super bummed that is wasnt goodor fun the burger was mediocre  and thats because the brioche bun brought up the ranking shakes were good  only saving graceservice was good but i expected a bit more from the pancakes being they are the pancake pantry  i definitely recommend their hash browns and hot saucethe food here is hit and miss especially lately the popcorn chicken was excellent the first few times but the last two times it was overly salty and soggy the noodle dishes are sometimes bright and fresh but other times are soggy and boringwent to baileys on a suggestion from my son after a cards game there were six of us so we were able to taste quite a few things  for appetizers we tried the fried pickles and smoked jalapeo chicken wings our party enjoyed both appetizers the pickles were perfect with a delightful batter if you are a fan of jalapeos please order the chicken wingsthe jalapeo flavor is very prevalent  as far as the burgers are concerned we ordered daves chop house  the gyro carolina bison and the buffalo   the gyro was our least favorite mainly because it didnt taste like a gyro the lamb meat was very bland and the cucumber sauce was nonexistent   the buffalo was juicy and flavorful it tasted as expected  daves burger was just ok we were looking to taste more bacon but the rosemary was overwhelming i ended up taking the meat and just eating it without the bread and toppings  the carolina bison was the overall favorite just delicious  we gave three stars because all of the meat was fantasticfresh and awesome but we were disappointed in just a few things which took the score down   1 it was overly warm in the restaurant as though the air wasnt on and no ice was offered for our waters  after a baseball game and walking to the restaurant it wouldve been nice to walk into a cool place  2 we all had ice cream and felt it was subpar mainly because it was melting so fast i ordered the sweet sweet bacon shake and was disappointed when it arrived with no bacon  no explanation 10 minutes after the shake arrived i was told they were out of the baconmy whole reason for ordering the shake the shake had a great flavor but im sure it wouldve been more awesome with the bacon  3  the fries were below standard when you pay 12 dollars for a burger you expect great fries to accompany that burger the many dipping sauces were fine but these fries were obviously frozen not terrible but frozen fresh cut fries to go with the extremely fresh burger wouldve been betterthe line is way too long here and the pancakes are overrated the pancakes are okay but you then have to wait inside for food too i got the blueberry stuff but its just a pancake i think going to dennys or ihops is preobbaly just the same mankind of a mixed bag pretty pricey the guac made table side quite good  some of the apps were pretty tasty our main courses were a bit disappointing overcooked meat too much sauce that wasnt appetizing chunky cheese accompaniment they need to up the freshness and flavor less salt more quality ingredients attention to detailsolid three stars  got a very good pourover and then decided for the vacuum pot experience right  and then the debating of technique started up among the working and notworkingbecauseitsmydayoff peeps present  ive had vacuum pot coffee in various places around the us that offer it and this method was unique  intelligentsia has a couple of videos on the subject guys  just sayin  still the fresh roast coffee and warmth of the place and earnestness of the staff make up for most shortcomings and ill gladly return to buy beans and see whats coming upyummy cold brew coffee  friendly staff however prices are on the steep side and there is no ac on a moderately warm day of 70 i was starting to sweat in the couple minutes it took to get my drinks i felt awful for the staff who have to stay in that sweatshop for hours management needs to stop being so cheap and actually turn on the acthe food is good but when i make a takeout order and im told 15 mins and then wait for 30 mins unacceptablei go here at least twice a week or once any other week very polite depends on whos working  most of the time the staff is very standoffish doesnt come over to check on table to see if we need anything lady checked my 20 dollar bill to see if it was real  even tho she knows my dad and i are regularsi have been here a few times this year and have had a great experience  last nightnot so much started with the ricotta chz empanadas  based on another review that raved about them i decided to try  they came out golden and crispy on the exterior  i broke one open and the smell of mold hit me in the face  i tasted one to make sure my assumption was correct  i told the waitress and she gave me the excuse that that is the way they are supposed to smell and taste bc the ricotta chz they use is not american  wtf  the waitress took the barely touched app away  i get the bill and they are still on the check  i called her over to ask to have them removed and she saysthe owner says you ate them  now im a straight up personif i ate em i will pay for it  she delivers the newly edited check back to me with an attitude  that will affect your tip chica on the plus side the chuleta nortena pork chop was juicy and flavorful  accompanied by the slightly sweet and creamy sweet potato  the chipotletamarind sauce gave the thick cut chop a sweet and slightly spicy accent  a must havethe typical coffee house coffee pastries and such staff was ok somewhat unprofessional in that they stood behind the counter talking loudly to each other about things not related to work or the task at hand i ordered a frozen coffee what they call a mochasippi and a bagel overall a decent experience nothing wrong   just so anyone who may visit here knows parking at this location is terrible there are a total of approximately 12 spaces and 2 of those are handicapped be prepared to hunt around or use the drive thruthey need to use ube ice cream on their halo halo and not vanilla  they need to use fresh tapioca to use in their sago  gulaman because those hard balls were disgusting in my drink it should be soft and not oldbagels are okay a bit expensive but the sandwiches choices are really good sure wish they had gluten freeice creamery outside of the cobb theatres at countryside  im giving this a 3 because the girl who tended sarah us was good but she was left to flounder due to poor scheduling she was in the weeds i felt bad for her   the ice cream was good especially when she blended in the toppings i requested but there was a line building up and there was only one girl a new menu and she was new there she kept her cool and di just fine with usto my knowledge cosis sandwiches are all preprepared  so i never go in there expecting to be blown away their food is edible and thats pretty much it  i like to go to cosi for lunch and sit outside and catch a breeze its a perfect spot for kicking it with friends or as a neutral meeting place for business acquaintances   i like the tomato soup and the chicken tbm sandwich the hot apple cider the hot chocolate and teaspretty solid tourist trap type restaurant on the docks a little bit overpriced for the food quality but reasonable given the touristy surroundingswe came here because wed heard they had great desserts but that was not our experience our entrees were quite good i had the lemon chicken with asparagus that was very tasty though a tad oversalted  my husband enjoyed his burger but he had to ask the waiter to bring the wine hed ordered after wed already started eating the desserts were so disappointing i got the crack pie which was supposed to be ooey gooey butter cake in a pie crust which was just sweet there were no other discernible flavors the butter wasnt even detectable  my husbands key lime pie was better but still disappointingi really do like this shop rite  the prices and hours are great and the service is generally decent  the deli has usually has a special which is a nice surprise everytime like turkey for 399lb and i always get samples of meats and cheeses to snack on while i wait for my order  the bakery is usually wellstocked although the donut selection is not as fantastic as giants they do have the essentials though  the store itself isnt the most wellorganized but it has everything at relatively low prices  plus if you shop on a sunday morning they have complimentary coffee danishes bagels and cookies which is a really nice gesture i think  ive also noticed that service has gotten a lot better over the years  they also have an entire aisle dedicated to mexican groceries too which most other surrounding groceries stores dont haveso the ice cream here is really great the service on the ice cream side is always excellent and they are very kind to the baby i typically bring in   the food side however is fairly lackluster service is fine and its an alright place to stop in for a quick lunch however nothing to write home about the burgers are alright the fries are pretty good the salads are okay   i am giving it a three for the ice cream that keeps this boat floating if the food matched the ice cream this would be a great spotthere are defiantely certain times of the day i will not frequent certain fast food places this rallys lunch is usually pretty solid i really like the wings and fries sometimes the buns can be stale and the meat overcooked all and all not to bad for a fast food placeexcellent customer service one of the few places in the airport outside of the gates that serves alcohol i didnt try the food drinks highly overpriced but you really have no other choicethis starbucks location is usually crowded and the crowds usually mean youre in for a long wait unfortunately the drinks come out a little bit more slowly here and its tough to get a table the layout works well but the place is small so theres not a lot of seating  what i can say though is that i am usually waited on with a smile and a nice how are you today which makes the waiting suck a little less nice staff long waits adds up to an aok in my bookbeen twice  once by myself on a sunny satruday late morning  sat outside with no wait and had a great salad  went with a party of four on a saturday night in february  were told there would be a 30 minue wait  sure no problem  found seats at the bar got a drink and  waited for an hour and a half  but it was too cold venture outside needlessly so we waited and were finally seated in the upstairs dining area which we were initially happy about because it seemed quieter than downstairs and there were only 3 other parties up there  until they turned up the music so loud we literally could not hear each other  or the waiter  we politely asked him to turn the music down and after giving us a sourpuss look he turned down the music just a smidge like a surly teen who cant believe his parents are asking him to turn down his ohsorockin tunes  other than that the food was great though no fish  chips on the menu  wah and the service was also very good i think the waiter realized he had been a bit of a jerk and tried to make it up to us  in general this seems more like a local young slightly hipster hang out bar than somewhere you would make a special trip to visit so if youre local and in your twenties i say go for iti have been to this mcdonalds countless times usually on a busy morning where i need an egg mcmuffin  i honestly only eat at mcdonalds less than once per month maybe once every other month because i dont love the food  its junk fast food though the egg mcmuffin is actually a fairly dietfriendly option for fast food  anyways i have zero complaints about this restaurant  the food is standard mcdonalds fare  the reason i felt compelled to write a review for a mcdonalds is the outstanding morninglunchtime drivethru crew  there is one employee in particular the one who usually hands you your food who is always cheerful helpful and smiling  in fact i have called mcdonalds to tell them about this employee and let them know how efficiently the drivethru is during my busy weekday mornings and occasional lunches  ive never had an issue in the past few years  i hope mcdonalds knows what a gem that lady at the drivethru isi just realized that if you goto the store on a saturday morning you do have slightly better selection in the fresh produce but hurry they go fast there seem to be better crowd families and the seafood section seems to be alive now keeping fingers crossed that it survivesmy beau and i stopped here after a movie in cool springs on a saturday night pretty much every restaurant in the area is packed at this place the wait was 7590 minutes since wed already tried a couple other places near the theatre we shrugged our shoulders and decided to wait luckily for us we found a twotop in the bar area and were able to sit about 10 minutes after walking in in hindsight im glad we got that spot cause if wed waited 15 hours for a table we would have been disappointed   the service was good our waitress was very attentive and friendly we ordered pretzel bread with cheese for an appetizer my husband got shrimp tacos and i ordered the asian chicken salad for drinks i had the lager and beau had a black and tan the beer was okay weve been to several breweryrestaurants and these werent the best beers in terms of the food our mains came out before the app but when i reminded the waitress the pretzels came out quickly beau said his tacos were pretty good my chicken salad was decent but i didnt realize that the salad had a creamy dressing and a soysauce based glaze it felt like i was eating a giant bowl of cole slaw with soy dressing and fried wontons on top the pretzels were pretty good but the cheese sauce left something to be desired im a pretzel connoisseur so i dont take this lightly wink wink i prefer cheese sauces that have some beer flavor in them this sauce was pretty tasteless and just had some salsa veggies on top   would we go back yeah maybe for that price range and atmosphere we would probably go to j alexanders or brick tops if we came back it would be for the service and to try some different dishes and id get a cosmo instead if beerthe staff was friendly and the service was fast but the food was mediocre at best i ordered a simple double whopper combo the fries were cold and stale the edges of the bun were hard and the vegetables on the burger were warm and wilted like the burger had been under a heat lamp overall it wasnt totally inedible but i definitely expect more for a fast food place that charges almost 10 for a combo meali like food trucks   i like food trucks that have poutine   i may just be a little biased here but alas i have found poutine in new orleans   for those of you who dont know what poutine is its actually a canadian dish originating in quebec  it is composed of fries with cheese curds that are sprinkled on top and they melt into a gooey mess as brown gravy is poured onto it  its a heart attack in a cup  back home in canada they have a a lot of different variations of poutines and there are specialty poutine shops i often think about poutine so i was especially excited when i saw it on foodie calls menu as they were setting up  i was so excited i couldnt wait and i ordered it immediately i had to wait about 20 minutes for the poutine because they hadnt even started up their burners yet  although it didnt taste like home the poutine was still good in its own new orleans way  a little bit of seasoned fries gravy with debris and cheese curds  cheese curds werent quite melted into a gooey mess they were still sort of square and not totally soft  plus side i know where i can poutine for my cravings i just have to chase this truck down and now i also know where i can get cheese curds in this city  as we all know the grocery stores dont carry themnot bad not so spectacular either a local version of panera bread and slightly better salads are good a few east coast sandwichesended up here on a friday just as a walk in  we were able to get seated immediately which isnt easy for media but were brought into this tiny room in the basement with no windows and so full of tables they have to be breaking a fire code  the food was really good but we couldnt really have a conversation because the sound from the 16 other people shoved into the 10 by 10 cement room was so loud    id definitely go back because all four of us had outstanding meals but insist on not sitting in that room of lost souls or just people without reservationsdecided to give this place a try after i was craving a good cuban my goto cuban spot is big steins down the road but wanted to try something new they definitely have a lot of options and is a a very cute restaurant i got the lunch special which was the hot honey turkey wrap pressed i was kind of confused when my bill came out to 10 when the lunch special was 699 but im assuming thats because i got the soup as my side the soup by the way was cold its just an assumption that my soup would be hot because well its soup so that was disappointing i will give this place another try for breakfast  seemed like they had a lot of good options and its served all day my wrap was good but didnt have enough turkeythe ambience is nice and there are several small touches making the service nice  i had the veggie quesadilla with zucchini and it was good  not super flavorful  but still good the salsa is tasty   the beans delivered with the meal in one little bowl to a booth of 6 people is strange and no one even touched them  either deliver with the chips and salsa and more than one bowl for booth of 6 easier logistics to share or skipa gaybourhood institution used to be a lot more fun now rather tired    the food is rather decent though a pit pricey  i do like that one can order a salad with a burger rather than fries  the guacamole is an embarrassment but as a whole everything is ok  its the server that will make or break the experience  there is this one chap that has been there for ages and i reckon its because he gives the guys who frequent the place something to salivate over  i for one am more impressed with my servers work ethic than looks    one one occasion i asked for more napkins didnt get them another time needed an extra fork not happening either  never got a refill on iced tea  i once had to even ask the other server for the check because apparently he didnt feel like getting that for us either    if you get any other server youll have a decent experience as none of the others have as much tude   still there are better places out therereasonably priced laid back easy i prefer my tacos with corn tortillas so really these are burritos with flour tortillas if you wanna get technical  good sangria loved the buffalo chicken taco innards nice peopleits okay we went on a busy saturday night and while the place was busy it wasnt packed solid  the food was bland and my dish was dry as a bone not even a sauce to help things  the only saving grace was the beer  i would give it another try next year when we come back but only if we run out of other places to goi loved my server she was very good this place has a nice atmosphere love the decorations and the bathroom is adorable the meal was my least favorite part my turkey sandwhich came with fresh avocade which was good but with light sourdough what exactly is light sourdough bread it takes like white bread the side salad was iceburg lettuce which has no nutrition but i did enjoy the dressing last a terrible cookie that tastes as though it was made with splenda i would probably come back here for the pastries or breakfast but not for lunchstopped in for a late lunch had been to the mass ave location but had not tried this one yet  sat at the bar bartender was eating her lunch at the bar by the cash register poor form  started out with the onion rings which i thought would be a smaller portion but they were huge and really really good  id go back for those alone  i had a few boxed the rest and ordered the meatloaf sandwich from the house specialties portion of the menu  what came out was the most confusing quasisandwich ive ever encountered  a rather large piece of meatloaf which had been griddled and slightly burned placed on top of a one long piece of texas toast served with a side of brown gravy apple slices  and cole slaw  one piece of bread not two clearly going for the open faced sandwich riff here and lettuce tomato and red onion were placed alongside  i sat there for a few minutes wondering exactly what to do with this sandwich  do i cut it in half and slap it together no way too big for that  this confusion would have been acceptable had the sandwich tasted well like anything  the meatloaf was devoid of any flavor and so was the brown gravy  two key components of this sandwich completely flavorless  the bread was ok but at that point rather insignificant  i attempted to put the tomato and onions on top for a flavor infusion but somehow that made things taste worse  pretty disappointing  the apple slices served alongside were so soggy they bent when you picked them up  the coleslaw was ok but not really my cup of tea  i have no doubt that chatham tap has some solid food on their menu the onion rings bear that out but avoid the meatloaf sandwich three stars for the onion rings 0 for the restwhen we checked out perennial it was not at full functionality they were only rolling with 3 beers some billy goat chips and cheese curds   the beer was tasty and so were the staff i am looking forward to returning in the future when they are running at an optimal level very cool spaceoverall this wasnt a bad experience  we were greeted promptly and sat promptlyhowever we were sat at a table that hardly fit our food and there was only 2 of us  the main courses were brought out right after our appetizer more to come on that and did not leave any room on the table for all of the food    the appetizer was highly praised by our server michael who by the way is an excellent salesman  he claimed it was the best queso dip that hes ever had and its not runny by any means  well it wasnt runnyit was like one greasy block of cheese all stuck together in the dishyou pretty much had to cut it into pieces and place it on the chip or in the tortilla that they give    the main dishes were good  i had the chicken street tacosthey seemed pretty authentic and there was plenty of food  my wife had the chicken quesadilla which seemed a bit greasy but she ate most of it    this place was nice to try but i probably wouldnt go back just didnt seem like our thingusually pretty empty  easy to get in and out of  not a ton of pumps but its a small town gas station so you shouldnt be expecting a ton of them  its a solid place to fill up  mini mart selection is small and the people working there arent the friendliest but what can you expectnormally this is our favorite restaurant  this time service wasnt great took way too long for our entrees seen another table right next to us get up and leave pissed not much to brag about this time took forever to get a second beer very disappointed all the way aroundwe came in on raceday so im wondering if they just really werent expecting too much business we got cuban sandwiches rice pastalitos they were out of chicken and fried plantains the owner and staff were all really friendly and i like the location and atmosphere but stopped there the bread was obviously stale to begin with on the sandwiches and the pastalitos were both cold the meat wasnt warm at all just disappointing that we spent 30 for what seemed like leftovers from the day before and im still craving cuban foodupdate  i am giving them a star back because it appears the owner keeps up with yelp comments and genuinely cares about reviews and customer satisfaction this has impressed me enough to go back for another try plus a craving for truffle fries that will not go away hopefully after my next visit i will be able to bump it up another star or two  500 i will see you soon fellow yelpers i will keep you postedour recent visit to this was our second time since our first visit was uneventful and not very good  we decided to try it again and while the service has improved dramatically i feel the menu is not very exciting  too much like all the other mediocre restaurants  the siena advertises a french chef and exciting food  what is exciting about prime rib  i would like to see more french versions of their food  how about filet mignon rossini style  how about a genuine french onion soup  what about potato gratin rather than french fries what about some great french sauces  beurre blanc provencale etc i would love to see a menu that no one else can compete with in reno  that is not the case at da vincis  everything was okay but the only thing that was excellent was the serviceeh  we came we ate we paid a lot for average fare  exceptional was the service forgettable was the meal obviously a popular place as it was packed  huge margarita selection   it would be fair to describe forgettable with regards to the meal for example i had the mixtos tacos i found the mixtos to be bland the cheese to be rubbery the rice and beans to be bland as well honestly the salsa was the most flavorful part of our mealthe breakfast burrito was tasty but not real impressed with the sticky bun they warmed in the microwave and they got hard not impressed  overall nahglorified staryucksdecent food for wendys  the sweet tea was far far far too sweet even by southern standards  i threw 80 of it away  also the above reviewer is wrong  there are tons of options around the area which are both tastier and healthier than wendys around the vanderbilt university medical center  most run in the 8 to 10 range  in the potentially tastier category  1 sam and zoes this one is a hidden gem and just across the street  it gets amazing reviews 2 calypso cafe this one gets great reviews too and its just down the road 3 chains like applebees and logansi had a hankering for fried food this afternoon and lowandbehold there was chubbies drive thru beckoning to me    ive been through a few times and it never fails to deliver large quantities of deep fried goodness  the chicken is great  the shrimp and fish is all you can hope for  the fries completely suck  greasy mushy and just gross    they had a gumbo special today which my threeyearold ordered and i ate which was really good  very smoky flavor with chicken and sausage over rice    they tend to be slow as they make the food to order but worth the wait as theres absolutely no other option in this part of townbubble tea is one of my many vices its delicious and ill never turn down the opportunity for a honeydew bubble tea with tapioca and lychee pieces so great anyways a friend and i came here for our bubble tea fix and it was a pretty decent experience id come back but it wasnt anything extraordinary   it was busy in there like every single table was full type busy people playing games eating food drinking tea the whole thing that being said it was also quite loud but thats what you expect when a place is this popular id like to come back and sit and enjoy myself since i only stayed in there for about 10 minutes   i got a honeydew bubble tea and it was good i also ordered the spring rolls and they were actually really good as well the price is decent for what you pay for and they have special deals on different days of the week so on tuesdays you get cheap green onion cakes if you buy a bubble tea on wednesdays you get cheap spring rolls etc etc you get the idea   the menu is huge and there are tons of options for bubble tea you can also get iced teas shaved ice hot tea there is an endless amount of options really i was also surprised at the amount of food they had on the menu as well also you can get a stamp card here when you buy nine bubble tea you get the tenth for free which is great for addicts like myself   lots of parking in the parking lot even though it may get quite busy depending on the time you go there are quite a few other shops in the complex which probably contributes to the craziness if you dont want to bother with the crazy parking lot theres an abundance of street parking close by   the service wasnt that great when i went the girls at the till werent that friendly but i wasnt super bothered by it since they were so incredibly busy it took a while for my spring rolls and i went up to the counter to ask for them and they were sitting behind the counter not being called out the girl was kind of snippy about it but i didnt really care since i just wanted my food   overall not bad was worth the visit because the bubble tea was delicious and ill probably come back some other time maybe to enjoy a bigger dish or a game i take experiences like this as a grain of salt hopefully i come next time and theyre friendlier if not i know i can always leave with a delicious drink that i came forthey really arent kidding when they tell you that their seaweed salad is different its different and not in a positive way it tastes as if it was soaking alongside fish it tastes worse than seawater it tastes like fishy water if you like your seaweed i assure you that you wont like this version  other than that the beef negimaki is tasty but the sushi sashimi wasnt anything to brag about ive had better sushi elsewherethis is more like a 25 star review my recent experience was pretty meh  i used to love this place when i lived down the street i hadnt been in for a long time and stopped in for a quick bite and glass of wine around happy hour time i ordered a glass of wine which was like 10 not having a happy hour wine is really annoying although they do offer a 20 bottle adding some glasses of wine to the happy hour menu would be cool   i ordered the pretzel with cheese the pretzel was hard as a rock so hard in fact that i couldnt cut it with a steak knife i only ate about half because i was starving it was 5pm and i hadnt eaten all day strangely enough i feel like more than one employee saw me struggling to cut the damn pretzel and no one asked me if everything was ok strange i could have broken a window with that pretzel or a tooth  either way it was a disappointing visit to a place i once lovedi had a very good breakfast here it was the deluxe scramble which comes with your choice of ingredients it took a while for the food to come but it was worth the wait i am happy that they are using the building well i will definitely be returning to try other menu itemsthe kind maitre d greeted me at the door and found me a seat at one of the few tables in this small caf  it was so small that he had to use my table for pitchers of water and tubs of dishes as he cleared other tables  but he was really nice about it  i recommend the fleurdelis omeletgreen peppers onion provolone and bits of sausage covered with a mildly spicy red sauce and crawfish  this came with wholegrain toast and fried hash browns  the bloody marys with baconinfused vodka and full strips of bacon swizzle sticks looked amazingit was just too early for me to indulgeyummy food and a local spot that is centrally located with outdoor seating folks from all over come to fradys they have a menu that changes of hot food and will make you some fresh eggs and bacon as a morning meal if you like   a small local shop as well that sells sodas bread and other needs not exactly a supermarket but will get you that salt or coffee you need at the last minute   super friendly staff and an overall nice spot to know about in the area when you get tired of the other spots in the area which could happen fairly quickly if you eat at the same spots every daythis is the closest where i live but i am not here that often the pizza is ok not terrible but  even one of the 4 star reviews mention there are better pizza joints in philly  so if i dont feel like getting in my car to drive there and walking over ill come over here not to mention they are open way late so if other pizza joints are closed ill come here   i met the owners who are nice people and i never had a bad experience with the service and sometimes there are lunch specials for 2 slices and a soda  but the biggest  problem is there are many pizza joints in philly its a competitive market and if there are better slices out there i am going to go therei thought the yogurt was great with tons of toppings to choose from  you can go healthy or go crazy with all of the choices  seating is very limited but service was great i will be backthe smoothies are ok every time i get one they have some chunks of frozen fruit in itwhich is annoying its just an ok place nothing fantasticeverything was good eating on the end of the wharf is great of course staff is cool i could give another star if the food was exceptional the steamed mussels were really good although the broth lacked some oomph the clam chowder was ok loaded with a lot of herbs which wasnt my style king crab legs was probably a bad choice on my part should have ordered local catchnot bad  first time here  mac and cheese doesnt have much flavour  could be an off day  cornbread is good  brisket a tad chewy doesnt quite have that break on bend i like    its an ok jointobviously its starbucks and obviously their products are the same everywhere so i wont say anything about what they have rather how they have it  ive been here about a million times its close to school and my department frequents this location  i give three stars because it seems that there is almost always a line  on occasion i have waited longer than felt necessary for a drink and i have been there at least three times when they were out of vanilla syrup  how the heck does starbucks run out of vanilla syrup  anyways  they have a great outdoor seating section one of the best in my opinion and the workers are normally very nicethe atmosphere and the service both get 5 stars  i have dined here twice and both times i have had young friendly efficient servers a huge change from the toocoolforschool hipsters that the depots competition employs  the atmosphere is also excellent with bright airy spaces that have been artfully restored to their former glory my only complaint is that the chairs are really uncomfortable maybe they do that so that you dont sit around and drink forever  the music is awesome an great blend of modern and postmodern alternative  unfortunately the food is at best two stars the menu is not to my taste on my visits i sampled the pepper appetizer clams the sausage and pepper sandwich with house salad and burger  everything was just average average and pricey  for 14 for a burger i want it to be awesome it was bland  anyways i want to give the depot a higher rating but i just didnt love itnormally this is my favorite place in town for a nice dinner they still are a great place to go for brunchdrinksapps or sandwichburger however recently they have really downgraded the quality of their steak and salmon atleast what they put on their salads and it is very disappointing i was hoping it was just one bad batch but it has happened on more than 1 occasion recently and i have friends that have noticed the same decline in quality dont get greedy depot everybody loves it here so just keep buying the quality ingredients you always have  ill echo the numerous reviews here that seem to agree that the food is pretty good if you can stomach the terrible service youre likely to get  i think the ny style of taking a pie thats been sitting outside all day and reheating it upon order is disgusting so ill never order by the slice however their fresh pizza is great and i love the chicken parmesan sandwich the fries are the delicious crinklecut kind and best of all they have diet mountain dew on the fountain with flavor shots  get a cherry shot in it  but several times weve gone there theyve been busy and depressingly understaffed amber was our waitress two times recently and should definitely consider employment in a different industry 5 minutes to get acknowledged at the hostess stand which employs no hostess  and servers dread going near apparently another 10 minutes once seated to get waited on  after putting in our drink order it took no exaggeration over 10 more minutes for her to get our drinks we fortunately put in the food order when we ordered drinks why not we had enough time to look at the entire menu and 45 minutes later when the food arrived i was told another server took my sandwich and mine would come later my three tablemates finished their food before i got mine with no apology whatsoever again the food was delicious but then it took another 15 minutes to get cashed out a 75 minute experience for what amounted to be pizza and sandwiches i wont blame the kitchen because they were busy but the service is reliably terrible  if youve got time to spare or it doesnt look busy i do recommend precinct pizzas delicious food but always be ready to sit there way longer than you wanted to with little to no attention paid to you by the staff four stars for the food one star for the service but ill generously round up to 3 stars overallthe food is not anything special  what sets this place apart is its prime spot right there on the beach right next to the round about  the pier  go there when its not too hot out perhaps after sunset and sit outside  its pretty relaxing yet in the center of the action tooeverything about this was just alright the burger was meh not flavorful mac and cheese was fine in a mediocre fine kinda way not a good fine kinda way green beans were just okay i probably wont try this againnormally i love this store today not so much and not for the past few months i called to ask if they have fresh terragon bc im having a bernaise emergency and first theres no answer in any dept then i get an answer im placed on hold then im hung up on and im sure this is intentional bc no one wants to go look hello whole foods im giving you my businesspretty darn good happy hour specials going on here  had an lit which i hadnt had in years 2 for 1 5 and 3 appetizers  we drank  ate like crazy and our bill was less than 20    i am not cheap but the apps were pretty good  drinks werent weak    went back a 2nd time for dinner    short rib mac n chez  omg delishonce again st louis has spoiled me the whole foods right outside of stl brentwood had got me excited about whole foods once more first with graeters and secondly and more often once graeters appeared more places with their outstanding togo sandwiches and pastry selection  this location however lacks an impressive or even good pastry section their pastry case is all of two or three feet long the one in st louis probably four times that length   where were the cream puffs the non mini tarts or any fruit tarts besides mixed berry where were the french inspired pastries or the vegan ones where was any of this  instead there were pudding cups i bought one  it was very pretty and did use very rich chocolate but was still just a bit better than a normal pudding cup creme brulee two types of macaron flavors and only a few cakes albeit i am sure you can call in advance to order others as you can at most whole foods there were mini tarts but all the same mixed berry flavors there was no layered deserts or tiramisu  it was just a below average bakery selection and it left me sad as i had driven there hungry and wanting pastries  maybe the other location in indy will prove more fruitful or pastry case fulli am amazed that this place has as many as 45 stars  sure their food is good enough to eat but its nothing too unique  ive never had a greek salad without olives  theirs has none but the amazing dressing is the saving grace  traditional gyro meat should be made with lamb  theirs is not but getting extra yummy tzatziki makes it delish  they can keep their farmed tilapia high in mercury and frozen french fries  but i will scarf down a plate of zekos wings its all in the sauces with them  overall it is a place with very friendly owners who know how to dress up their food for this i will return  they should be aware of the badmouthing their employees do though i dont even know them and ive heard things more than once  ps look at the hood this place is in and then compare that to the reviews you read unique flavors huge donuts cold brew on tap  hipster ambience district reminds me a lot of los angeles so i really wanted to love it but the donut execution was poor   like birdies in dtla the donut is a little on the dry side i appreciate that the pumpkin cheesecake donut i ordered wasnt too sweet but everything seemed off there was way too much dough compared to the amount of pumpkin cream cheese filling meh ca folks this has nothing on sidecar or blue star unfortunately   cold brew they add chicory powder was good thoughpoor service is their downfall the building is great the chicken in a biscuit is good they charge tourism prices great patiogreat foods everything is so spicy and delicious i can say i love mostly everything on the menu their karaoke system is alright the rooms are too dark but overall its not bad their spicy crawfish is very good too but the bad thing about it is they put too much legs on the bottom so you dont really get much of it overall not bad  one of my favorite restaurant in chinatownive seen complaints here about the price but i felt like my steak and frites were fairly priced  15  for lunch the steak was a good portion was very tasty and well cooked  i liked the onion and butter on it too made it yummy and  special a nod by the chef that  even thought it was just steak heshe were willing to make the effort now that i know they nailed the steak i will be back for the more adventurous items on the menu the mussels were very fresh and tasty  the broth was subtle and delicious i dont like it when the broth is too garlicky or saltynot a problem  i liked the dessert a goat cheese cheesecakesweet and fluffy  if they didnt make it there it was close by at the hands of someone who knew what they were doing  i hate being served a costco cheesecake that is not fresh and overly cold from recent thawing and frankly you get that a lot in tucson  the creme brulee was very tasty too big portion with tangy blueberries and strawberries  wait staff was very good  smiled and were nice but not phony  i like staff that are engaged in their work but not too earnest or chattygood job the room was comfortable cool it was 106 outside and clean  the table was sturdy tucson restaurants why is this such a continual issue out there and the chairs substantial and cool looking   why i cant give maynards a 4 or 5 stars rating yet i think its cheap of them not to offer bread with the mussels i had to ask granted it was nice bread  the bloody mary tasted bad  it had a neato bit of asparagus but it tasted like a slim jim and was pretty weak on the liquor side of the equation  it was bad enough to send back but i chocked it down  i just wont put out 8 bucks for a cocktail here again  the frites sauce is catsup not special catsup either wineyes red wine is supposed to be room temp but that means about 65 degrees or so  i think it had maybe sat at the bar overnight and warmed a bit much serving zin that warm gives it a harsh edge and a stale feel  thank god i was having a steak with it  the choice of warm wine might be the sommeliers style  which is fine but forget about me agreeing by buying more  i will go back and order something more challenging food wise  to be on the safe side i will have a simpler cocktail and enjoy a beer with my foodthe service was good i had the lettuce wedge and not sure what size the head of lettuce was but was the smallest lettuce wedge i have every seenordered all the other food that our family ordered was fabulous and good size portions we also had the flights of beer i may have left a little hungry still but everyone else had happy bellys little price but was goodjust avoid the lettuce wedge if you actually want to eat or are hungrygood pancakes but theyre just that pancakes in my opinion it doesnt justify the wait it does go relatively quickly  i had the country ham i think more than anything its just not for me really salty but i think its supposed to be that way my review isnt influenced by that alone  if you want to check it out as a tourist spot by all means go youll enjoy your pancakes but im not in a rush to wait so long for an averahe breakfast when theres so many amazing options aroundthe grounds are beautiful the market is beautiful and the facilities are clean we go once a year to do apple picking or pumpkin picking but because their goods are so pricey  we dont shop there at allgreat food but pricey and portions are too big you order meat loaf and you get a whole meat loaf the new 12 sandwichcup of soup special is nice but excludes the reuben option no prices shown everything a la carte but the food is tasty and service is quick expect to pay 1015 dollars for lunch though but you wont leave hungry baked goods very expensive too but quality is good always ask what things cost before orderinggreek to its core nice atmosphere full and bustling service a little harried and inconsistent  after great hummus i came to find that as i was eating my appetizers and entrees i just really dont like greek food that much not a knock on the restaurant maybe more so my taste buds  flat facethis cvs is conveniently located and pretty clean there are times ill have to go to another cvs since this one wont carry an item or has limited stock the staff is helpful but sometimes they go missing at the register and i have to hunt them down prices even for a drug store are usually on the high sidewent back to have lunch here the other day and was nicely surprised that we could order very tasty breakfast dishes  the shakshuka eggs braised in tomato and pepper stew with a strong cumin flavor were certainly a good way to start our meal the softcooked peppers making a perfect accompaniment for the runny eggs  we ordered the appetizer combination plate including wellknown meze favorites  especially good were the crisply fried fava falafal balls other meze were quite ordinary like the lackluster tzatziki  not at all to our liking were the mushy bland dolmades stuffed grape leaves  the grilled pork was correctly done served with a small salad  i was glad to see a pretty good lunch crowd the lunch prices after all are very good  looking at the dinner menu including goat stew and rabbit i imagined the food to be more focused and also more original in the evening while the lunch choices did not surpass average including the desserts of galaktobureko with tired phyllo and a pudding with lots of rose water  the service is knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere of the restaurant bright and invitingsoda fountain square is closed as a restaurant space and is now an event space through sqwiresthe menu is great but unfortunately they are inconsistent with food prep ive had great food then cold food then undercooked food all for the exact same dishwe wanted to love this place it is very cool looking the food smelled great but the service really needs work i say that the food smelled great because we actually never got ours had to flag down a waiter just to get water then finally got our bar and food order in only to have our waiter disappear and never return  we  sat there nearly an hour with only water and could not get anyone to help us so we decided to call it a night and head to another favorite st charles restaurant  to be fair the place was super busy but it wont stay that way if the service is bad  seems like it could be a fun placewas really disappointed when i received my tofu provenale this last time  both the potatoes and tofu came out incredibly dryno olive oil to be found on the plate  their provenale had previously been a blend of olive oil herbs tomatoes and garlic sauted to perfection  ive always asked for this dish without onions  today the olive oil with herbs de provence garlic etc was completely missing  the waitress told me she had no idea why they did that  it was just dry fried tofu with a bit of tomato and herbs i was so disappointed that this excellent dish had been botched  she took it back and returned with what tasted like a lesser olive oil and nearly raw garlic added to my existing plate  i guess i wont be returning which is too bad because i adored that dishthis place is good its not great service is fast efficient and friendly for sure but the overall experience is lackingsomething but i cant place it i ordered a cheeseburger medrare with truffle fries and a black  white milkshake since all of these combined is pretty much my favorite thing i ever i was more than willing to hand over the 12 for the opportunity okay now the food  1 the burger its not like the burger isnt good because it is its just noti find myself saying five guys i admit i dont have the most refined of palettes so take that with a grain of salt it came out more medium than medium rare and its somewhat small i can tell that its quality meat but i like my burgers juicy and this one just isnt quite the bun is also a huge factor for me in a burger and i just dont like this style id dock good dog for the same reason love the meat but the bun just doesnt cut it for me   2 the truffle fries omfg the best part of the meal the fries are amazing id probably just pop in and buy them on their own and at this price i dont see myself ordering truffle fries from any other establishment ever again  3 the milkshake boy do i love me a black  white this one was just too chocolatey for my liking it tasted much more like just a regular chocolate milkshake which in and of itself isnt such a bad thing except for when what you really want is the holy blended harmony of rich heavy chocolate and light as air and sweet as pie vanilla   all in all the proximity to my workplace and the fact that it is well actually good belies that there will surely be more 500 degrees in my future i might tweak a few things like ordering the burger rare and can you get extra cheese  i wouldnt be surprised to see this spot updated even before the next work week is outthe sole reason this review is 3 stars instead of 2 is because of jessica wish i could give 35 dinner on a sunday night at 420 pm took 90 minutes we sat at the bar ordered the vermont breakfast  american burgers our medium  medium rare burgers were both medium well   my husband was so hungry he didnt want to send it back and wait all over again burgers were still ok  had great flavors we waited almost 30 minutes for milkshakes jessica was amazing handling a busy bar counter she saw that our wait was long  went above and beyond to make our shakes herself shakes were tasty jessica was personable  attentive to every customer at the bar as well will probably return but not anytime soongood farm to table option when you are trying to stay healthy hard to do when you eat out i had their classic no bun and added a fried egg had sauted spinach as my side will be back for suretoday was my first time visiting a red robin i had heard many good things about them from friends and family and decided to take my brother out for an early birthday lunch and a movie the restaurant appeared very clean and service was friendly and professional with just one tiny lapse the burgers were great and i was happy with the fact that the waitress didnt bat an eye when i ordered mine medium rare i have had restaurants tell me they wont serve burgers below medium and that just tells me that they dont trust the quality of their meat or kitchen staff the fries were a bit of a disappointment though my brother had bragged about how good they were and since we were in shortly after opening at 11 am i expected them to be hot and fresh while they werent horrible they werent very warm and several of mine were very hard like they had been left to either cook too long or sat under a heat lamp for far too long again they werent horrible it just seemed strange for them not to be fresh so early in the day all in all i would happily go back again  my one issue is something that is common to a lot of restaurants i am a big guy at 61 and around 315 lbs many restaurants red robin included have booths with their tables firmly mounted to the floor as a hostess if you have a larger customer coming in it might behoove you to consider seating your diner somewhere where they can be comfortable the restaurant was sparsely populated and there were regular tables and chairs high top tables and even bar seating that would have been far more comfortable for me rather than having me try and squeeze into a booth yes i know that the simple answer is lose weight but that doesnt change the fact that you should always try and make your customer comfortablei miss going to this place ever since i left missouri the place is not very authentic but its cheap and it fills you up the pink lemonade is off the chart and we used to hang out here with my two younger brothersthis place seems to have worked out most of the kinks that plagued their opening such as closing in the middle of lunch prime time because they ran out of meat  now months later i finally made another visit due to an extreme burger craving  the burger definitely hit the spot but the experience was almost ruined by the fries  not sure why im reading so many rave reviews for the truffle fries because mine were so greasy and salty that i needed my milkshake constantly  i still ate the fries mind you but i feel i may regret it later  i was trying to give them their due because of the rave about them and id never had truffle fries before but the salt and oil made it too hard to distinguish any significant difference from regular fries  i think the shake couldve used a bit more strawberry also because it often tasted plain with just hints of strawberry although that may have been the result of the saltyass fries  oh and 1250 plus tax for a cheddar cheeseburger truffle fries and a shake  i dunno its really just a step above typical fast food maybe two steps actually so the price is about right for the location   while im not an aficionado i do get the occasional craving and have had my share of good burgers  i didnt expect it to be as pink as it was inside when i ordered medium but it was juicy and tasty  i may go back to give them another chance to get the fries right but the burger was on point  the portions were just right too  just the right amount of fries over a quarter pound of meat and a good size shake maybe 16oz  if you dont get the combo the burger alone might be a bit underwhelming at glance but i think american portions are too big anyways generally  im 6 feet tall 190lbs and i was full after the combo without getting the itis bottom line  a decent burger jointthe braised pork bowl came with a pretty pitiful amount of pork but it did taste pretty good had a taiwan beer for 350 which is pretty coolfirst visit for me to the dk house and the first time in 18 years for my wife  first impression of the grounds  they badly need landscaping upgrades and improvements  the buildingporch roof badly needs attention  once inside the dining areas are nicely appointed albeit needing a little tlc  the main dining room has 78 tables and it can be very difficult to have a quiet dinner over the discussions of the other diners  in hindsight we should have asked to be seated in the smaller dining room with the fireplace  our appetizers were very good and fresh  shrimp cocktail for me and the shrimplobster bisque for my wife  for dinner i had the ny strip and my wife had the filet mignon  both of our steaks were excellent  only complaint was from my wife as her mashed potatoes were ice cold in the middle  dessert was apple streusel and raspberry tort both very good  service was excellent  it was pricey 180 including tip but wed go back  i sincerely hope that the owners invest in the property as it is an iconic chester county locationeveryone seems to be complaining about prices but i kind of disagree first off their triple berry cake is the best the fruits are fresh and the cake batter is not too sweet the small goods i must say are a little bit pricey but if you look at the details and how nice it looks you get what you pay for the ice cream is amazing birthday cake would be my personal fave kitchen sink is the big talk of the place but i havent come around to trying   i come here from time to time for their breakfast if im tired of my regular pho fix lol my boyfriend  i came in two weeks ago and decided to sit outside under the umbrella with new orleans bipolar weather soon enough mister sun didnt shine and the july showers came down on us the waiter was inside and didnt come outside to assure us if we wanted to move so we closed our own umbrella and went inside hoping we bumped into the waiter to let him know he refilled our drink and apologized for the inconvenience i ordered the best banker croissant and my boyfriend had the 222 the best banker tasted better than i expected but my boyfriends 222 was small proportioned when our food arrived my waiter again was no where to be seen when i realized we didnt have our utensils so i actually got up and got it myself overall food was good  worth the price better service next time pleasedidnt think it was worth the huge line that formed outside the place while we ate  eggs ordinary bacon actually very dry and crispy blueberry pancakes not that extraordinary  all in all id come back but if there was the huge line outside id recommend to find someplace else because even though the servers are prompt and efficient the whole experience was very sorry to say but in my humble opinion not memorablei found the food here decent but the headache of weaving through the everexpansive line stretching out the front door is not quite worth the heady taco experience   the main issue lies within the compact entrance which leaves little to no room for people to migrate into a manageable clump instead we piled up like herded sheep around the register then piled out the front door luckily it was a mildly warm sunny day so most of the crowd felt rather patient however i do not recommend coming here at peak brunch hours or evening dinner hours near weekends my friends and i arrived at 1230pm saturday prime time lunch we were able to sit with a lovely individual but our food took app 45 minutes before it came out when i asked a staff member she told me they were backed up from the whole lunch crowd so definitely order an appetizer i recommend the queso if youre waiting  the outdoor seating is quite sidewalkchic if you know what i mean lots of large picnic tables and plenty of room for pets they even provide dog bowls if fido needs a drink of water the picnic tables i would say are also their greatest downfall unless youre ok with sharing room family style which we were you might prefer indoor seating or taking it togo  food wasless stellar than expected i had the korean bbq and brisket tacosthe meat was quite tender for the brisket and i found the pickled red onions added just the right amount of sourness i was disappointed by the korean bbq a decent but lackluster mixture of chopped cabbage carrots and a slightly marinated bulgogiish meat the star of my meal was the fried green chile mac n cheese absolute cholesterolinducing perfection this made the meal worth the crazy line  i would say if you havent had texmex in texas give it a shot if you have this might not be the best waiti only came into this friendlys to get a friendz basically a blizzard the restaurant was very spacious and the ice cream area was incredibly clean i used to be an ice cream girl at friendlys when i was in high school so i know what a pain it is to keep that sticky crap from getting all over the place  my friendz was delicious  ill be backfood is ok for a hospital some of the staff are nice others are rude overpriced but have a  captive audience  meaning patient families plus hardly any place nearby to eatgreat place to grab a sandwich with no waiting  pretty generous portion for turkey with cheese or roast beef  nice touches include starting with a fresh delicious roll roasted red peppers razor thin sliced onions and wellpaired cheese  for 599 and ready made you cant go wrong for the neighborhood  overall the store is nice with a lot of items if you look hard enough  they also tend to have some really good sales esp meats so have a look  fresh and reasonable produce and friendly staff toogreat cappuccino although my wet cappuccino and my husbands dry cappuccino came out exactly the same  the coffee itself had good flavor cute midtown location  it would be nice if there were better menu signs   but overall a nice cup of coffeesetting aside my expectations of a barista greeting me  being able to take my order pretty quickly im hopefully optimistic  so the shift manager was on the phone when i walked in  didnt acknowledge me one other barista is working drive thru  not tons of cars in line 1or2 but engaged looks like another barista may be coming on  okay so ill just order on the app  see what happens  two other customers came in  ordered after me manager finished the call  took an order  boom delivered next order delivered  dont see my order at pick up guess ill get off here and go check in not the best sbucks in town oh wait my name was just called  received my drink but im thinking i may have to ask for my bakery item hmm yeah the barista is helping a new customer now  the kid that just came on and is taking over the dthru seems pretty sharp shift manager is tagteaming the order for the new customer i think another customer has come in  maybe four min ago  not acknowledged until the barista was ready to take the order  man i want my bakery item  lots of gnats where im standing btw latest customer a new one doesnt look to pleased  oh just got asked if i was waiting on another mobile order  gonna get my bakery item yes  got it oh  the barista apologized for the wait thats what im taking about a little acknowledgment goes a long way ah just realize the shift manager was making a big ole fancy drink just before announcing see you after my 10 min break  ill give another star  i dont like complaining just wish i could have been greeted with a hi or hello or good afternoon maybe a well be right with you just a side note  no napkins tables are dirty im thinking this could be a fantastic sbucks wa little better management  a lot of hard work realize this is more a play by playcommentary not done many reviews thanks for letting me vent ill be back im a sucker plus maybe i could be an encouragement maybe help somehow  righttastey pastry  similar to a funnel cake the only difference is the dough folded instead of spread out only eat when freshly made and do not worry about the powdered sugar it will end up everywhereprobably a great stop for breakfast but i came for a late lunch food was good i didnt know all the variations they offer the nutella stuff looked delicious good music playing staff did a fair job but the facility wasnt very clean looked as if it had not been cleaned since the breakfast shift floors tables etc   ill be back most likely for breakfast next timequality delivered with disdain  the sushi is good and the saki selection is great but its brought to you eventually  by people that clearly have better things to do the lunch buffet is great and it minimizes your reliance on the wait staff   the atmosphere is nothing to write home about but the music the music is bumpin banal blather that limits your ability to hold a conversation without it devolving into a combination of shouting a charades that said lunch is better but once the sun sets the boombastic buffoonery beginsoutliers gets a generous 3 star rating from me but is a place i will continue to go back to when it is convenient to get a few beers i have to judge them up against the ever growing list of breweries in indy and it just seems that they fall towards the back of the pack in most categories    lets start with the beer they almost always have their 4 house beers on tap these include a brown an ipa a rye and a pilsner all of them are decent beers and worth getting but none of them are head over heels better than what you can get at most places along with those 4 are usually a few taps of either a seasonal or some brugge stuff i have had some good sourfruit beers from here and i know they do some different barrel aging as well so there are some interesting options every once in a while the issue is that these extra beers when they have them are really slow to change and they havent expanded their standard lineup in the year and a half they have been brewing it seems in my experience that it is not uncommon to see the same tap offerings for well over a month which leads to me not stopping in here as much as i would otherwise they just dont hold a flame to the variety of styles and beers that the other breweries in indy have and their lineup gets boring quickly because of it  the space is not much to get excited about either its an old warehouse with some picnic tables to sit at and some plastic tables in front of a tap trailer where you order your beer but they have gone out of their way to keep the brewing and drinking areas separate which is very disappointing i love visiting breweries that have their brewery area prominently featured in their location but you cant see much of any of their operation from the tables which makes sitting in the old space even less justifiable when there are lots and lots of breweries in indy that have a nicer setup and their whole operation is in view of the customers they pretty much just have about the bareminimum setup for people to stop in a try some beers but it looks like more of an afterthought to me and isnt a place i would choose to go sit at for an afternoon  the hours here recently got extended to be a little better than they were so now you can drink here friday from 48 saturday from 25 or sunday from 124 these hours make it obvious that they have a brewery that thrives on sales to restaurants much more than sales from their location service hasnt always been the best and often it seems like the people working here are more what you would find at a brew fest where they are just volunteers helping the company out by pouring some beers they are usually a little slow dont know much about the beer and i have on numerous occasions gotten served short pours because there is so much foam in my beer that they dont dump out or let settle they are always nice though and i assume it is hard to find someone who is a great customer service person who wants to work only a few hours on a saturday afternoon or friday evening  i like that they are another local breweries that makes some good stuff and their location close to my place is a big draw for me it will continue to be a brewery that i stop at to get some decent beers at good prices and maybe to try the occasional new offering but it seems like they have been at a standstill for a while as far as what they have to offer so my visits keep getting more and more spread out hopefully things are working out for them though and i will continue to keep an eye on their social media to seek out their new stuff when they have itgot the soy black milk tea with pearls 513 its similar to thai milk tea which was why i purchased this however when i asked the girl at the counter if it was like a thai milk tea she said it was powder not really descriptive but tried it anyway the taste was fine but 513 is a little steep for mefor the area acceptable  its the only game in town  so special treatment isnt common  dealers by the majority are not friendly  it strikes you as a 20 of the dealers make 80 of the tips scenerio i dont need a fan club  but at least pretend you dont hate your job  weve dined at every restaurant and cant say weve ever had a bad mealheart food but poor service try not to go in the afternoon during shift change one server one bartender and night bartender and barback leaned against the counter and talked instead of helping the slammed am staff you would think they would help to push the process of clearing out so that they can make money i used to love coming to baileys range when they first opened  their burgers were generous never dry and good quality  however last time we went they size of the burger drastically decreased and even though we ordered our burgers medium they were very dry  i also recall getting more of their homemade sauce but think they may give you less now  the ice cream is still as good as i remember it but i dont think we will be going back any time soon  too many other burger joints that arent nearly as expensive for what you geti got a sticky bun it was very stale not good i expected good things since it was a city bakery very disappointed  edit after my one star swiss haus reached out to me and offered me to come in and choose something on the house i appreciate that they care enough to do that though i wont be taking them up on the offer kudos to them two more starswe tried pizza mizza because my hubby saw that they offer glutenfree crust in an ad somewhere the 3 stars is for said glutenfree crust  the best ive had anywhere they lose the other 2 stars for 1 the glutenfree crust is not on their menu so you have to know to ask for it  2 the staff was pretty lukewarm didnt seem to want to be there 3 we werent told upon ordering that they charge an extra 2 for glutenfree the bill for 2 personal size pies and 2 drinks was a whopping 29 very overpriced imo but i would definitely recommend them for those who want a good pizza and dont mind the pricemy first time here and i honestly think this was the worst experience ive had at a restaurant i was really disappointed with the food i was hoping itll taste authentic but i guess they made it more americanized which is kind of understanding i ordered the papaya salad thum ma hoong for appetizer it tasted okay down side was that it was too plain for me didnt really taste like the flavor i was hoping for  the pad see ew was also so flavorless i wanted to get a taste of toastyness from the noodles lastly the desert i ordered the sweet mango sticky rice which is my favorite thai desert ever and i was really upset with this one the sticky rice was more on the soggy side than sticky side the coconut cream was just slapped on top of the sticky rice which i dont know why because its suppose to be mixed together with the sticky rice also the mango wasnt ripe it was hard  not as sweet as it should be the only thing that pleased me was the beef jerky seen hang it was really chewy  flavorful with seasoning  a side of a sweet spicy tangy sauce which made it taste 10x better although the food wasnt to my likings the service  the environment was great  soothing which was the reason for the 3 stars friendly staff but horrible foodfood 2  5 stars  the breakfast poutine 4  5 stars the real highlight of todays brunch was my friends breakfast poutine  i stole a few bites the poutine had a rich flavor and was very satisfying   the duck confit   5 stars did not try but was told that the dish tasted great   smoked salmon beni 0  5 stars although i was looking forward to my dish the smoked salmon beni was a huge disappointment not only was the salmon in small supply it tasted like overcooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised definitely not a deal with the 1200 price tag that comes along with it even though the eggs potatoes and other fixings of the dish tasted great the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking  especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant i was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish     location not a factor in the rating  prep  pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant there are a lot of places to park even if the lot is full and we only waited about 30 min on a holiday sunday at noon     service 5  5 stars  the servers were very nice and accommodating at the restaurant additionally they were thorough on ensuring that the kitchen staff was notified of my allergy to nuts     overall 35  5 stars   overall i enjoyed my experience at prep  pastry and will most likely return to try some of their other food offerings however i will be avoiding their smoked salmon beniim sad to report that it seems the quality here is slipping at first i thought it was a fluke but ive been here several times now and its definitely on the decline the flavors arent as tasty as they used to be and the texture isnt as consistent almost all have runny spots and many sputter when coming out ive tasted a few that would even be described as questionably fresh and one that was definitely bad they replaced it immediately after i brought it to their attention but still in addition their toppings have gone down in quality  taste too namely the mochi the cookie dough and the brownies not sure if this was their choice or their suppliers but its not good the paninis they promised early in the season apparently didnt pan out plus the spoons they use are not great for froyo and are even a little sharp and too deep and not ecofriendly many better ones exist its still clean but not the sparkling clean it used to be the girls who work there are personable but the really sweet manager allison who made customers feel really welcomed is no longer there  they bring in a lot of different machinedispensed frozen treats in addition to the froyo they started with old school frozen custard and added gelato and lower fatglycemic varieties and now even have italian ice the ratio of frozen yogurt to these other items seems to be getting smaller thats not necessarily bad just a heads up i actually think this is kinda cool and if they were to expand on it a bit and offer really unique highquality options like soyvegan froyo or unusual flavors maybe something spicy instead of 3 different meh vanillas and 3 different meh chocolates theyd have something really cool  worth driving farther for in fairness they do usually have a sea salt somethingorother kahlua chocolates and a bananaycaramely option but even those are pretty typical froyo finds  also they possibly used to have a sugarfree option i only suppose this because the last time i was in there several different customers asked about it but the response was that they dont have a sugarfree flavor just the lower glycemic flavors and a sugarfree chocolate sauce most customers who asked just walked out disappointed another headsup if youre in search of that  these changes arent enough to prevent me from going there at all froyos yummy but they certainly have made me less excited about it and more inclined to look for other options unfortunately there really arent many in the area i know im not the only person whos less happy with berry creamy than i used to be i hope they heed constructive feedback from loyal customers and keep a check on their quality it was one of the things that made this place so much better than the others id been to berry creamy is still highish on my list but im worried about their position in the futurethe blu fig is home to some great mediterranean grub but has an odd set up   pro blu fig is home to probably the friendliest staff of any mediterranean restaurant ive been to   pro a couple of vegetarian options available including homemade falafel   pro they have fruit tea one of my favorite things about nashville   con the overall set up and flow of the place was weird we were halfway waited on and halfway on our own you place your order at the register but then dont pay until youre done dinning   con there isnt much sitting room inside will probably be difficult during the winter months to find a spot to sit   overall though it was good enough that i would go back the falafel alone was worth the trip there obed the manager there was extremely talkative and eager to share with you how the blu fig is different than other mediterranean restaurantscupcakes looked very yummy but were just average cupcakes i was hoping they would be something more than that i could have gone to the store and bought the same quality cupcakesmost awkward drive through ever to enter and exit   no playspace for kids  efficient if you can manage to get in and out during busy traffic times  nough saidthe sushi is decent pretty basic nothing fancy the pick 2 is a great deal if you order take out add about 20 to 30 minutes to the estimated time its done because without fail its never ready when we show up to pick it upi was really hesitant to try this place because of the poor reviews it isnt oh my gosh amazing but it was good enough i would definitely go back if i was in need of a pho fix noodle city is much closer to me but they fail to cater to a vegetarian audience so i never go there   i ordered the vegetable noodle soup with tofu and it was good there were tons of noodles and vegetables so much so that i ate some at the tables outside of pho bistro and the rest at home and promptly passed out afterwards im not sure if that is a good or bad sign i also had a taro milkshake and i cant complain it was tasty if i was craving pho in iv i wouldnt hesitate to come here the service was good as wellfood always good some of their waiters are poor  i hate it when a waiter fails to keep your water and ice tea glasses with something in them  i also hate that they clear your dishes while your still eating  leave me alone and let me eatthe park has a lot of holes and cracks in the floor and a lot of the ramps need repair some ramps have water damage the staff are friendly thoughthe ice cream itself is very tasty but the service lacked something to be desired for example there were 3 teenagers standing behind the counter that were less than attentive because they were to busy talking to each other also the main reason i visited was to get the waffle cone which was very good last time and they didnt even have them availablethis place serves american style breakfast do not expect patisserie here their cinnamon roles are very large and covered in icing its a sugar coma waiting to happen the cheesecherry danish was quite good the coffee was mediocre and took a while to prepare avoid during rush breakfast hours on the weekendflies flies and more flies  it would be 5 star for take out because you wouldnt have to deal with flies  but since its a food truck its all outdoors and the flies are annoyingwhile i did not eat here i am extremely disappointed with katies pizza this past friday night i went to katies for girls night while the pizza and pasta they ordered they had enjoyed i had two glasses of their house wine 9 each glass i had asked for the check and when i received it i saw it was 1955 i gave the waiter who had asked us 5 times if we were still okay clearly ready for us to leave 15 cash told him to take 5 for a tip and said put the rest on my card i got the bill back i signed without really paying attention which is my fault i looked at the receipt when i got home and saw that he had charged my card 15 and kept the rest of my cash for himself i was extremely upset but there was nothing i could do at that point so my advice to you if you decide to go to katies pizza is to really look at the bill and make sure that they are charging your card correctly this is not a place i would expect waiters to do this but unfortunately it isi just had brunch with my wife at maynards kitchen for valentines day we had eggs benedict and beignets for our meal and mimosas and a bellini for our beverages i also had a cup of espresso  my wifes eggs benedict were better than mine as she had bacon while i had crabcakes although they were better the bacon was a little dry and chewy my crabcakes were okay not great but the english muffin was a little charred and left a burnt taste with every bite both eggs benedict were skimpy on hollandaise sauce  i had thought about having the omelet with lump crab meat but i asked in what form the restaurant receives its crab meat the waitress checked with the kitchen and then informed us the crab meat comes in a can as i wanted crab i thought the crabcakes which she said were made in the kitchen were the better way to go  our waitress was friendly but not well trained she didnt know the difference between a mimosa and a bellini she didnt bring us any silverware with our beignets we were sharing an order for dessert she referred to the creme fraiche as whipped cream and when i asked for a double espresso she brought me a single espresso  for a restaurant that tries to market itself as a highend dining establishment the performance was poor to average certainly not highend  five months ago we visited with our daughter and our dog sat outside and had a wonderful brunch i would have given five stars for that visit but today i think three stars is a fair ratingglad to see a place like this open up in voorhees but beer tastes just okay and no hard cider options apps are good overall lots of seating in the bar areait was so busy that it was hard to have a good time our food took over 45 minutes to come out and the waiter was often hard to find however the ice cream martinis kept us occupied during the long wait35  we came in on a midweek night  it was a little strange that the number of diners in the restaurant four were far outnumbered by the number of staff who seemed to just stand around listlessly  it felt a bit awkward and made the ambiance im sorry to say a bit grim    i ordered a combination platter of souvlaki and gyros which was pretty good for 1250  we also ordered a hummus plate as a starter and it was also tasty  service was good if not muted   ive been to a lot of greek restaurants and they are usually festive and happy places with a lot of laughter and a vibrant air  this was not one of them  on the plus side conversations could be easily heard between diners so no need to shout to each other in order to have a conversationsadikis is now relish nothing lasts over there for more than a couple months went on mothers day food was ok side note the seafood mac n cheese was bangin nice atmosphere but way to expensive for the area guess it weeds out the unwanted same people own warmdaddys so not really suprising about the pricesmeh everything is pretty average nothing has very much flavor below average service not someplace i intend to return tohad the buckaroo burger too expensive for what you get if the meat is high quality why feel the need to cover it up with so many other ingredients and condiments  granted im not a huge burger fan to begin with but the quality did not warrant the pricei come here every time when i am in university city food is good specially the chicken tika some of there other dishes or a bit on the greasy side but overall is a good restaurant to take your family to for a nice dinnerwish i could give this shop a better gradethe staff were friendly service was fine ingredients inside the sandwich were fresh and goodbut  the bread was standard softy hoagie roll stuff not the crusty light baguette that makes good banh mi so delicious  typical banh mi are not the overstuffed meat overload sandwiches of philly  so the doughy hoagie roll overshadows the rest of the ingredients herejust overpowering  sushi is all about the fish and everything here was about everything except the fish  all the flavors were just so overpowering here and when you tried to isolate the fish it just wasnt the quality that i expect for sushi in comparison to some of the other local options    i do think if youre someone who is all into strong flavors and the texture of the fish itself is less important youll like this place and i can see this being some peoples favorite sushi restaurant based on how strong the sauces are but for me its just too much sauce  if youre about the sauce and smells and you dont really like sushi this might be a good place to try to be introduced to sushi but if you like subtle flavors and really care about the mouthfeel and flavor of the fish id give this place a passthe food is good but they forgot my sandwich order and i had to go up and ask in order to get it madeill start by saying that this place did not get a better rating because its lack of staff hopewell valley vineyard is beautiful they had two events on what turned out to be a gorgeous saturday afternoon they only had one person cooking three people behind the bar clearly thats not enough we werent able to do the wine tasting because it would take too long it took about 45 minutes to order a bottle of wine  the staff was flustered and not in the best of moods most of the wines we tried were good the prices are decent i would visit again just hope the experience is a little betteronly tried the beer here on a saturday evening with my boyfriend space was cozy and great for a chill spot we tried the ipa and the berlin vice both of our beers tasted quite watery not a huge fan of the beer but the food looked good so we may come back to try the foodfirstly i want to say that the staff deserve the full five stars the lady working at the front was extremely accommodating and on top of taking care of my little group the chef put extra whipped cream on the girls shakes  they loved them 55  the place itself is adorable and welllit and fun the art is local and the quirky personalization are special enjoyable 55   unfortunately the reason for 35 is the food which is ultimately an important part of going out to lunch the coffee was sadly lukewarm and would have tasted wonderful with a simple fix i ordered a small kale salad and the vegetarian soup of the day i found the soup rather oddtasting and didnt end up finishing it due to strange texture and tastecombinations the kale salad was okay but nothing you couldnt get at bread co my sister ordered a ham  cheese panini and really liked it and the shakes were enjoyed by all despite the other frustrating dishes definitely consider what you order if coming here and keep with classics the more creative options may leave you conflicted   like i said hate to give a 3star review the atmosphere and staff were definitely on pointthis is not your los angeles donuts but this place is unique their donuts are different than your regular dunkin donuts and local jacks donuts pros good size good texture instagram worthy donuts if you can figured out your best creation cozy seating area friendly service cons too sweet icing complicated ordering process if you want more than 3 donuts i wish they had ready made donuts so you can pick up 6 donuts quicklythe boba here is disgusting would never go back would never recommend anyone here idk how this place have any nice reviews unless yell just have bad tastebuds stay away    edit july 5th 2014  okay so i gave this place a third try and it was better this time ordered the pad thai again and this time it tasted authenic less powder more sauce so ill give this place a 3 starmostly overpriced stuff they do have good banana whips but again overpriced as a vegetarian i had hoped for a good meal option but this is hard on my wallet and could definitely be cheaper for the amountive never had anything amazing but ive definitely never had anything terrible this place is always a crowd pleaser after churchthis place is good but not oh my gah good i wouldnt wait around for the place i got the pigs in the blanket they were okay my boyfriend got the old fashion pancakes they tasted better they do have the most fluffy butter ive ever seen hash browns were really good loved the crisp crust but overpriced almost 4 for literally 4 bitesthe cheese cheese cheese is one of the best cheese pizzas ive ever had but i have to dock two stars because the apathetic staff was extremely unfriendly they give a vibe like im interrupting their private social hour meh kids the food is good enough that ill put up with it i guessgood food decent price some suggestions when going thru drive thru wish they would give you everything at once they always give you your ice cream like 4 min before your food ok during winter but in the summer it melts as you have window down waiting for food which also sucks if your taking it home to eat but its melted by the time you get there also one time i went in with my family it smelt of dirty diapers we complained they just laughed it may have been bad bleach for mopping or a customer put a diaper in trash but it stunk so bad that we left as it made us sick why smell dirty diapers when your eating fast foodlet me start by saying that i love in n out and i would give in n out 5 stars hands down for the food alone  i am giving 3 stars for this location only and here is whywe got in there granted it was pretty late but the place looked like a freaking tornado hit it i swear  food and trash all over the damn place  tables werent wiped down or anything  pretty nasty site to see  we ordered our food and it took like 15 minutes to get it and it wasnt even that crowded which is rare  in n out usually pumps out your food asap but tonight they lagged big time  the last straw was that we got our food and our burgers still had a tad of pink in them  this is the second time both times here at this in n out i have ever had that happen to me  both times resulting in some stomach problems if you know what i mean  the fries tasted a tad funky too like they were sitting out for awhile  chocolate shake was bomb as usual  well thats my story and im sticking to itall other in n outs that i have ever been to5 starsthis one in goletaonly 3decent schnucks location my biggest gripe is the parking lot seems sort of small if you are in this area far prefer dierbergs or trader joesi cant go more than 3 stars since its local organic and gluten free sections arent as large as say trader joes or whole foods type stores   but they are the cheapest supermarket in delco and better than all of the other big brand name markets acne  super fresh  etc   plus they have their can can sales and even if their organic section is small compared to trader kids and whole foods its bigger than other brand name markets except maybe for the giant on oak ave   cashiers are quick and lines move fast that is plus for most consumers it get 4 stars but our house is organic so its get deducted a starburger up was more like burger ok  i like the atmosphere and the service but i wasnt amazed by the food it was ok at best    the atmosphere is rusticmodern  i love the big huge chalkboard talking about what farms they source for food  very cool in my book  the service was great  the hostess was awesome with her greeting and our server leah was pretty nice  now the food could use a little improvement  i got the black bean and quinoa burger with the sweet potato fries  the fries were soggy and at a lukewarm temperature  my friends truffle fries were of the same quality as far as temperature and texture go  the burger was also a little on the lukewarm side too not hot at all  my friends did not oh and awe over their burgers either    i might be back for lunch at the least but as for now not my top choicenote the location of this food truck is next to the thorntons gas station parking lot just drive up along armenia and you should see the red truck tucked behind a small make shift white fence i ordered the 4 tacos for 8 special all dressed with raw onions and cilantro the tacos were al pastor steak chorizo and fish they were all tasty and freshly made the fish tasted especially fresh it didnt have the typical bland watery taste of defrosted frozen fish my wife though said all the tacos were too salty except for the al pastor which is normally sweeter than most fillings due to the pineapple our table mates who were mexican said the red ceviche was most delicious the lemonade was not freshly madesqueezed as the sign suggested all in all a solid place to try the service was quick and friendlywe made the biggest valentines faux pas which is deciding last minute to go out for valentines day luckily thanks to the open table app we were able to secure a reservation saturday night for a peak hour seating the restaurant doesnt look like much from the outside as it is housed in a large commercial style building but the inside is fresh brightly lit and minimally decorated  i award three stars for the experience as service was friendly accommodating timely and food was executed to the best of their ability where i found it lacking was taste and temperature general atmosphere too picky we ordered the blue crab dip with parmesan cream for our first course second the cream of mushroom soup and complimentary salad for the special entree and entrees were eggplant vincent and the fish of the day redfish served whole with potatoes and vegetable of the day  the soup was served first and was under seasoned and not very hot crab dip came next and though gooey bubbly and tasty was slightly overshadowed by the pools of oil on top  the entrees were also good my boyfriend loved the simplicity of his fish and it was cooked correctly my eggplant vincent was  a cup of eggplant breaded and fried and stuffed with crab and shrimp served over a butter cream sauce and angel hair again slightly under seasoned but over all a good tasty dish overall not my pick for a romantic evening or food to write home about but suitable for an affordable seafood orientated cravingafter hearing a lot of hype over baileys range from my friends i decided to check it out for dinner one weekend with my girlfriend and her friends i went in with high expectations but was left just feeling meh at the end of the meal  i ordered one of the burgers they were featuring for the week as a part of their burger battles a turkey burger with a korean twist right off the bat i was disappointed that fries did not come with the burger and cost extra fine whatever i ordered some when my meal came it was a let down by all accounts both the bread and the burger were charred which gave every bite a bitter charcoal taste the fries were limp and soggy as if they were neglected at the pass  the only upside was the desserts we shared a strawberry sorbet and a pistachio  cookies  cream in a waffle bowl both were amazing the sorbet was tangy and tasted of real fruit the ice cream was creamy and rich on top of a freshly made waffle bowl still warm  i will definitely come back in the future for their desserts but their burgers leave much to be desiredthis was one of the last stops we made on our way to black rock city nv we ran inside to grab some postcards to send to ourselves at burning man but only found a card aisle instead we ended up buying several birthday cards and tearing off the backs to make them into a onepage postcard we stood in a slow line and paid for the cards and stamps but were then told they have no outgoing mail or nearby po boxes they also wouldnt let us leave the cards and put them in their own outgoing mail we luckily found a fitness equipment supply store nearby that was happy to mail our cards for us service was friendly but it would have been nice to have a place to mail out the cards that they sell herefirst off the name reminds me of a swim school not a restaurant and the decor is lacking and should be redone with that said the food was ok  my steakhouse salmon was pretty tasty and my husbands guinness fish and chips were also good my son also had fish and chips and he liked it there was nothing outstanding though and it was pretty overpriced not sure if i will be back but it was a pleasant enough dining experience and the service was goodi had the chicken noodle soup and it was incredibly salty and the chicken was chewy portions were small extra star for the friendlyness of the staff and beautiful decorwe read about this place in the st pete times so we were excited to give it a try   the charming environment left me confident about my upcoming meal the rusted roof gives it some originality and separates itself from the taco buses of the area   positives recommended food choice chorizo good corn tortillas in my opinion better than the taco bus not as starchy  negatives carne asada tacos could have been marinated longer i expected more flavor abrasive staff could be friendlier you are made to feel rushed to order at the counter parking limited and seating limited be prepared  overall not blown away i have had better bottom line is i expected more flavori came here hungry left disappointed the food tasted good but the price and the quantity left my stomach feeling empty better off going to a tapas place  more variety for the money the donuts were good  nothing out of this world service  well there not much of that as you only talk with the cashier and good luck getting your water refilled overall its seems as it just not my kind of placestopped in for lunch waiter had no personality  none of the wait staff were really friendly very somber atmosphere a cook pointed out to our waiter that a table needed his attention had a poor boy shrimp sandwich i think these sandwiches are special because of the roll hard to say but the roll seemed like it was day old and not fresh for the day the meal came with fries they were okay would i recommend friends to eat here  no the place was very uninspiringi remember the first time i tried chipotlei hated it  haha  and then i went backand againand againand againand then i worked for themand quitand went backa million times  its a guilty pleasureyour boujie wannabe mexican foodand i love it  this location thoughfell short  the rice was not seasoned enough  the meat portion was fine  the fajitas were super overcooked and limp    they did a great job with their guac but the chips also werent seasoned enough with lime and salt    overall it was a mediocre experience  id still pick chipotle over their q competitors anyday  3 starswe usually dine here at least twice a month part of a great dining experience is the staff and how they interact with the customers the interaction and courtesy is now missing from this venue there is no longer a welcoming atmosphere here or any concern as to the dining experience of the customers this is unfortunate as it detracts from the overall dining experience our order was not completed as asked  we were presented with a dirty wine glass to use it was wiped with a napkin but was still dirty when given to us food still good but the place is in declinei guess you could call this slot machine heaven smoker central and definitely not a vegas casino  drinks are expensive the table games just ok and the poker room way too isolated  oh but there are slots slots everywheredecent chipotle they know how to wrap a burrito the energy is nice too because they greet people as they enterat least during the lunch hour later in the day its kind of busy  i would recommend coming here over la cumbre if possible la cumbre location has some issues but see the yelp pagefor a cidery this place has an astonishing lack of  ciders we popped in after hyping ourselves up for a delicious cider on our usual thursday date night we got a flight of all of their ciders only 4 and decided there was only one of those we half liked and the rest we did not like at all and had to force down i think we like dry ciders not a lot of hops with a hint of sweetness but the ciders here were all too sweet too hoppy or just plain gross recommend going to cinder if you want to try a bunch of ciders though not all of theirs are locally brewed obviously since its a ciderpizza bar not a cideryto be honest i really struggle with this brewery i love multiple levels of their establishment but the beer is not one of them and lets face it its a brewery isnt that kind of important   lets start with the heart eyes emoji provoking assets their food is great their fried chicken sandwich melts in your mouth i didnt order this but i always get a taste of my buddies palate  their bao buns were not the best ive ever had but still tasty i actually prefer mine more on the airy fluffy side but they choose to sear theirs so its a little crispy on the outside id also prefer more crisp than fatty piece of belly inside but hey look whos being contradictory now make up ya mind tone anyways i was surprised at how much i loved the fried rice in my salmon taco i actually enjoyed a few forkfuls on its own throughout the course but even still almost all of the portions are a little small for the price quality is important though here and i feel they nail it   the atmosphere is definitely another pro if you dont like noise go away people are having fun and drinking merrily its gonna be loud so talk a little louder look at your guests when they speak and laugh at the kids next to you trying to steal their dads wings im italian im loud i love noise it makes me feel at home so the tremendously open layout of this building is much preferred over their cafe location   so the con here guys whyyy are your saisons sour no where else do i experience this and saisons are my favorites and guess what i hate sours dont get me wrong ive had a few of their beers that i have really enjoyed but overall i think this place is over hyped my thought is they just try to get too eccentric and just get a little nutty with their concoctions like i said i dont hate it but i rarely love it ill still keep going though the atmosphere food and occasional slam dunk brew still reels me ini was here with a friend of mine i ordered mixed vegetables curry and pickle and my friend ordered chicken biryani the portion of food served was very small when compared to the price i have eaten better quality indian food at better price the food had a lot of oil but it tasted good overall the pickle was charged additionally unlike other indian restaurants that serve indian pickles as complimentary the server did not know about indian food or about the items on the menu but he got another person to respond to my queriesas you enter petra you immediately know you arent in kansas anymore  the arabic music the workers in head coverings the aromatic foods all whisk you into another culture  i ordered the sampler plate off the appetizer menu  it was a full meal  the stuffed grape leaves were delicious with the right balance of lemon juice  rice but they were very oily  the kibbe was the star of the plate with its cinnamon  perhaps nutmeg spiced beef  the falafels were probably the low point of the plate  the falafels were heavily fried  had little taste  ive had superior falafel almost anywhere else  the plate came with large scoops of labneh baba ganoush  hummus  all three tasted very good  in fact the baba ganoush had a nice subtle smoky flavor  that was very appealing  my wife ordered the chicken schwaarma which i helped her eat  we thought it was very tasty  the waitress we had was excellent  the music however was not so good  it was blaring out of ancient ceiling speakers which were low quality  seemed to be torn  the music was tinny  would get full of static  the volume would fade then increase  so i give this place a mixed review  it was authentic but the food was above average to below averageclean store  plenty of choices    our first trip to an indian store  bought a variety of readymix spice packetsboxes frozen veggie that you cant find in american market frozen meal seasoned naan bread  herbal shampoo 5  it was overwhelming because there are so many choices    the store has been there for about 20 years current owner has been there for about 8 years store sits in a plaza that is visible to passing trafficyay great breakfast sandwiches at great prices plenty of seating free wifi friendly staff quick service  nay over 4 for a latte whaaaabeen wanting to try burgerrito for a while now the concept is clever burger patties in a burrito taco salad sandwich etc  let me start by saying the amount of love and attention that they put into the hatch green chile sauce and their cajun sauce is noticeable and makes these sauces stellar       now the problem is that they dont pay as much love and attention to the other parts of the whole i ordered a taco salad which comes with the green chile sauce diced hamburger patty beef or turkey chopped tomato chopped onion all on top of a bed of lettuce and surrounded with tortilla chips i had two problems with this dish  1 the hamburger was diced and not ground 2 the hamburger was a frozen patty         i really feel like this food truck has potential to be outstanding if only they put the same amount of love into all items of each dish as they do their sauces i would really like to see them make fresh or fresh frozen hamburger patties in the future maybe add some diced onion and hatch green chiles to the hamburger pattynice place to stop and eat we go just about every sunday for breakfast no matter which waitress we get they are always friendly and get our orders right it is very clean and the customer service is excellentsometimes this place is spot on like the time i had the tasting menu with morels and a cream sauce others its pretty horrendous took my dad there after raving about it and he ordered their signature burger and it came out luke warm despite the fact we were one of the only ones in there and the rest of the meal was less than stellar as well service is also hit or miss one day your server will be just the right amount of attentive the next they are no where to be foundhere for a wedding in the area and stopped over in santa barbara for some wine tasting and beach we looked this place up online ahead of time and thought it was unique being at the end of the pier we headed to the restaurant after trying out a few tasting rooms   note they do not accept reservations and are busy its a tiny indoor outdoor space their system is write your name on a sheet of paper at the front if your luck someone is there to tell you the length of a wait what you dont know are the people who are no shows due to the wait but their names are still on the list it could be a short wait but also pretty long specially for an outdoor seat   do what we did if the line is short order from the walkup takeout window i thought it was lovely and perfect for a wharf  while in line you get to view the lobsters and giant crab in their tanks view a menu as you wait so youre ready when you get to the window they are in a hurry  order your grub stake out a nearby picnic table and listen intently for them to holler your name i love the whole action of it all i would like to dine at the actual restaurant some day but this was still fun  we ordered the lobster bisque bread bowl super yum think and creamy i ordered the lobster tacos holey lobster they made sure it was lobster filled i wish there was more sauce or filling than what was provided its more food than you can finish with the rice included my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the crab cakes we also ordered an extra order of onion rings even though the crab cakes come with some we were not able to finish our extra order of onion rings manager your eyes they may be larger than your stomachi ordered their avocado shake and chicken bahn mi avocado shake was good and tasty chicken bahn mi was kind of tough and lack a bit of flavor i would recommend their shakes or shaved ice desserts but not their sandwiches or hot entreesi really want to love this place ive been here several times and the experience has really gone down hill the first few times i went after opening each time was like going to a different restaurant because the food was so different each night too spicy one night great the next too little sauce one night but barely any meat or sauce on my taco the next we went for lunch tacos and margaritas yesterday and that was my last trip the fish in my fish tacos was bland but not fishy my husbands brisket taco and beef taco had a ridiculously small amount of meat and even less sauce and the worst part they dont have their liquor license currently so we couldnt even get margarita it was a bummergreat location but the place is very tiny   you sit arm to arm with your neighbors  food is ok and i love the viewi had the korean tacos which were ok i really liked the southern taco which has fried chicken they margaritas are standard and good they have your basic beer selections and some wines available the patio is cool if you arrive and see a line going out of the door always enter though the patio then go inside the building and directly to the bar to beat the standing linestraight up texmex restaurant that i discovered when i moved here i visit this place for convenience since chipotle is too far anyway their habanero salsa is pretty good and they serve beer their burritos are huge though and i cant get enough of black beansmaybe thats why i frequent this placeordered a breakfast smoothie here  got the amazonian whey   came with banana agave cocoa and whey  for 7 bucks a smoothie its pretty damn pricey  i think the other breakfast options an actual meal are a better valuechipotle is a great place healthy affordable tasty and fast food this location has friendly staff and although the lines can be long at times theyre bearable my one issue with this location is the cleanliness last time i went i was impressed but thats not usually the casechipotle gets a big meh from me  i admit i might be hard on them because of their reputation for being amazing but i just find it to be okay  and yes i do get to pick all of my ingredients but ive been 34 times and ordered different items and combinations each time  i just dont find the flavors to be very inspired  there are other fast mexicanbuild your own burritobowl places in town that i find to be much better and will way more variety to choose from  the one thing i really appreciate at chipotle is that they offer sofritas which is a vegetarian option  im not a vegetarian but i appreciate having the option to go meatfreethere is no doubt that the food at pancake pantry is great but the customer service is lacking i understand that a business can be very busy but that shouldnt take away from the quality of the serving ive been here several times and the staff spend very little time with you if you want something you have to remind them several times before they actually bring it to you this could definitely use some improvingi used to love coming here because it was delicious and convenient  because i work in international plaza however this last visit might have turned me off for good i was waiting for my sandwich to get made when i spotted one of those employees picking at a scab being in the restaurant industry as long as i have i can tell you that thats not attractive to any of your customers might be time to reevaluate your stafffirst this place is a solid place to get some work done big tables allow you to spread out and the internet connection is good despite the place being full i also like how spacious it is   second the service is goodwhen youre there there was one saturday morning when i called hoping to just order a grab and go before a morning tee time and the girl who picked up said they dont do takeout orders on the weekends before i could ask if she meant over the phone or at all walking there and ordering was still an option for me she had already hung up didnt even say bye so i kind of just kept talking until the line went dead oops   third the food is serviceable i guess i dont think most people go here for dinner plans but eat when theyre hungry in the middle of getting some work done for that reason its a solid food place i typically have the bagel and lox though hard to screw that up the fiance had a salad with chicken and it was below average if not poor and the food did take awhile two or three parties who ordered after us got their food before us  points for good place to get work done big tables a lot of room to work coffee no points saladsi havent been to this deli in awhile the food has improved the staff is welcoming and there is a small room to sit and eat in the back there were many items on the menu which ill have to try soon this morning i ordered the pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser roll the sandwich was soft and tasty well worth the short wait  the place could be a little cleaner inside not sure i would dine in but take out seems okaynice service good sweet tea perfectly seasoned fried chicken greens so good the kids might eat them only downside i feel like i need to see my cardiologist after eating herevery nice decor super friendly service but the food was sadly underwhelming my monte cristo was soggy because of how buttery the bread was i wished it was a tad crispiertoasted the ham in it was delicious the strawberry jam was divine ill come back for sure for more pastries next timei came to baileys when i was visiting st louis the restaurant was pretty cute with all the decor   food i got the 5 mac and cheese and half power salad both were really good im not one to order mac and cheese ever but i decided to order try it and it was delicious the portion was pretty big for the price the salad was also good the vinaigrette complimented the fix ins really well   service sucked it took forever for a server to come take our order and then we waited over 30 minutes for our food to come out my friends and i flew in from los angeles for a convention and were leaving that day we were afraid we were going to be late we saw that our food was ready but no one bothered to check on it turns out they made one of the orders wrong a little reassurance would have been nice our food was almost cold when we got it we never got a refill on waters either  overall food was good but service suckedyummy baked goods and special order pies and cakes  pastry and cookies are slightly overpriced compared to beyond bread but less expensive than frog  they serve breakfast  lunch and its a nice place to enjoy a tea and baked good especially if the weather is nice enough to sit outsideive used this cvs since i moved to the area 9 years ago its central location makes it easy to access off of tampa  rd  they are very clean and well organized always well stocked shelves with an area for seasonal shopping too  the pharmacy is located in the back of the store beside the minute clinic  prices for the store and the pharmacy are comparable to other ones but the staff up front are very friendly and helpful here so it sets it apart for me the clinic is accessible and easy to make an appt most insurances cover his as well if youre not sure if yours does just ask they will know  the only thing i would say that is not 100 great is the pharmacy staff although that seems to slowly be improvingservice was good  attentive and friendly portions were large price reasonable my food was abut bland and not quite cooked to order no complaints reallyeverything else is 45 or 55 stars but the blizzards are around 1 to 2 stars first it takes forever for the order second when they give you a frozen treat you expected to be frozen instead its a milkshake if i wanted a milkshake i would probably order a milkshake remember those years when they used to smile and tip it upside down to show you its frozen not these days if you press on the break too hard its all over your cari feel like hurting someone every time i pull into this parking lot complete messfood is decent slow but ok service asked to watch a golf tournament on one of the tvs and it took them 45 mins to change the channel asked 3 times we would have stayed longer and had more drinks etc if anyone bothered to accommodate paying customersi recently worked with menu maker to cater a large corporate event in nashville  given that im based in austin tx i had to pick them without a facetoface meeting or having sampled their food  i had some issues with communication during the planning of my event but i know they are making strides to improve this  make sure that you get written confirmation of all your requests  the week before the event i was trying to get in touch with them to confirm the final event details because i knew that once i arrived in nashville i would be very busy with work and hard to reach  it took several phone calls and emails to hear back from them although the manager explained theyve been having some trouble with their phone system  we went over all of my event details and i made a couple of small changes to the menu including selecting a glutenfree and vegetarian entree for those guests with special dietary needs  i talked to her at length about which appetizers and entrees are glutenfree because im allergic to gluten as are many other people and we settled on some good choices  fast forward to a few days before my event when the event coordinator a different woman called me and proceeded to run down the whole thing with me again because she didnt have the notes from my call with the owner  i again stressed the menu changes and the importance of having glutenfree items  on the day of the event i discovered that they had swapped out one of the entrees i specifically requested and that was listed on the final menu invoice for a red bell pepper stuffed with couscous which is not glutenfree  i received an apology from the owner and assurance that she is working to improve their service  other than the lastminute menu change guests enjoyed the foodtucked in a cozy spot on watson yolklore is the type of restaurant i wouldnt expect in crestwood normally a place like this would be downtown or in clayton curious to find a place like this close by my husband and i was excited to try it out  the space and decor is like most breakfast places tight and cozy the kitchen is open faced and there are coffee mugs the menu and a listing of the specials to greet you right at the door   i ordered the bread pudding french toast and my husband ordered a basic breakfast plate the french toast was good the eggs my husband had were extraordinary and i really liked the direction they took with the potatoes using whole yukon gold potatoes instead of cubed potatoes   i had a smoothie and he had the orange juice i liked the smoothie but felt it was missing something   i noticed the manager touching tables as i ate checking to see how everyone was enjoying their meal  i enjoyed eating here however i felt it was on the pricey side 28 for two people for breakfastspare rib is really good but i think its a bit of small amount for a price we paid i went there with family and we are big fan of pad thai so we ordered it too that was a bummer it was red and taste different than the all other pad thai ive eaten in my life i would go back there just to eat the spare rib dish and some tealove the concept and luckily when we walked into this small quaint little place on the pier there was seating available at the bar we had great service and our waiter was busser and the bartender the food was just ok it meant a lot to me that it was fresh and cooked to order the clam chowder did not have a lot of flavor whatsoever i had to add the crackerssalt tobasco and luckily i carry my own little stash of cayenne pepper i have had clam chowder all over the world and sadly i cannot recommend this once it needed some creaminess butt hat could be personal opinion get a cup if you are unsure like we did a bowl of it is a big commitment there were a lot of people working and things came out very quickly  hubby had a local beer which he enjoyed and i had a glass of wine a glass of wine here means a glass loved it no frills here wine right to the top of a glass you would get at your grannys house we split the fried platter with calamari shrimp and scallops for 13 not a ton of food  3 pieces of each maybe but the coleslaw complete with raisins and pineapple was a treat and they also throw on about 3 large onion rings this was a nice dish to split so we did not ingest too much fried food there is also the option to have fried oysters on it which we skipped i imagine the more you order on the plate the less you get of each i would for sure come back here unpretentious and even a little gritty come as you are if you want fine dining there are other options on the pier they will validate your parking if you park on the wharfi thought it was marginal given all the hype i was under the impression that the burritos were relatively large  i guess mostly just full of rice also choosing steak was a mistake  it was all kinds of chewy and gristly id go again if someone else wanted to and id probably get something elsebaileys ditched the duck burger   i am devastated  it was one of the best burgers ive ever had sigh   had a pumpkin bean veggie burger on their special list once with an apple relish type thing and it was kind of a flop not well balanced and had too many competing flavors to taste any individual one not to mention i left the restaurant forgetting my leftovers barely took 3 steps outside and when i returned for my box it was already taken and lost   but their shakes are wonderful recommend the salted caramel and they have a solid local beer selection   why baileys why do you torment me so  signed               your duck burger loverbest cappuccino served at any of the drive thru merchants in town orders are always right service is friendly dark chocolate espresso bark bar is killer good and no linger available  strange layout to the lot from all driveways accessible from 39th and 38th  walkup window and casual outdoor seating availableordered a burger and salmon the bill came out to 2700 not complaining about that but the salmon was over cooked and a very chewy plus not the most pleasant of experience with customer service i got a very unpleasant stare i probably wont be backsaw the rave reviews and thought would give it a shot the pizza we ordered classic was good but not great it was the hand tossed  the dough sauce cheese and toppings were good but a bit too much bread vs other things the price was way too high considering the size and product the service was exceptional we had our pie delivered in only 20 minutes and people were very friendly  we may try again but since we are new to the area will likely try others firstreport card  steak tacos b  guacamoleb tortilla chipsc serviceb cleanliness b  price afederal is know for its donuts and chicken  there however is one issue i have with the new chicken sandwich   there are no other offerings on the menu to balance out the intensity of the flavor of the chicken   my chicken was a bit dry because it was in the fryer a bit too long but on average the sandwich is phenomenal  but its an intense sandwich with a lot of flavor   i do wish theyd lighten up on the powder flavoring maybe just one side of the chicken  but in order for me to enjoy this  sandwich to its fullest potential it needs some french fries or some cole slaw something  the price point is a bit high for 7 but seeing that they spend so much effort behind each sandwich its a bit to be expected i guess   however in this town were not about over paying for foodcyranos is known for its desserts and its pink interior remember in steel magnolias when they say the church looks like its been sprayed with pepto bismol they were also talking about cyranos the desserts here are good and if you live in the neighborhood dont want to go much farther thats perfect otherwise there are better places to go for desserts like a bakeryfor a place with brewpub in the title i dont consider this a great place to go for beer they seem to run out of selections a lot and it is never cold i guess thats part of the whole english vibe its not so bad in the winter when im going for a darker beer but if im having a light beer on the patio on a hot day i want a cold beer that said the outdoor space is really nice when its warm the bar has a cozy fireplace when its not and the food has never disappointed the menu changes a lot so there isnt any one thing i can point to but the specials are typically on pointdelicious food and cheap on the pier dont recommend the fried foods because the plate only had a few shrimp and scallops the clam chowder and pasta were delicious wish they werent out of spider crabs  wanted to try their in house special the onion rings were good too  if youre in a hurry or want to eat outdoors thee is a side window that has much quicker servicewhen we go to reno we like stopping at panda express sometimes for the good tasting chinese food its quick service and the people are friendly  my favorite is orange chicken with rice and my wife likes the chicken chow mein we always get a 2item combo with rice and a drink  so if you want something fast panda express is the place to gogood little gem on girard ave if you like mexican byob recommend bringing tequila and asking them to make you a pitcher of martguerita nice quaint interiorso it finally happenedafter years of people telling me that i need to try a five guys burger because it was the most amazing thing on this earth according to rumori did its absurd the amount of times i felt like i had somehow offended someone on some deep seeded personal level because i had not had a five a guys experience i figured man what a loyal fan base they must know what they are doing i tried not to get my expectations up too high from all the hype but it was hard not to expect some sort of spiritual and divine cheeseburger religious experience  i got a cheeseburger a regular cajun fries and a coke and man i wish i split that order with someone i didnt realize that a regular cheeseburger was a double patty if i had known i probably would have ordered the little burger instead which i assumed was a junior cheeseburger but come to find out its actually a normal sized burger also i love my burger fully dressed and at five guys fully dressed comes with mayo lettuce tomato pickles grilled onions and grilled mushrooms plus theres more toppings available upon request so between the toppings and the double patty it all certainly adds up to be a pretty hefty burger   the cajun fries where great but super salty from the all the seasoning they put on them so i probably drank enough coke to be made of coke by the time i left  good thing theres free refills  the free peanuts are a cool idea not like you have any time to eat them since the food comes out super fast there was tons of people there and huge line almost out the door when i showed up at peak lunch hour but they kept it moving quickly and i barely had time to fill my drink and pick a table before my order was up   this place is nothing if not pure efficiency ill say that much they hustled so much behind the counter that i felt like i needed to swipe on an apron and help out myself   the staff was very friendly and the girl taking my order was great at explaining how everything worked   i know a big complaint at five guys is the cost but for a double patty burger giant fry portions and a drink i cant really complain at 11 plus i probably wont ever order that much food in the future next time ill probably get a small fries and a little cheeseburger instead of regular fries and a regular cheeseburger  pros fast and friendly service big portions fairly priced  cons i found the patties to be a bit on the thin size but it certainly didnt disappointa cosy little neighborhood taco joint good food fair price weird tip situation bring cashthis is a nice little indoor snowball spot where you can sit and eat at a table if you want  they specialize in stuffing their snowballs with cheesecake here and have come up with some really interesting combinations  they use a snowizard machine so the ice isnt quite as fine as hansens but the cheesecake addition and the creative flavoring twists make this a worthy place to grab a treat ati give them three stars on behalf of the staff they are real cool the que is not real tough ribsfood was decent if a bit pricey   the home fries werent fresh but were the little frozen cubes   the omelette was very good but my green tea was some herbal concoction that was super strong   if i was in the area again i would probably try something elsehey not too bad the brew is great waitress should of checked on us more often though if they step it up a little then its a good 4 star spoti think 3 stars is generous its really a 25 the staff was really friendly restaurant was clean and food was fast thats just it its fast food i went with a basic famous star burger and it was identical to a whopper from burger king this was my first visit to a carls jr and i was expecting a little better a combo with onion rings cane to 11 and change so in parwith fast foodour concierge recommended this place for a late lunch  we had huge po boys  my catfish po boy was very flavorful  the fries that came with it were meh  we were happy with what we ate and we were so full for the rest of the day we didnt have dinner  we thought that the prices were okay  one of the less expensive places we ate at in nola but also more casual  i would definitely pick this place over the food court at the riverwalk if youre at the convention centeri stopped at gelateria del leone on a wednesday afternoon for a quick little afternoon pick me up  i ordered a small cinnamon gelato  its a cute place and i have been before and enjoyed it but on this day i wasnt feeling it  the cinnamon gelato had some ice crystals in it  this led me to believe maybe it wasnt so fresh  it doesnt help that i have had the vietnamese cinnamon ice cream at clementines creamery two times now and it blows me away  this paled in comparison  sorry gelateria  i also felt like the selection looked a little sparseyeah not much to say about since its a typical fast food joint that has a pretty big variety weve all seen the commercials  the only thing i really have to say about this location is be careful when going through the drivethru at night it happens every time i go they always forget something in my order usually its just an item or some sauces that we asked for that they forgot to put in other times they give just one ketchup packet for a large order weve had whole meals missing instead of a large curly fries weve gotten a small order of regular fries before i think the worst one ever was a jumbo jack with cheese but there was no meat patty some how jumbo jack with cheese was turned into a grilled cheese yeah that one sucked because we checked the bag before leavingive lived here for about 5 years but never even ate here because i was scared of the reviews solid quick but i could def see that many items were low or gone and options were limited as a result id recommend getting half chow mein and fried rice as the base  portions provided in the combos arent always even which is a bit disappointing opening your box and seeing mostly a small portion of mostly green beans with 3 pieces of chicken in a 23 item combo orange chicken is usually on point the beef with broccoli was alright slightly sketchy taste but beware of the sauce cause it can spill all over the bag and everywhere and be a no fun why did i choose you mess  i was surprised to see how long the line can get for this place i like how they offer you hot sauce when you leave now and wish they had the sweet  sour soup here alsopretty good pizza  very quiet location nestled in the mall  doenst deliver but they do have take out specials  if you decide to dine in they also have good specials on beer and pitchers  the wait staff was very friendly and attentivei shop with my mom here frequently  my mom has a love affair with walmart for some reason  this is by far the cleanest walmart on the south side  i usually can find most of what i am looking for here  lately i have been headed a more organic grass fed beef route and less of a processed food direction  i havent went all crazy yet and threw out the captain crunch but making small changes   it seems that overall most grocery stores on this side of town are missing the mark on offering those type of items and walmart is no different  i usually do not buy anything that is fresh here just because of the fact it is a superstore and i dont like the idea of someone ahead of me purchasing fertilizer weed killer manure whatever and then me putting my food on the same belt for the cashier  it kinda grosses me out so i just stick with fully packaged items  the parking lot congestion is really high especially by the building and trying to get out  will i be backof course every sunday with my momonly eaten here once the food was good traditional menu with some stir fry items service was good also i had the pho with all the variety of meats the beef tendon was not what i was use tofyi  they close at 530pm monday through saturday and they close at 400pm on sunday  sure the quality isnt always topnotch but i tend to look at what i pick out at least the stuff on the selfserve tables before i put it in my basket  and at their prices i have no problem throwing out some stuff thats gone bad  small onions are 5lb for 2 so if a few go bad before i can get through all 5lb oh well  half the time anything that goes bad was good to start and i wasnt able to go through it all  its not just good prices but its also bulk produce  its like costco but just for produce  i spent 45 there today  my biggest complaint would be that they only take cash  the whole lack of receipts thing bugs me too  they do have an atm there though so its not a huge problem  honestly i dont think the traffic is a reason to knock off stars for pj  its not their fault  there is a light right there  if youre going to pj turn at the light and then go into the parking lot  or drive past go downtown and turn around in one of the parking lots and come back from the other direction  i like going to pj  im lucky that im also within walking distance  its worth the walkprices are great and the food is flavorful  5th street benedict was delish however the bread of our steak sandwich was literally sticky dough and the steak was tough and fattyi feel bad here  maybe i missed something  i live local and keep seeing all of the positive reviews  my wife was in the mood for something new so we gave andale a try  well lets see the portions are a 4 outta 5  i think they are appropriate and certainly worth the pricing 5 outta 5  i did not get the same customer service feel as others on this forum  i did order to pick up but i am not sure if the guy on the other end of the phone understood the menu  although he was kinda nice definitely not rude  going in the restaurant cleanliness was a 3 outta 5  i like the concept and appreciate the home made recipes but the food was a bit bland  not super tasty not bad just average  i am not compelled to go back but may give it one more chance based on all of these great reviews  more to cometruthfully not sure what the hype is about certainly a solid variety of pancakes but the quality is not above what you can throw together out of a store box mix the sign outside boasts that theyve offered 23 varieties since they opened 50 years ago but waitress informed us that they no longer sell the potato pancakes we ended up getting the swiss chocolate 5 regular pancakes with a ton of chocolate chips dumped on top georgia peach 3 regular pancakes rolled to cover a peach compote and blintzes 3 small rolls glad we didnt have to wait longer than 10 min on a tuesday morning wouldve been quite disappointed if we stood in one of those infamous lines only to taste mediocrity plenty of other great breakfast options in town i recommend loveless cafewe had a great time chowing down at this little italianpizza joint be warned that while all of my friends tried their pizza and loved it i did not partake also there is technically parking available but it gets filled up super quickly so be prepared to wait awkwardly if you come during busy dinner time  as a large group we pretty much ordered all of the appetizers including greco salad the broccolini caesar salad the roasted bronzino crispy artichokes meatball chicken parm asparagus octopus short ribs and a multitude of pizzas including margherita eggplant mushroom and zucchii and cipolla while i cant speak much about the pizza but heard great things about the cipolla i really enjoyed the two salads especially the broccolini and the spicy chicken parm the asparagus and artichokes were a bit too overoiled or fried for my taste the short ribs were decent but just also a bit too fatty the octopus was a tad bit on the chewy side and given how much it cost with how little were on the plate id likely not get it in the future i think if you want to eat frugally the pizza and salad combination is likely the way to go as the antipasti can add up but overall its a decent but expensive little italian joint  food 34 stars service 34 stars price 23 stars ambiance 3 starsthis is a good place for bread and desserts but the sandwiches are just not so good  im not a big carb person and prefer the protein parts of my meal the most with lots of veggies on the side so this place isnt my optimal feeding spot  better to grab some bread to go and work your own magic on it  they also offer some traditional jewish breads that you might not find anywhere else in the area  i never tried any of the jewish breads and dont have any point of comparison to know if they are good or not but they looked nice  the desserts here look pretty tasty and i had a cherry minipie that was pretty decent  overall i just wasnt that impressed and havent been back for a long while nowwent to this starbucks today first visit everything ok  one of their smaller facilities but enough space where you could sit and do work on a laptopthey blend all of the ingredients together on the bowl items so essentially you are eating a smoothie with granola and honey i have had acai in san diego and in the gulf coast area that was great and in my opinion how acai bowls should be acai base and then a multitude of toppings that you can eat not a smoothie in a bowl not impressed its not horrible but i wouldnt go there again i asked why they blend it all and they said it is because the ingredients are frozen assuming they do this to cut down on costs if you want to have toppings to eat that are not blended then its a dollar a piece granola and honey are goodi used to have lots of friends that were members here and i would visit this venue often  this can be a fun place with its asian theme and lots of nooks and crannies to hide away in  they have some nice wooden carvings of naked ladies in here that are cool  this place is alright but there are certainly better private clubs in nola   as time passed most of the people i know realized that they really didnt get a lot of value out of their memberships so they dropped out  personally i prefer being on the ground floor for shows at house of blues and i really dont like being stuck up in the balcony areanot crazy about this place the staff was very friendly food presentation was gorgeous but the flavor was lacking the chicken was chewy and the chips were stale however their churros amazingalways good always a line the staff wasnt too friendly this year but you get what you pay for and kids arent growing up with the best intentions or respect these days the neighborhood around it is going downhill and the property was a mess all summer all in all its still ted drewes and cant get less than 3 stars no matter how bad it was this yeargood donuts not great would go again but would think of other options before making the trip the staff were nice and it is a cool areawawa hoagies they dont suck that should be their motto theyre not good and they dont suck if nothing else is around they will do  a shorti is 15 oz not bad the anchor around the neck is that awful squishy waspy bread   the staff at this location is a lot more pleasant than the store in oaklyn that counts for a lot  the complaints from the ooor fragile snowflakes having a hard time with the parking lot are rather amusingi am a native new orleanian and dont drink much alcohol any more  however on july 30 2016 my wife and i attended the event hops for hope at the urban south brewery  the event was organized by our neighbors  good friends the chrestmans to support hie hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy an organization dedicated to helping kids with brain damage  the brewery itself is a no frills open floor concept  basically its a warehouse with a lot of family style picnic tables set up for eating socializing and most importantly drinking  my wife had a raspberry ale which was a little too fruity for me  i tried the charming wit and was immediately smitten  well lets just say i liked it a lot  this was a kid friendly event so there was plenty of cold water on tap for the kids  unfortunately the warehouse was not air conditioned and the few fans that they had did little more than act like a convection oven as they circulated the superheated air throughout the venue  however we were there for a good cause and stayed 2 hours at which time my kid was getting too hot as were several other kids  there was live music courtesy of artist steve wulff and a zydeco band whose name i cannot recall followed him  there were two food trucks outside and the crepe cart inside with part of the proceeds going to hie  unless this venue was being used for another charity event such as hops for hope i would not recommend going here from the months of june through september as the heat was stifling  however during the months of march april october and november this place would be pretty cool to hang outwhile i love love love the frenchie turkey brie sprouts honey mustard on crunchy bread im generally disappointed when i stray great baked goods try the granola bar and peanut butter cookies but the sandwiches often sound better than they actually are also the service at the ladue location is often underwhelmingi had the spicy chicken sandwich and it was hot and delicious but my fries were barely lukewarm customer service at the counter was very friendly and restaurant was cleanwe ordered the 2 large pizzas and breadsticks for 20  we paid like a 1 extra to upgrade to cheese sticks instead  i know its only 1 but the breadsticks were burnt and they barely put any cheese on them and just sprinkled a little bit of parmesan on them the pizza was good  we asked for some parmesan and crushed red peppers  we were given 3   like how cheap can they be   we have 2 large pizzas 3 tiny little packets arent enoughive been to the knitting factory for several concerts and most recently for a show avenue q  i do appreciate that reno has a concert venue that draws well known performers and performances to the city  going to a concert here is a much different experience than a show  the concerts are general admission and everyone packs into the concert hall with no options for seating on the main floor  depending on where in the knit you are at you may or may not have a good view and you may or may not be smothered by other attendees  seeing a show here i was not sure what to expect  i was pleasant surprised when i saw that a general admission ticket meant that you just grabbed a seat in one of the many rows of chairs  the venue is narrow so there were many rows but luckily we arrived early and sat close  the sound during concerts is always pretty good but the show could have been better  tickets are affordable but drinks are pricey  what you would expect at a music venuethis was my second time coming here the first time i had halo halo and it was pretty good and super big definitely a cool sweet vibrant colored treat to have on a warm humid florida day  today a was a bit different  our first cold front for the season i had no interest in a halo halo i just finished slurping up some pho next door at saigon deli we needed something sweet to balance out all the saltiness from our delicious pho soup  theres a huge menu on the wall for pho and boba tea and smoothies again not interested  whats for dessert i ask they bakery case was there but empty not a fun sight to see when i want a sweet treat  they said heres the menu  well i am not versed on filipino desserts growing up my parents would just buy it  say try it like it or dont like it dont know the names of things help me the guy was helpful  picked out an ube or purple yam cake w cream cheese frosting hubby was already to prejudge  it bc he hates purple but he ate it up before i got a couple bites  happy we tried something new and i could recommend that but if you dont know what anything is dont just order from the menu make sure sure they show you or check out yelp picsmy boyfriend and i really like this place and we prefer it over the other indian restaurants we have tried in philly  it is reasonably priced and the portions are very filling with lots of protein in the meat dishes we almost never finish both our curries  their naan is good but not the best that ive had  i like their eggplant vegetarian curry although some people may not like that there is no texture to it becuase the eggplant is mushed up  the chicken tikka masala and biryani are good but we prefer the lamb korma and the house special makhani chicken  the saag is also very delicious and the chili chicken is very good but it tastes more like a chinese dish because the chicken is fried and there isnt really a curry sauce  their buffet is reliable cheap and good as well but the atmosphere is a bit dingy so i prefer delivery  they usually take about 3040 minutes to the domus on 34th and chestnutdoes this place have some of the best donuts in the world if they dont i am shocked  i had a donut in here that i can only discribe as outstanding fantastic fabulous the second one i had was just meh i was kind of disappointed i have been here several times and i cannot seem to get a consistent product a donut that is fresh and yummy one day is dry and bland another   the service moves at a moderate pace the first visit the place was packed and it took a while the second time the place was empty and the service took even longer they were almost out of coffee and gave us three half filled cups of warm coffee it tasted old if you have brew right on your sign shouldnt you have fresh coffee at all times just saying  i have tried the sliders and they are very tasty with quality ingredients but they are a bit pricey  this place is often a madhouse with horrible parking but i continue to go back if you are ever walking down magazine and want a little break try it outteetering between 3 and 3 12 stars 12 star extra for the location and surprising lack of sit down restaurants within walking distance to clearwater beach near the pier lots of fried options and a few broiled platters on the menu   cute decor and live music on the downstairs we sat upstairs and couldnt hear the music  we ordered the spinach crab dip for starter served with extremely salty chips it had a layer of unappetizing hardened cheese on the top but once u got that bad boy outta the way it was decent good deal during happy hour for beer on to my lobster roll i used to go out to montauk for my fix and this wasnt as good a bit under seasoned but otherwise ok  hubs got the broiled seafood and i tasted the scallops worst ive ever tasted  service was ok but kitchen mustve been backed up even though it wasnt too crowdedi guess im in the minority here but i didnt love bandit coffee  a coffee shop needs a few things to me  it needs good coffee but it should also be comfortable with good work stations wifi obviously so that if this is where youre going to sit and work or chill for a while you dont feel like your tailbone is going through your neck  bandit has good coffee and if youre in a pinch and want a cup to go then coming here is a great option  but if youre looking for a place to work or read a book or newspaper yes some people still read those then i dont think this is the place for you  it is very modern and open but their seating arrangements are bars or tables with these metal stools to sit on  basically the opposite of comfort  i like the floor to ceiling windows so you get a lot of natural light and maybe this is the kind of layout millennials are looking for  maybe young adults in their 20s like this sterile environment and dont mind a breaking chairs  perhaps they like metal stools because its really frustrating when a bar fight breaks out and you hit someone with a wooden stool and it shatters leaving you without a weapon for the next drunk idiot  but this is a coffee shop not an english pub    i like my coffee shops being more homely  some comfortable couches and chairs around and absent that seating arrangements that make me able to sit and work or read for longer than 30 minutesi expected something totally different in terms of atmosphere and display the music was some poppy radio station and it did not have the elegance of maple street but the cherry cobbler i purchased was delicious  i was irritated nevertheless by no signage for the pastries no prices no idea what anything wasits a great place to shop for produce but a lot of is not actually from local growers see the link to news article httpwwwindependentcomnews2013jan31farmersmarketharvestsdiscontentpancake house by day steakhouse by night  if you have read any of the other reviews particularly for gaucho steakhouse then you will see there have been a number of bewildered guests that have dined here  the family that owns this brunch restaurant closes the place at 3 cleans up and then reopens as gaucho brazilian steakhouse at 5 pm  both restaurants use the same entrance and space but the signs over the entrance make it look like the pancake house is on the left and the steakhouse is on the right  just go to the left regardless of when you dine here  okay so the space inside is not designed for clearing things up  there are large murals on the walls celebrating breakfast and area sports teams  and there are posters about steak as well  the space is broken up into two shotgun style dining areas  the one on the entrance side has a number of tables and a bar area towards the back  the space to the right is divided by a mirrored wall that is lined with booth seating for the tables that are located there  pull out chairs sit on the opposite sides of the bench seating     anyway i ordered my brunch selection and a bottomless cup of coffee and was generally pleased  the original benny came with two poached eggs a buttery hollandaise sauce english muffin halves and canadian bacon  pretty well executed and tasty  on the same plate some crisped hash browns came with the order to help mop up any of the sauce left over  on a side plate a colorful fresh fruit plate offered melon red grapes and orange slices  the service was okayefficient comes to mind  not a lot of interaction or welcoming attitude  i could understand if it was a busy day but the room seemed less than half full  overall if you are hungry the food is good and you just have to trust the staff to lead you to seating  dont over think it  review 503the place is nice inside lots of room to sit and free wifi its very trendy industrial decor overall everything is pretty clean not spotless but not gross   they serve a select amount of breakfast foods  and sandwiches the food tastes great we had poached eggs and bacon they make a perfect poached egg i was very impressed by that   i had iced tea and it was decent not excellent but worth it   i did have trouble communicating with the cashier she asked the order several times misunderstood my name several times and gave me coffee instead of tea not my worst experience she wasnt rude she just seemed to not understand the words coming out of my mouth    overall this place is great a lot of people come here and they seem to be regulars the menu includes breakfast items sandwiches bakery items coffee tea and some alcohol i didnt fully check as it was 7am but i know they have winetho post was updated from a 2 to 3 stars  dinner night out with the family first time to this cheddars i had high expectations after eating at the cheddars in columbia mo i should have lowered them my wifes dinner came out cold and looked awful shepherds pie she ordered the salmon as a replacement on my dinner they forgot the carrots later to find they ran out the place was so busy that our server didnt have time to remember the condiments we asked for more than twice i feel this place has real potential but they really have to add more staff to match the workload its a very popular place but i feel if nothing happens they will wither as fast as they grew   update they just brought the bill and did not charge for my wifes meal thanks im impressed as soon as i hit post on this she brought the updated bill literally within a minutethe food was wonderful but the service was very slow i was here at lunchtime but there were only 8 other people there the entire time and at least 4 staff members i was told that if i had a dog with me that i had to let them know i was there without entering either the bar or the cafe this after at least 5 minutes of waiting outside and being seen by one of the staff members after that service was still lacking the turkey apple and brie croissant with the side house salad was fabulous however i also got a peanut butter blonde which was hard and crumbly but tasty i would come back for another try but not again with just myself and my dogthis panda express is big and has nice decor  there is nice big wood table for large group lots is seating and two big screen tvsthis review is for the newly opened second location on pine street between 9th and 10th street  i stopped in this morning to check out the coffee here  the cafe options for good coffee are sparse between the washington square neighborhood and center city and i had grown tired of looking at the empty ethnics space the good karma cafe is a welcome addition to the neighborhood    i ordered an iced coffee  its good to know they come in two sizes  16 and 20 oz along with a shot of espresso at no additional charge and that they also carry soy milk  i decided to sit down with a magazine and my coffee and take in the atmosphere of the new space its very open and still feels a bit empty somewhat lacking the cozy atmosphere that makes a cafe seem so inviting  i went to take a seat in the side room towards the back of the space but the air felt a bit stuffy there so moved towards the front  the music added a nice chilled out vibe and the large paintings added some color to the otherwise white walls    the space up front near the counter is a bit barren with the exception of two notsopretty drink coolers it would be nice to see more tables here or a counter with some stools  there is also an atm inside nice i suppose if you need a bit of extra cash not sure if the cafe takes cardshowever it would be nicer if the sound on the machine could be turned off it beeps loudly every time a button is pressed kind of distracting if you are reading or studying additionally with the size of the space before they opened i was expecting more of a cafe the kind that serves soups and sandwiches in addition to coffee tea etc maybe this will happen eventually  it would really be nice to have a quick sandwichsnack option in the neighborhood  all things aside i know theyve only been open for about a week and a half and are still getting used to the new space so ill definitely returnmy experience at sliced was just fine  my reuben was really good  the broccoli and cheese soup was not overly cheesy and had good consistency  however the soup lacked salt and was incredibly hot making me believe it was reheated in a microwave   i was expecting a larger selection of soups than the three they had on the menu  ill go back and see if the options are different or if they are the standard  overall a nice change of pace but nothing exceptional from the other soupsaladsandwich places in the areathe service always seems to be slow or in different the hostess was by the kitchen to keep warm she asked if we wanted to sit at the bar even though we said to seat us away from the door  while sitting 4 tables were left dirty for 1015 minutes by the time we left  the food was just placed on the table even though one person has a food allergy  ive been to all of the bailey concepts were great service  not sure if we will returnthis is your typical mcdonalds so there really isnt too much that can be said  this one is open 24 hours and is good for a late night snack  i was coming home from an event held in st pete and needed a quick soda the wait for the drivethru took longer than usual but this is to be expected late on a weekend night   not a huge fan of this drivethru the setup is strange it is a weird windy drivethru that you practically have to be mario andretti to maneuver your car through the path   they screwed up my order but somehow i knew that would happen it was very late and i didnt want deal with the hassle of letting the restaurant know so i just decided to deal it with lesson learned check my order before leaving the drivethru especially at this locationlove their chicken strips i have only ordered takeout so i cant comment on the atmosphere much but the strips and fries are delicious nice crispy chicken always ready on time 15 for a 6 piece but its enough to feed both me and my husband   they will only include sauce if you ask for it their signature is a sweet and hot sauce its goodwe went here on a whim and the service was really great my food was really good but the rest my party was not too thrilled with their meals for reference i got the twisted southern chicken the chicken was perfectly cooked the corn and potatoes were really great  two people in my party got the short rib mac n cheese and it wasnt really what we pictured when brought out to the table and the feedback was that it was really greasy and neither of them finished their meals which says a lot since theyre both guys and finish everything i cant even remember what the dish was that we ordered but the same thing was said about that too greasy and it wasnt finished   personally i would give it a shot again but i dont think anyone else wouldthe pizza was good  the service was really good and the guys working very friendly dont use the groupon however and think youre getting a great deal because youre not i bought the 15 value for 8 ordered a large canadian baconpineapple  cheese sticks  large bowl full of lettuce and croutons and two beers it still cost me over 25 it was clean there were no other people in there until we started to leave and then a group of about 810 guys showed possibly a lunch meeting or perhaps a low keep christmas lunch the pizza was good thoughthe shop is cute and everything is displayed beautifully  there is no lot nearby so parking may be weird but its worth having to walk a few blocks in my opinion  the items were all gorgeous no sloppy frosting or whatever else here you can tell the bakers really care about their work  i found the prices a tad high to be honest but having gone through  most of my haul the quality is top notch and is definitely worth the splurge every now and again between me and my parents were got a little of everything and i really recommend the red velvet cake the best cake ive ever had seriously and the various bars key lime and lemon are not to be missed   my major complaint was nothing had prices on it so you had to ask constantly and when i went it was very busy so that quickly became a hassle  also the women at the counter seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by the crowd so things didnt run as smoothly as they should have it was early afternoon on a weekdaystill busy but im sure saturday or sunday mornings are worse maybe management should look into getting some extra help   i did want to shout out to the women at the counter though someone came in to pick up a special order cake for the kentucky derby of all things and there was some very minor issue with it that the woman was very upset over unneeded in my opinion the issue had no effect on her ability to enjoy the cake it was purely aesthetic and truly a small detail and the woman helping her was very kind and understanding and considerate when dealing with this drama queenthis place was okay they didnt have many flavors but they did have some ive never tried before which was cool i got there 45 mins before closing and felt like i was in the way of their cleaning duties and even though i finished eating at 930 i felt uncomfortable hanging around they had a lot of topping options but not peanut butter this is my favorite topping to add so im hoping they get some in the near futureaesthetics is great love the vibe and desert martinis are delicious but the traditional fare was uneven especially the  grilled pesto chicken sandwich of course i am assuming you like pesto if you hate pesto order awaygood spot for a meeting right off the trains in suburban station  lunch time crowd is too crazy  but morning hours are fine  plenty of options for good fare including dibrunos jake  maxs delidoes this place have excellent boba and a wide selection of drinks yes it does for product they are very very good but like some of the other reviewers they dont know how to implement a loyalty card program i filled up my card buying mostly the regular size snowsmoothies but then when i tried to use the card regular size was a 50 cent upsell i think they even charged me for boba it just pissed me off bad enough that i didnt come back for a year sure it is only 50 cents or whatever but it was the principle  it didnt make me feel like a special customer it made me feel like a chumpi dont normally shop at whole foods because their prices are so out of line with other grocers in town however i am having such a time getting rid of a colony of ants in my apartment making it impossible to cook there that i needed some prepared food and they have a bar where you can pick what you need and pay for it by the pound i also frequent the olive bar where they offer many different types of olives mix and match   today i remembered to pick up the instructions about how to use the amazon prime discount on sale items in the store ill be setting up my phone so that i can do thatthis place has an amazing market for anything italian  reminded me of ny  the deli sandwich however was just average for me  and i dont like when i have to reconstruct my sandwich to be able to bite into it will try again considering the great reviews and maybe try some grocery shopping the cheese and wine selection look promisingnice addition to the neighborhood but im surprised to see so many gushing reviews not kid friendly at all they have no kids menu and offered one offmenu option chicken wings with fries my kids love pho and noodle bowls but it hits the wallet pretty hard overall good to very good food okay to bad service slow inconsistentchaotic but friendly and very loudwent in around 830 hoping to beat the rush unfortunately that wasnt the case we sat in line for about thirty minutes to be seated and when they noticed my wheel chair they had another group jump ahead because there was only one table that was wheelchair accessible the table wasnt even wheelchair accessible it was just out of the way i had to get out of my wheel chair and scoot onto the bench service was quick i ordered the route 66 burger which i recommend and bottomless fries to share unfortunately i only got one serving of fries the oreo milkshake was delicious it was like a melted mcflurry you could tell it wasnt from a mix because of all the big oreo pieces the waitress was a little rushy bit thats to be expected when groups of 15 people are waiting to be seatedwe went for a late family dinner  it was good  the seafood gumbo was very very tasty and very hot  however we all agreed that the food couldve been hotter  it was cooked but not served hot  just warm   overall the diner can not compare this restaurant to crabbys  this restaurant has 10 fold a better selection of food on the menu  so if you have your choice to go to bills or crabbys choose billswe ordered cherry and mango flavor water ice  the cherry flavor tasted like medicine and it tasted very blend  mango flavor on the other hand was a lot better  definitely tasted some real mango inside  i wouldnt say its better than ritas but it tasted more naturalgood pancakes and they should be after 50 years or so of business  used to also be a place to see the occasional celebrity chowing down on some awesome sweet potato pancakes but i doubt they wait in the line these days  theyre famous for a reason  their pancakes really are good and they have a nice vibe inside friendly service and the prices are fair  if you dont mind standing in line for a while come see why theyve been around so longoh how to not write a positive review  what i mean is that nearly everything that i dont like about the fs has nothing to do with the fs  for what it is its a great place to see yes see you cannot sample a variety beers available in tennessee  the staff is friendly and the girl i spoke to knew her shtthats a big positive   the downside of the fs is the  beers available in tennessee bit i mentionedthere just arent that many of the nations greatest beers available here  thats not a failure of the fs thats a failure of a political culture that treats high gravity beer as magically separate and hence discourages most great breweries from even attempting to negotiate the treacherous waters of a bipartite distribution system  but i digress  the fs is a great local resource  check them outeveryone in this place was rude it seems like everyone was in a rush even though it wasnt busy  we didnt even get to finish ordering before they were trying to end the transaction and seemed annoyed when we tried to update our order to include more because apparently they had decided that was enough for us  the food is always good so im not really worried about that but i was definitely out off by the servicesothis location was recommended by one of the hotels during our stay we had a rather large party and ordered a bunch of a appetizers calamari was awesomeeverything else was kinda regular mac  cheese is really good was oversold on the alligator wings by the waiteri would put cheeseburgers in my top 5 favorite foods so i am always up for a good burger i had been wanting to try burger up for awhile and finally got my chance a few days ago well unfortunately i was pretty disappointed i ordered the buffalo burger and it was nothing special at all i have had many buffalo burgers in my time and this was the worst one i have ever had also i love ketchup and they use a homemade ketchup that i hate its extremely thin and runny almost like water and has no taste   but like the ketchup the place tries to be unique and become the first burger place to cater to the health food conscious yuppie crowds but it fails a burger place is not meant to be healthy its only meant to be delicious no matter how many calories are involved if you are in the mood for a good burger i would suggest going to the pharmacy in east nashville or at least the five guys across the street  pros  decent fries nice staff ok prices clean bathrooms  cons  bland runny homemade ketchup mediocre buffalo burgers tries to be a healthy burger place and fails tries to be too differentthe pizza is good id give more than three stars but the pizza is way overpriced ive ordered takeout twice both times the pizza was good their pricing makes me assume they will go out of business eventually dont get me wrong i like their pizza but theres equally good pizza for less money out there i hate to see a locally owned and operated pizza place go under because of pricing ive seen it happen in downtown saint pete couple timesdont know why it has to happen here in dunedineh nothing to call home about no wait there was this small thing at 8 am this morning they only had one pancake left seriously an establishment that serves breakfast and lunch should really stock up on pancake mix the food was okay i landed on french toast but id much rather stick with dixie picnic down the street for a less expensive and seriously delicious breakfast or even nudys if i want something comparable in price and decorpretty decent place to bowl their rates are fair its a pretty chill environment only down side is the food the food was awful eat before you arrive and all will be well i had an apple fritter glaze and gooey butter cake the apple fritter was decent and i would eat it again the batter for the other two donuts was really dry and floury probably the same dough but fritter ingredients helped they were some of the worst donuts i have ever tried the topping on the gooey butter cake was okay but needed more of the cream to counteract the dryness of the donut   i give them a bonus star for being open until 12 am on weekends because it is awesome to be able to get a donut late however if deciding between going to a krispy kreme with a neon hot now sign on or strange donuts i would pick krispy kreme every time and probably eat a half dozeni am giving 3 stars but i wont be back its simply too expensive the cheapest thing on the menu is 8 for a little container of fresh juice i ordered one with apple pear kale mint etc and the girl got it from the fridge i am guessing it was pressed that morning  but not sure there is plenty of space and chairs and there is free wifi which makes it a good spot to work or meet people but i would probably need to bring some solid food in with me  most other drinks average 10 for a 1416 oz drinkits just not sustainable unless youre moneybagsfavorite pralines in french quarter they have delicious traditional pralines but also have fun unique flavors like peanut butter and sweet potato both are amazing by the wayi am not a philly native and perhaps do no have an appreciation for philly cheesesteaks when i moved here everyone took me to their favorite city spot  i had to be polite and lie because i do not get the point  whats good about eating a sandwich with hardold bread gross meat and canned cheese   jacks steaks and shakes is not that good soft and warm bread good meat chicken and tuna with nicer cheeses including blue cheese my favorite  if you expect a traditional philly cheesesteak this is not your place perhaps a gourmet interpretation of it i like their fries soft bread cheese options and specially the buffalo chicken the location is good new and well maintained really cool  i take 2 stars off because of their processservice each time i go theres something funky with the service  1 you order pay and not clear on what to do do i sit down wait at the counter and after i am done do i leave the basket on the table or take them back   2 crew seems to change a lot last time i went and asked for my usual the girl told me they dont do blue cheese but the guy at the grill overheard me and corrected her   3 another time they messed up our party of four order food came minutes apart the wrong sandwiches etc   4 the girl asks you to sit down but then brings two drinks or sandwiches at a time what about trays in the process has to take care of other clients and as a customer you are left waiting for her to finish so i can get my coke  the place its been open for a few months now they shouldve figured a process by nowi was super disappointed after trying eddies this morning first of all they have mostly cake donuts which i am not a fan of but i cant fault them on that when i walked in people were yelling and i was a bit freaked out i got a dozen donuts because im not going to go to a donut place and not get a dozen the price was good  the filled donuts were barely filled the chocolate cream filled donut was pretty good just had hardly any filling the custard was really gross in the one i ate so i guess in that way im glad it wasnt filled with more  the price was good the donuts were ok maybe it was just a bad batch because so many people on here seem to love it but i wont be back to seeopen til 3 am for those late night hunger crawls but be willing to throw some bows because this small little fast food joint is packed in the wee hours of the night  its an extra 2 for specialty fries garlic parmesan skip so soggy after being tossed in olive oil  cheesegross truffle fries nice  crispy the winner of the night  you can choose your sauces for dipping the fries i liked the spicy fry sauce much more than the white house sauce i think those are the 2 most popular ones  i wouldnt go out of my way to try 500 degrees in phili but if youre craving fries after a night at the bars might as wellsolid 35 stars  i was pleasantly surprised    the popcorn chicken was a little heavy handed with the black pepper but it was fried perfectly not greasy at all and really tasty    the chicken basil dish reminded me of home cooked meals by my dad when i was younger  tiny bone in portions of chicken with a nice sauce and yummy basil leaves garlic and slices of ginger    the scallion pancakes were also good but i can get the same thing out of the freezer section at an asian grocery store  but the sauce they comes with the pancakes  delicious  if they got said sauce from a bottle please let me know what its called and where i can find it  the braised beef noodle soup was nice  the broth was a little lacking in flavor but nothing i cant fix  the noodles would have been better if they used fresh egg noodles in lieu of the linguini type noodle they use but its just a personal preference  the beef was tender and easily fell apart definitely a must order especially when its cold and rainy outside  the oyster pancake was not our favorite  im used to the one my dad made at home and its a lot crispier than 101s  this dish came out extremely wet and gelatinous and i couldnt swallow it down without thinking about something gross  the service was really friendly  its a shame that 101s got some bad reviews in reference to service and im glad that i didnt have to experience that this trip   we would definitely come back againthis guy loves foodand cares i might try this place again i think this guy might have some good ideas we will seehigher prices yes  surly staff probably  poor selection i have to quibble with that one  its not the selection thats bad its the quality of whats available thats bad  the last time i was there i think i literally picked over twenty jalapenos before selecting three that seemed like they were in at least marginally acceptable condition  but hey at least they have jalapenos  this may be my fault for being from california but if i cant get jalapenos serranos and anaheims in good condition in the same place its almost too much to bear  anyway as a carless shopper this place has saved my poorplanning ass more than once  if i need molasses i know they have it  if i want brussels sprouts my odds of finding them here questionable condition notwithstanding are better than any other place within a four block radius  sometimes when its 15 degrees out thats just enough  tack on the additional halfstar for carrying my beloved method home cleaning products and i have a solid threestar experiencethe bbq beans were very delicious the tripi with the chimichurri was seasoned wellspent many days in the original in new jersey actually competed pagainst them for a while  good sub decent service that used to be aces  but as the franchisee has opened more stores the thinning ranks of competent employees is obvious also way too expensive for a sandwich two giant meal deals will run you around 3000  this isnt the north east and they are just sandwicheshey  pull over  theres an applebees  our server anthony was great friendly  informative quick  attentive  we were hungry  it was decked out for halloween  the chicken lime 550 calories grill platter is what i had  stanley had the bruschetta chicken salad  yumthe food is good  the deserts even better  the pricing is painfulthis jb was at the top of my list for the fast food place to go whether it be getting it for lunch during my high school days or grabbing it on late nights its your regular fast food place with a decent amount of options they have really good sides and i cant get enough of their jalapeno poppers the mini churros arent bad either you are going to feel it in the morning but it felt so worth it at the time i will always have a place in my heart or artery  for you jack in the boxthe june 2012 night market on washington ave was crazy  by 630pm hundreds and hundreds of people descended on the street and took advantage of the outstanding food trucks and stands for this occasion  i managed to snag a porcetta sandwich from espositos a tamale from the tamale truck lemonade from some lemonade stand and macarons from my boys at sugar philly  as far as it goes this was the most intense night market i had ever attended three total  there were so many people super long lines and pretty hot weather  i might go back if there were new vendors but i think ill go for baltimore stroll before another night marketcute little spot but expect to wait for a breakfast table check in through yelp so you dont have to wait long chicory coffee was delicious but not hot grits were runny which was surprising their biscuits were pretty amazing thoughlets start with first impressions it was a 430 pm dinner on a sunday night and the hostesses had scowls on their faces it wasnt busy yet i ordered a beer that didnt come out until dinner also i was charged for a 10 beer when the one i ordered was 5 we ordered an appetizer that didnt come out at all  on the bright side i had the chicken chimi and it was very good my wife had the chicken quesadilla and it was good but she probably wouldnt go back  i would give it another chancethis year old biproduct of the former francos trattoria had its work cut out for them  located on ridge avenue it can be easily missed with the busy traffic and multiple businesses clogging east falls   when i first arrived i had to tip toe my car past the crowded and small parking lot  as i arrived at the front door with my friend i noticed the outdoor dog park and benches  although a great idea the first smell i had walking into this new establishment was pizza grass and dog shit    the interior can be easily mistaken for a high end italian restaurant  everything was redone from the old restaurant and definitely had a continental feel for it    i headed out back where they recently added the outdoor patio  service was excellent as we never ran dry  there was actually a yelpsponsored event where a handful of strangers formed minicircles as they got to know each other like a speeddate event  eh id do it for the free food and drinks  the pizza wasnt bad  not sure how else to describe it  i felt like the toppings were good but the crush was soggy and i felt like i had to struggle keeping the cheese on the crust itself  wasnt the best and wasnt the worst  but at that point i was feeling good from their beer wine and specialty drink list    the restaurant has a great location and it is definitely a good time with a friend or a hot first date  be sure you have a pack a gum after eating the pizza to round 1st base at the end of the nighti was actually a bit disappointed to find out later that the habit is a franchise restaurant  i was led to this restaurant because my bf had worked out our travel itinerary for santa barbara and a yelper had described this place as having the best burger in sb  really now  my bf got the teriyaki charburger  he said it was good and it surely did look good  but he said the teriyaki sauce was a bit overpowering and he wasnt able to taste the burger itself  i got the veggie burger sandwich as i am a vegetarian  i got it on grilled sourdough with cheese  it was average  the patty was just a regular gardenburger patty they probably took out of the freezer    what i did love was the onion rings  amazing onion rings  seriously what kind of batter did they use  my bf felt like it tastes like the same batter used for crunchy fried shrimp  the onions were cooked perfectly so that when you bite into the ring you actually bite off the onion cleanly without dragging any of it out of the breading  perfectly crunchy with flavor mmmmmm  this location made it look like a holeinthewall place with its outdoor seatin and orderatthewindow and pickupatthewindow style service  convenient parking lot in backyou wait in line for a long time to get soso custard  there are so many great local custard places now that do deliver a good product without the wait  i understand part of the appeal is the social aspect of standing around with hundreds of others waiting but to me i would rather go to a quiet custard place and enjoy the treat in peacei eat here at least once a week so why three stars for one thats as high as i go with chains also i eat at four different locations on a fairly regular basis i admit its a problem some time during the last three months it felt like they started cutting back on the portions nonetheless always clean food is delicious staff is nice enoughwe dined in for lunch on a weekday waited about 20 minutes for outside seating not bad service is super cool here waiters and hosts were super attentive and pleasant the seafood is fresh they had local lobster available as well as other live seafood made to your liking   the clam chowder was decent i thought my lobster was okay it was a bit tasteless my friends shrimp tacos were bland and not too good as well   id stick with the freshlive seafood next time do check the prices as wellthe live stuff can be pretty expensive depending on the weight and alli am going to have to give this place only 3 stars we sampled several flavors bubblegum strawberry champagne blackberry and we finally got blackberry and just a chocolate gelato we being my daughter and myself my daughter got sprinkles on hers   positive i love the space it is bright and very bold the service was good when they were paying attention they let you try as many flavors as you would like to the gelato is pretty healthy compared to ice cream the chocolate is fab and i also tried one of their peanut butter bon bons which i could have eaten 12 of   negative the staff as friendly as they were when talking with you were kind of rude in the aspect that they would talk to each other before helping a customer and there were 4 staff members the blackberry did not taste good once you had more than a sample it tasted a lot like black licorice with seeds the price is not what i expected for the small container that you get the sprinkles were gross i had to waste part of the gelato to get them off in my opinion they tasted like foam or what i think foam would taste like   would i come here again maybe but it would not be my first choicesunday afternoon for lunch ambiance was nice dark wood bar area open and airy with large windows and bigscreen tvs for sports fans etc the main dining area is your typical grid layout with a large buffet area deep in the area serving sunday brunch appeared very clean and wellorganized and decorated   hostess typical 20something with long hair and an unnatural habit of saying like entirely too much and a nervous tic of stroking her hair while she talks without making eye contact quickly delegated our seating accommodations to some poor coworker who happened to walk up to the front counter at the time we were ready to be seated   server nice enough really i mean really pushed the brunch buffet  i wonder why i guess its the most commonpopular sunday afternoon choice took a while to obtain actual menus but not an intolerable amount of time interesting that even though this was our first trip here he never emphasized any other popular menu items aside from the brunch buffet he did give valuable feedback when i asked about items    ordered the overlake sandwich and the bltavocado sandwich i had the overlake partner had the blta he wound up wearing most of the a messy sandwich  my order had a good presentation tasted great no complaints really i mean who can complain with something when its smothered in bacon id probably order it again   i would like to go again to order from the dinner menu and check that out its a fairly new establishment in this chain so its decor is current and appealing the hostess was okay the server was good not great the food was good no dealbreakers here but no real reasons for me to activate the culinary phonetree and recommend it to everyone its a good option to occasionally break up the monotony of eateries in the cool springs areabeen here twice and it was ok quaint little dining place in woodbury it used to be a train station hence the name theyre great for serving beignets food was ok nothing speciali really was not in this place long enough to say too much i know right when we walked in i got a chain feel about this place reminds me of a disney epcot beer garden or tgi fridays stuff hanging from the walldid not have the local bar feel we stopped in to have drink after dinner we grabbed a table and then to my delight i saw a whole shelf of games you can play at your table so after grabbing the last cards against humanity we played at the table for an hour laughing way to loud and making horrible card combinations since we stuck to sitting at a table we relied on a waitress and i have to say service was pretty slow and they were not super friendly but i do love the whole games aspect and would recommend this place for a group and of course a round of cards against humanityfried tofu was amazing  but everything else was way too salty i had to gulp down at least two cups of water throughout lunch we tried to redeem the 10 of 40 check in deal when our total came out to be 3934 and the lady waitress insisted that we bought something elsei pass this place all the time and finally thought id give it a try the ambiance is nice for this place lots of variety and options but everything was mediocre i had some high hopes for this place but i  dont think ill be going back anytime soon service was fine thoughthis is a close grocery store to me and while convenient it is incredibly pricy things may even be a 1 or 2 more than frys i only go when its easiest for me  it is a nice place to grab some prepared food breakfast or hard to find ethnic foods   great wine selection  will go again only when i need to   i usually buy all my birthday cakes when neededparties here they do a great jobtacos here are inventive and as much as id like to give them more stars they just didnt wow me with the taste dont get me wrong the tacos tastes great but so does a double cheese burger from mcdonalds its definitely a great place to come for a quick meal they are always packed but everything seems to move pretty fast which is a plus friendly staff and okay atmosphere id stop by againi went to the outpost with colleagues on a business trip this place had by far one of the best bar trivia nights we all had a great time we stuck mostly to beer so i cant review the cocktails the appetizers were better than youd expect from a bar but the fries were perfect   the service was slow but the server was pleasant my water wasnt refilled the entire time i was there and my colleague had to fetch her twice to get another beer that may simply have been because it was an event night and the bar was pretty busy im told thats not typical if youre in the area and looking for a casual bar with decent food and great trivia nights this is the place to gothe family and i are visiting and decided to stop in for lunch the staff was nice and the place was clean the food was ok but a bit over priced for what you geta restaurant has to have a hook these days and one of baileys is the dairycowrustic farm theme right down to the milk can lights and assortment of old windows over the central community table in the bar area the first floor is open to the second floor lending itself to increased noise level which it was the night we were there burger joints seem to be the in thing and this is a burger joint but definitely an upscale one both in their offerings and their prices   another hook is the option to have your burger made from a variety of sources bison lamb beef pork chicken or veggie all cooked to order and on your choice of bun some of their condiments were unfamiliar to our group sriracho mayo rooster sauce all in all an interesting concept our burgers were good but we all agreed they didnt make it on our best ever list and 1112 for a burger is pretty steep in my world  youre obviously paying for the concept  cutesy atmosphere rather than a wellexecuted burger and when you add in drinks and dessert it ends up being a pretty pricey night out especially with a family  service was soso the hostesses seemed preoccupied with their own conversation our server was friendly and answered all our questions about the menu but she was pretty much mia after she took our order we didnt order dessert and after reading other reviews sounds like we missed out on the one thing baileys does exceptionally well3stars for being good but over priced unless you are  a senior then you get a good deal and it is well worth it    usually the place is either empty or near empty in the morning  and its most often seniors who are there it really is a nice place we also really think that it is usually really empty because it is really over priced  i mean there are often more staff than customers in the morningafternoon because they have prices that keep people away  seriously omelet toast and coffee is near 15 and with wife its near 30  i would like to give the place a better review as we like it there however we also feel stupid for spending that much on eggs and toast  we  only go there when our parents are visiting as the senior deal is a good deal for  theminteresting st louis tradition have many st louis friends who have told me about it  before i ever tried it but im from milwaukee which lays claim to being the original custard location leons  of tvs happy days series and where its a much bigger thing than it is in st louis however drewes has tried the trendy dairy queen mixtures not only with success but with some really nice variations i love sour cherries and even in wisconsin all you get is bing cherries in custard drewes sour cherry and hot fudge is a great experiment next time however i want to try it just plain to make a comparison with milwaukeeto clarify i did not mean to imply nor did i say that the restaurant had no french influence or dishes  the menu is fine its mainly the bread that i hope will be improved  to me good french baguette has a crusty brown exterior and an airy interior  what i found at ghinis as typical in the us was pale without a significantly crusty exterior and a uniform interior without the characteristic air pockets theres really a big differencea completely ordinary breakfast and an outrageously long wait thats what you get at the famous pp  a good breakfast tasty and well prepared but not special by any means what you end up waiting an hour for is the name and the reputation you can get as good or better breakfast at lots of places in town without the outrageous wait standing out on the street   pancakes were 100 average been eating flapjacks for over 50 years and these are pretty ordinary  servers were very friendly and the atmosphere is fun a good family place if your family doesnt mind standing in the street for an hour waiting to be seatedi went for dinner last night with family we were seated promptly but it took over 5 minutes for our waitress to say hi and take our drink order she always seemed in a hurry to talk to us the place seemed understaffed i ordered the filet mignon it was cooked perfectly medium was actually pink the sides were unassuming a side of broccoli that i didnt think was seasoned in any way and some crispy overcooked potato wedges slightly spicy presentation was poor and it looked like any amateur could have done that i give it the three stars based on the meat alone otherwise would have been lowerso i go to this cafe a lot and i gotta say that lately ive been really disappointed with their kale salad i usually get the same thing pesto grilled cheese its a goto for me and i always get a side of the kale salad but the last 4 times its been prepared differently and it always looks like it shouldve been thrown out four days ago the grilled cheese is always on point but im gonna have to switch to a different side because im convinced this kale salad is not being taken care oftried the st louis ribs the meat fell off the bone it was so tender the bbc sauce wasnt really anything special it came with mac and cheese and i enjoyed it quite a bit fast and friendly staff the server was fast to refill my water all 6 times seeing as i was quite hungoveroverpriced food stinks like smoke everywhere when im hungry and it smells like cigarettes i feel like throwing up i only stayed there bcoz i had a gift card they smoke at the bar only but it smells even at nonsmoking areas the food was both good and bad good the bbq ribs bbq chicken fries veggies there was a musician who was singing on stage bad mash potatoes caesar and coleslaw salad there are no prices for any of the drinks both alcoholic or not i asked how much is the tea and the waitress didnt know well then have it in a menumore of a tourist site than a place to go for value and good food  dont get me wrong as the shell fish is good and fresh but very expensive and terrible atmospherethis place is a bit overrated while the service was great i think you can find better sushi almost anywhere you go i didnt dislike my yellowtail canopy rollbut i also wasnt impressed by it the yellowtail canopy was finely chopped rather than the normal whole pieces of fish which i worried was hiding bad quality fish i ended up removing it and basically just eating a spicy salmon roll we also had the sashimi sampler meh and the pork dumplings which were actually very good   i probably wouldnt come back if not for our very attentive waiteri must be missing something on this one  the food was okay  the service was okay  the price was okay  i cant say that that i didnt enjoy dining there but given the reviews i read on yelp i was expecting so much morepub and kitchen has well prepared well presented food  the menu is small for entrees more selection for appetisers  the server nate whom waited on me both times i have been there is friendly engaging and adds to experience  i had the soft shelled crabs which were the special last night and they were great a little to peppery for my friend my fiance had a homemade blueberry infused vodka which she enjoyed  the only issue have with pub and kitchen is the price  the portions are small and the price is large  so be warned this is a rittenhouse restaurant with rittenhouse prices  dont let the pub in the name fool you its not a place for a quick inexpensive bite to eat  also i think if your special is going to be several dollars more then your highest menu item you might want to mention it  blueberry vodka  which was suggested was 16 a pop which seemed a bit high too  overall nice place just be aware of the size to price ratioand dont go there starvingour group of very seasoned new orleans travelers recently tasted the 5 most famous creole pralines in the french quarter and southern candymakers came in 3rd    we actually tried 6 but i dont count mr apple as famousyet   our tasting was of creole pralines only and here are the results 1 leahs   2 mr apple 3 southern candymakers 4 aunt sallys formally our favorite 5 lauras  6 the praline connection yuckwe tossed them out  i will say the location staff and other products are all dynamite here at southern candymakers so you wont be disappointedbut if you are looking for the best of the quintessential products then there are two places betteras a fan of paneras food i usually find myself stopping at a panera wherever i see it  i generally order the same thing wherever i go the cobb salad with chicken or a panini sandwich  often times the food is good and i cant complain  what i dont like and usually find this with most paneras is that the dining area is a mess  dirty tables with crumbs chairs and tables out of place it seems like they cant keep up with the amount of traffic they have  the other complaint i have are the prices which are pretty expensive when you think about it  but hey they accept apple pay and that makes my life easier halike a lot of people i have a lovehate relationship with whole foods  i love their selection of specialty foods i have been able to expand my cooking repertoire because of them i love the cheese bin that meredith also mentioned i scored a little nub of idiazbal on sunday that i am way too excited about you can make a great cheese plate for two or three people with these little pieces i also enjoy their sales especially on produce they some times have ridiculously low prices on grapes mangoes and avocados the employees are generally nice i think ive only met one disgruntled cashier ever   on the other hand i hate their high prices especially when it is an emergency item so i cant shop around i am not a fan of the clientele but at least there arent a million babies like at suburban grocery stores the salad bar and hot food bar are sooooo expensive only made that mistake once meat is really pricey even when it is on sale and finally i hate hate hate the hot dog  hamburger buns they carrythe food was great the place is in the parx casino and they are getting the staff together but it looks like the place will be more fun once they have more entertainment come in to do shows the decor in there is fabulous they had a beautiful wall design and a fireplace thing that looked like you were in the lex luthers dinning room from superman the food was perfect reasonably priced and cooked to perfection i had braised beef the meat was delicious so tender and juicy and my friend had the salmon everything was perfect and the price was so inexpensive i will defintley check it out again soon to see how things are after they have been open for a little while longerpretty good food the salads my codiners ordered were sort of swimming in dressing but my salmon and veggies were very good interesting decorexpect a wait  line to get a seat was about an hour and then another 45 minutes to get our food when we left the line still started at the same spot worth the hype i would say no the food is okay but the price is great for a brunch place got the santa fe corn meal pancakes and it was good for the first few bites but needed a change of flavor wouldnt recommend the hash browns they were averagethis is a cute little place very reminiscent of the pizza parlor i used to visit as a kid  they have a nice outdoor seating area that is very cozy too  overall the food was ok  service was ok too  i asked for ranch and the server totally forgot about it  they have some good deals with the axxess card so its definitely worth a trip if you have that  the leftover pizza tasted differently than any i had had beforeit left a layer of fat on my tonguedo not bring a large group here they do not have the staff to handle it had to leave with many unserved  unhappy studentsi ordered a shrimp cauli bowl via uber eats my order came quickly within a reasonable period of time my food was cold im thinking its the clear plastic clamshell container used it doesnt keep the heat in not a big deal for me my total without the uber eats surcharge was 1990 for close to 20 i would expect more than a container with 80 brown rice some diced cauliflower 6 florets if broccoli literally i counted 3 paper thin slices of carrot and 8 measly shrimp it did taste good but it is waaayy overpriced for what you get i will give it another shot on a day when i can actually go in in person but initial reaction is not that sofresh is not soimpressivegreat space building and staff  go there for the coffee and large tea options but i wouldnt go there for the pastries  damn tried muffins scones cookies and anything that might help feed a morning hangoverhungerall kind of sucked  wanted to give a 25  but its a coffee shopthis caf certainly is cozy great ambiance perfect for a quick pastry or have coffee with friends you can choose to sit at a table at the bar or in the nice couches area   they offer a great selection of coffee i had a latt and it was delicious however i went there at 9am and had to realize on the spot that this is not a breakfast caf they do offer a choice of 2 breakfast sandwiches but it was very disappointing small tasteless and soggy makes me wonder why they bother serving that it gives the wrong idea of their potential   still i really enjoy the place and will definitely come back and try morewe stopped in for a quick lunch today we had not been in a long time gyro plate was mediocre at best i was very disappointed there are too many good restaurants in nashville  so i wont be back meat was bland pita had no tasteeh i was hungry it was alright i looked for something savory in the menu and got healthy instead nice staff would visit again if i was in the area and really hungrythe fish is great but the macaroni is straight out the box for the prices they charge i expect something other than kraft mac n cheese the jerk chicken is good they raised their prices a lil while ago which sucks i would probably go more often  if it were cheaper since i work across the streeti am a huge fan of bullys food i think they have delicious pulled pork and sides but their service tends to be slow and not good quality we had our rehearsal dinner here and while the food was delicious they only had one person working the entire back room catering for about 40 people drinks were not being served we ran out of food even though we paid for it it was very disorganized i would definitely recommend eating here if you are looking for good bbq but i think they need to reconsider their catering and poor servicegreat new location adjacent to the greenbelt with vast selection of payette beers have been there a couple of times  the problem is the noise level which was very loud last evening when i was last there  we moved a table out into the patio area which helped seems like they need to work on the acousticstook 20 minutes to get their basic burger not worth 12 after tip decent atmosphereif this review were based solely on the waitstaff and presentation it would get a five  our waiter was attentive without being annoying and when my sister and i said we were going to share everything they brought the sandwich that we ordered on two plates  we ordered two appetizers the chicken tamales and the avocado fries and the chicken monsieur sandwich and just asked the waiter to bring it all at once which he did  the avocado fries were pretty delicious and i love the sauce that they serve with it  the tamales were ok and the chicken sandwich while it was kind of inventive and the description of it in the menu made it sound delicious it was just ok also  the coleslaw served with the sandwich was very oniony not to our liking  everything was served really beautifully and i really liked the dishware that they use there  i would go back if im ever in the area and try something differentportions are small but it is all you can eat only rule i am not a fan of is that everyone at the table has to pick all you eat or all has to pick the regular menu not all you can eat so it is all or not1 the beer is good 2 its a working brewery 3 the tour is okneat 4 some beers are way overpriced summer blond is a light beer with a low grain bill and 20 bucks for a 12 pack of cans when purchased at the brewery with no distribution costs is insultingfirst off i am not a huge beer drinker so this really wasnt my scene however the food was good a tad bit pricey and the atmosphere was really cool service was okay not outstanding but passable out of everything that i saw i would have to say that the depot burger looked the best parking could potentially be a hassle as this place can get busy and they have a fairly small parking loti feel like this place is a local applebees  their food options are impressive and diverse but the product was only average    i went with my dad as he is from out of town and i thought hed appreciate the local beer options which he did  he had a black bean burger for the first time which he said was good but nothing too exciting  we started off with the goat cheese dip and curry crackers which was pleasant  i had the pistachio ravioli  the sauce on my ravioli wasnt too heavy which i had worried about and the filling was interesting but didnt make me sit back in my chair    our server was nice and helpful in advising us in what to get when we looked a little lost  he was especially good when it came to beer recommendations which was very helpful  all in all though if youre looking for something astounding i wouldnt come here for dinner  just a little better than alright with a variety of options  here you gotwo words popcorn chicken  definitely my go to food here what with the large portion they give and the super low price of 5 you cant go wrong with that their mali tofu fish was also pretty good not spicy but flavorful their dishes also were big enough to share family style which worked out great for my 10 group with luther dishes of course their boba is a little sub par but being that we are in reno which isnt really known for good boba it does the job i order their milk tea with boba and like i said its not bad   although their service is a little on the poor side their great prices and big portion size make up for itthis tim hortons is attached to the shell gas station  has a convenient drivethru  its usually quite busy in the mornings so expect a bit of a wait in both the drive thru and inside the employees are okay nothing too extraordinary i will admit they do often get my order wrong when ive gone in the mornings which can be a bit of an annoyance  if im in the area and its not busy id drop inby againi ate my first 5 guys burger in columbia sc several years ago during a visit to daughter 1 who was in college at usc five guys is the rage dad we have to go so go we did it was the rage for a reason i really loved the burgers the peanuts and the vibe which was pretty cool for a fast food place i googled 5 guys when i returned home and loved the story of a dad and his 4 sons opening up a burger place and the rest is history   so i was super excited when i read that 5 guys was coming to nola an educated guess is they were in tune with the recent nola burger craze and decided to cash in so d 1 who has since returned to her beloved new orleans and i headed to the concreteness that is clearview pkwy for a nostalgia burger   they did a good job of getting the restaurant to have the same feel as the ones in sc it was packed at lunchtime on a tuesday but the bustle didnt bother me for some reason i consider the burgers to be the best of the fast food class pretty close in flavor and texture to camellia grill the fries can stand up to some of the best in nola no doubt one disappointment was the amount of fries per order in sc i remember ordering a medium fry and getting enough for a family of 4 these orders are tiny and rather pricey overall cost is more than your typical fast food jernt but well worth the extra 3 bucks or so for a lunch for twoget the black and gold  french vanilla and chicory ice cream with hunks of oreos and chocolate chips  they only have it during football season  with inspiration like this it is now wonder why the saints are on a rollconsider this a 35  as a loyal and by loyal i mean dangerously loyal customer of the flying cupcake i hate to be leaving anything less than 5 stars for the record the location of my residence makes this loyalty inevitable as of late ive been disappointed by the new icing methods by this i mean we went from a 40 frosting60 cake to 18 frosting82 cake with the icing not covering the entire surface of the top of the cake how am i supposed to be certain that each bite of my here comes the bride has a dabble of frosting and with that this review has taken a turn for the first world problems categoryi have mixed feelings about this place the sandwiches are delicious but way way overpriced for a chain drive through i got a 12 sandwich in the pick two yesterday and it was tiny like four bites i paid over 12 for half sandwich and half salad i can get an awesome meal at a local restaurant for that or less it also took forever to get through the drive through unfortunately i probably wont go back since boise has so many better optionsim basically addicted to the green curry with tofu if you can handle a little spice you have got to get this dish   also the king soup is fantastic and the nom salad and the coconut soup the mango sticky rice is also fantastic those are the only things i get the fact that its byob is super nice too im giving it 3 stars cuz ive been pretty unimpressed by the noodle dishes but its still one of my favorite places to eat on baltimore avenot a bad burger but not greatfry sauce is good and portions are largebrought my niece and she ordered a chicken salad and it looked pretty sad and appeared to be heated in microwave with the wilted lettuceshe immediately brought it to counter and basically told sorry she did not like but would not give a refund or re make the saladwe were very surprised by their reaction and inability to resolve a no brainier situationcustomer is always wright is not their policy we left without refund or new food replacement and have not been back sinceprob never willif there were an award for the most weirdly situated liquor store in nashville i think they would win it i always imagine that it would be the only liquor store standing in the event of a natural disaster or nuclear war perhaps that is the real intention of this place   to give you an idea its underneath a parking garage in between a kroger and a strip mall i didnt even know it was there until a few months ago and i do have radar for a good wine store   the store isnt bad at all they have a good selection of wine and much better prices than mr whiskers just up the street if you can find it check it outa hipsters paradise the lays potato chips were definitely a miss and the pretzel bun was good but totally unrealistic to think you should eat it like a sandwich it was way too big we sat outside which was nice and i got a french pressed coffee it was greatamazing coffee  but the service sucks on several occasions the baristas have just been overly pretentious to the point of being rude to me and several other customers when i asked about wifi one barista scoffed and said please we dont do that here he laughed looked at the other barista and said she just asked about wifi the other barista then laughed wtf this is a collegetown is it not my boyfriend also told me that the baristas made a sweet old man feel embarrassed about asking for sweetener instead of sugar theyre just a tag team of awful  the one who wears the hat and the vest and the one with an accent   i feel weird saying that id rather go to the starbucks less than a block away over la colombe even studying at the starbucks with sofachairs is way way more comfortable than at la colombe the coffee is definitely expensive but it is quite good i cant give this place 4 or 5 stars because the service is just that obnoxiouscame to reno for 1 night and a friend suggested to try this place the building was big and beautiful i felt like i was at a winery instead   there were options to sit outside or inside we sat inside bc it was slightly hot that day  i rated it a 3 because of the food and drinks we ordered the chicken sandwich which turned out to be tender and juicy loved the avocado touch the side was fries that came with house made ketchup which i loved you can taste some chunks from the tomatoes i ordered a mango ipa which was super smooth compared to regular ipas  whats different here is that the bartender is your server so if the bar is busy it takes longer for them to come to your table for orders we didnt know and waited longer than usual before ordering a friend went up to the bar to order but the bartender had already came to the table food came out fast though  they served craft beers cocktails wine and hard liquor as this is a distillery too wished they sold their crafts in cans thoughif youre going to eat at a conveyor belt sushi place go during peak hours so that the offerings are fresher and more diverse if you wait until after the peak youll end up seeing the same 30 dishes spinning around   mondays at yo are blue plate days where everything on the belt is 350 this can be a great deal if you want to sample a lot of items   the sushi is passable if i hadnt been around international plaza with a hankering for sushi i wouldnt have come here nothing was bad but nothing was especially remarkable   i tried their ramen and the tempura was good but the broth was missing something it felt too light yet was quite salty   service was excellenti have had a couple more meals since writing my initial review and they were definitely improved but they still need to make the overall experience betteri have lived in st louis my whole life and i havent figured out why this is such a hot spot they have okay ice cream and when i go with my family i often dont even get ice cream i much prefer to get something like a brownie or slushee over the ice creamthe pancake pantry is good but its definitely overrated that being said it isnt worth standing in that long line outside for i went with my mom and we both shared the crepes and the sweet potato pancakes our waitress smelled like cigarette smoke which was a major turnoff for me if you go on a weekday before 8 am you can avoid waiting in that outrageous linethe line is long and the service was bad the person who i ordered with forgot my order so my friends finished half of their custard before i got to mine and she was rude about it i dont truly understand the appeal of it all its just vanilla frozen custard with stuff mixed into it  i would prefer just a good old scoop of normal ice cream but in the end it did fulfill my craving for something cold and sweet the portion sizes are enormous i felt kinda sick after i ate it because it was so big and its so creamy and heavy even more so than ice cream is so i recommend sharingschlafly is a longtime favorite  menu has changed a bit monday special was squab  really darn good with mash and kale for 1500  beer had a lot of summer choices along with the normal regulars  not quite as sporty as other breweries but most are real good  great waiter best ive ever had  unlimited tastings of beer other local  establishments are not so generous or accommodating but could take a lesson from them bottleworks is not the same as the taproom  same great beer very different menu  you should try bothdoughnuts were a miss with me but the sliders redeemed them i can see why people dig them i just personally am not a huge fanwe had an extra long wait since the buzzer the host gave us was apparently broken  but we did find some good mojitos at the bar with some nice live music provided by a girl and her guitar   once seated we noticed that much of the seafood was fried  however the food and service were both goodso i dropped in to this store since it was the same company as you would find in hong kong thought it might have the same delicious pastries you would find in hong kong although you did find your egg tarts and sweet buns they werent as  how would you call it fresh they didnt have the same zest as you would find at the little stores along the alley ways of hong kongthey do have egg tarts which will satisfy your craving but doesnt leave you as tickled as you would hope they dont take credit cards by the way and theres a lot of construction going on around them so it looks like theyre closedfor drinkers decent beer selection good tequila variety  i was worried about the recent overhaul with the menu  i suspect ownership has changed but i am not positive  there was no need to worry however in fact i believe that the taco quality has increased especially with respect to the tortillas   the korean bbq is their staple and if youre there for tacos get it it has a great flavor with soft meat i also had the southern fried and though the sauce was delicious the tortillas are flour which is one reason it drops to 3 stars for me i believe heartily in corn tortillas but i thought they were prepped nicely  i couldnt justifiably rate it four stars or above for one main reason your tacos are not madetoorder our orders came out within 2 minutes of ordering them it is impossible to make fresh ingredients or freshly fry a chicken tender for a taco and deliver the tacos at this rate in order to get 4 or 5 stars from me i think the food needs to be made right after i order it that being said dont let this fact deter you from stopping by and satiating your taco cravingi used to visit this place almost every time i visit friendsfamily in stl  its good and is not really any different than stl bread co paneras just a local small business as stl bread co once was  ill echo the generally bad and slow service comments from other yelpers  the manager gave me a disgusted face and retort when i asked if they offered any organic breads menu items or even coffee    the nice local atmosphere earned the 3 star ratingpros diverse menu great atmosphere cons bad parking not enough spots during busy times slow service presumptuous bartends  stopped in here on a slow saturday afternoon  we came in around 2 pm to find more of the lunch crowd had left and there were just a few people having drinks around the bar  we decided to seat ourselves in the bar area and look over the menu  something that turned me off immediately was when i ordered a beer a sour the bartender gave me the youre a girl and definitely wont like this face and suggested i try something else strike one  i had the beer and enjoyed it and did not appreciate someone telling me i might like something else more    their menu looked excellent  there was something for everyone from your weird vegan cousin to your mom who thinks applebees is the epitome of fine dining  everyone is going to find something they liked  i had a delicious sandwhich with some hearty steak fries and my better half enjoyed buffalo chili  one thing i did not enjoy was paying a huge markup for taste of philly pretzels with a side of some notsoyummy pimento cheese dip  ill pass on that next time and wouldnt recommend this app  all in all it was a nice place to have a late lunch and enjoy some brews  the seating in the bar area isnt very comfy no backs on the chairs just stools so dont sit there if youre planning to stay a while   also make sure you ask for your check well before you need to leave  it honestly took over 15 minutes from the time we told the server we were ready to leave to get our check and have our card run  that is too long to wait for something like that especially when the place is only moderately  busyi am going to get a lot of grief for this post but i just dont get the hype i have tried their frozen custard on several occasions and i dont think that they are that great they are incredibly rich and if you can finish an entire small custard you are likely to have a stomach ache i will say they know how to crank out the concretes  if you stop by their shop in south st louis dont be overwhelmed by a line that wraps around the building  in 10 minutes or less youll have your chance to order i prefer frozen yogurt or gelato something a little lighteryummy bagels soup sandwich coffee and breakfast place very friendly staff it was pretty similar to panera bread co just a bit of a smaller local chain id have to go back several times to figure out all the differences i think there would be some advantages to not receiving like frozen ingredients from corporate or something  not exactly my kind of food but it would be good to sit and work or meet up with a friend over coffee always nice for coffee places to have real food options thoughlove their coffee but what a continuing disappointment this place has become as its staff consistenly decides to pack up long before the listedclosing time  so they shut things down or actually wash the floor around you because its not busy  what a way to run a business  we really like their coffee and much prefer it over starbucks but come on more than an hour before closing and everythings cleaned  this has happened so many times we simply wont go back unless its early in the day i wish i had the owners name to tell him what goes on when hes not aroundi have been to the location in philly but this was my first visit here the dcor is modern and spacious but lacks the old school feel of the original our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive the wine list is fare but i would like to see a few more italian wine offerings we started with the fried calamari and it was by far the best in media very fresh with a light breading so you could actually taste the squid the marinara sauce accompanying it was good as well my wife choose the braciole which is a special they have every sunday this was her first time having the dish and it may be her last the meat was a little tough and the stuffing had a somewhat overpowering taste of spices primarily rosemary that threw the flavor off i personally liked it and ended up eating most of it as she ate my chicken parm my dish was excellent the chicken was tender and moist with a very flavorful breading i had a side of gnocchi with it and they were delicious they were cooked just right and were not too dense all in all a great dining experience it seems every time we go for italian in media we end up at fellinis but we will definitely be back to spassothis place is a fun spot off the main broadripple strip  it tends to be a mid30s crowd which is a needed break from the 21 crowd of broadripple  this place feels like it belongs on mass ave or fountain square  i come here for the bread pudding dessert  delicious  although this time they put way too much honey on it which stole the flavor  good beer selection as wellhad a coupon for 1 off so figured id give it a try after walking by it so often veggie regular burrito was good but it was literally rice beans lettuce pico every mexican place ive been to when the veggie option is same price as meat option at least has grilled mushrooms sauteed veggies free quac or something extra so with my 1 it was an ok deal 340  for what i got but probably wont do it again at regular price thought everything tasted fresh but again doesnt make up for making vegetarians having to pay the same price when all you did was take out the most expensive ingredientwell as far as fast food restaurants go i like chickfila but i dont think its anything special  breaded chicken or grilled chicken waffle fries or slaw and salads  i find their menu a little bit lacking and i find the chicken to be rather bland  sometimes the service is a little spotty but not because of inattention by the employees but more because they seem to be understaffed  i like chickfilas business philosophy but im rating the restaurant not the entire businessgood but not great there side orders not as good as i wanted the sliders were good and they should be dont waste your time on the side orders i would order a mixed variety of sliders and determine which is  best for youthe food is the same as any other wendysjust 10xs slower service they seemed to be understaffed for lunch and disorganized the guy taking orders was also handing out food getting drinks and making salads i really felt bad for this poor guy lol  the lady behind me in line started to complain about how long it was taking for the guy to take orders so i reminded her that there was another restaurant acorss the street if she didnt want to wait and that it wasnt the guys fault he was doing the job of three people sighpeople who have never worked in the food industry    in the end the wait was long but not bause of a long menu or people not workingjust very understaffedcame here because i saw they had a checkin offer for a free slush cooler with boba bubble tea while we were next door so we ordered a taro w boba lychee w boba and rainbow jelly and bought a siopao steam bun and ube purple yam   service was goodi guessalthough we did stand at the wrong end of the counter for about 5 minutes before another customer told us we ordered from the other side not sure if employees saw us or not lol the lady at the counter was friendly enough the guy giving us our slush coolers seemed less than enthusiastic   this review is going off just the slush coolers boba tea not as good as other places i feel like there should have been more boba and my taro flavor was not very distinct the lychee one was good though very refreshing and the rainbow jelly was yum unfortunately i did not get to try the ube or siopao we left the ube on the kitchen counter for a few hours while preparing dinner so i think it was my fault i should have put in the refrigerator but when i went to open it and try some it was kind of watery on top and didnt look appetizing my husband who is filipino ate the siopao when he got home from work and said it was just ok  interior is nice and bright modern looking and there seemed to be a good constant stream of customers coming in will definitely have to try some of their food specials and hope to update this review and add some more starsthis is not the easiest place to find since you have to wind your way through the maze of stores in this mall  it has an open and up atmosphere with a guitarist covering songs from the past few years plus the service was good thanks to natalie our server  we had a quick latenight dinner starting with chips and salsa both of which tasted good and were fresh  i ordered the burrito grande with shrimp and my wife had the enchiladas suprema which was a chicken cheese and a ground beef enchilada  both were good and seemed fresh but didnt have the spark we expect with such fare  good in a pinch but not a goto place for a mexican food festok folks is the glass 12 empty or 12 full  problems this place probably hasnt changed since the mid 1900s  evidence submiited  1a  observation   dont ever try ordering online  1b  analysis   why      a  their high tech ordering web interface generates a fax really  a what       b  nobody there ever looks at the fax machine for orders ever    c  funnily they apparently receive some type of automated phone call that they ignore that tells them to look at the fax machine for an incoming web order  maybe morse code would work  2a  observation even calling them ahead doesnt insure you of not waiting in line to pickup a phoned in order  2b  analysis unreal    a  their carryout area deals with customer oneatatime  period   b  case in point      1  last sunday i phoned in an order  seems simple right      2  they asked when i was arriving  lol  more to come      3  two 60s something guys beat me to the door end up in line in front of me           a  first old dude guy orders a side order of spinach  if they have it  csr makes the long trek to confirm they actually do have spinach left  when she returns he asks if they can pour red wine vinegar into it  csr disappears a few minutes later another csr shows up holding a 2 gallon container of red wine vinegar to ensure  this relic really wanted what he asked for  they argue a bit and finally agree  original csr returns he asks for 2 orders of beef tongue off the hot bar that requires another timeburning circuit to ensure they have it  she finally returns and he then decides to order a pastrami sandwich and he wants to know his potato chip choices  they argue about what bread they have what he likes that they apparently dont have in stock    at his point i have one slug in the revolver thats pointed at my head and im spinning it with fervor           b  different csr finally shows up asks second old dude for his order  he wants 2 deviled eggs but is extremely concerned that liquid will drip out and mix  with the creamed herring he wants  they tell him they are in separate carryout containers but hes adamant hes been told that before and that they have showed up together in the past he then parades up and down in front of the cold cut case asking for an 8th of a pound of this and that   at this point im wondering if these guys tunneled and escaped out of a local old folks home  or perhaps a mental institution  3a  observation  they have the best meatloaf on the planet and the portion is huge and comes with 2 side dishes  their vegetables are few and bland but their mac n cheese is a winner has egg in the recipe and a crunchy exterior  two can eat for 22  great sunday fare at a good price  3b  analysis  i might get better carry out service if i fake a heart attack while in line or are wheeled in on a gurney asking for my last meal  they need to handle phone in orders differently as well as their carryout queueing process but also liable is the ancient clientele they attract and thats not liable to change  give this place a shot  when you have an hour to killthis is a great place to go if you need some quick food to sober you up  ive been here many times with my crew after drinking copious amounts in the gayborhood after nbc functions after upenn functions  actually ive never been here sober  i cant really rate it better than ok because im not sure if im remembering via the nostalgia brought on by dirty martinis or horror brought on my shots of patron  i do know i always feel better after leaving  the bread is good and does a drunk tummy wonders  someday ill go back sober  that way i can rate this establishment with a tabula rasa instead of drunk induced admirationpretty decent banh mi we loved the fresh baked bread although wouldve liked it spicier and more acidic the slaw was a bit boring more pate would have been nice as well this is definitely not the place to go for ambiance its a counter tucked inside a convenience store but the food is better than youd think from the atmospheresometimes what i find confusing about yelp is that there is no real effort to separate really old reviews from the new ones and in the case of the daily bread i wonder if thats an important distinction many of the reviews about the poor service and dirty tables seem to be from as far back as 2010 i just havent found that they back up my experience there so far  i generally go for lunch when its the most busy and despite that the orders are taken fast theyve yet to be messed up and the food is prepared fairly quickly they have a decently sized outdoor area which is great  because honestly i have never wanted to spend much time inside ive found that it tends to be kind of cold in there and its often packed to the gills and loud but the outdoor area is quite nice  that said ive liked all of the food ive had the buffalo chicken melt is ok but i was really happy with the various vegetarian options and the smoked salmon sandwich they have some great delistyle sandwiches too theres just a lot of very different options here the ingredients are fresh and things are just paired together well they have a pretty nice soup combo too which is barely more than the individual sandwiches  a friend of mine had some of their frosted cookies too  whoever is decorating them really knows what theyre doing i cant speak of the taste though as ive not tried one  they also have four or more unsweetened ice teas at any given point which is great you dont see that muchelmers great  cookie dessert oh my  friendly bartenders who are often airing their woes behind the bar   burgers were good    i would visit again just not first choiceit seemed like a lucky coincidence that a grilled cheese sandwich craving would hit on the same night the say cheese truck was making an appearance at the south street night market  unfortunately the sandwich that i got after my long wait did little more than quiet the craving  i was psyched to see that the grown up grilled cheese listed on the menu board featured taleggio arugula and jalapenopeach jelly  sadly as i reached the truck a staff member erased the taleggio and wrote in a fairly generic substitution of monterey jack in its place  the event was packed and we were there on the late side so i dont fault them too much for running out of the taleggio  however they kept charging the same price for the sandwich  wth  whatever  i had waited that long i was getting my grilled cheese  i had high expectations and what i received was underwhelming  there was a meager ratio of ingredients to bread the bread was hard and dry the cheese was not melted the whole way through and it seemed like they salted the outside of the sandwich  there were a few bites in the very middle that actually had a reasonable amount of cheese arugula and jelly that made me realize what the sandwich could have been  for a place that calls itself the say cheese truck my grilled cheese should have been more than just acceptable  curiously my husband went with the nongrilled cheese option a roast beef poboy and got a really great substantial sandwich  it was 2 more than the grilled cheese but that 2 got him a lot more food  his sandwich added a star to the review all by itself  i might give say cheese another try  especially if i encounter them outside of the mob scene of a night market  maybe keeping up with the crowd was part of the problemmy trip to pub and kitchen was an unplanned lunch after some hanging in rittenhouse square on a perfect fall afternoon    outdoor seating was a must    i was looking at a menu and it was rather small and read in an unimpressive way    the waiter sold me on a burger which was their special on this day the meat came blended from a high end butcher in nyc  supposedly he had never until now let this blend of meat out of the city  pub and kitchen had exclusivity to this meat which peaked my interest in what can a high end butcher from nyc do that i havent seen before with a burger    the burger came with caramelized onions on a bun  the meat lived up to the height of exclusive beef  although i dont plan on spending 18 for a burger again anytime soon  my tastebuds were more then satisfied  i will describe this meal as i would when i describe the eating experience of any of my favorite foods when the burger was gone i was a little bit sadthis place is alright  they dont have many bakery goods and i did try the ube cake to go  it looks delicious but taste like a regular cake i barely tasted the ubeness  i got the taho i guess im used to the clear very soft tapioca balls in the philippines and not the chewy black ones but the main flaw with the taho was the texture of the tofu  its like lightly firm tofu when it should be buttery soft silken tofu  where it just breaks apart when you slurp it like soup  thats how ive always had it when i was in the philippines of when my mom buys me some in hawaii chinatown  the syrup was on point thoughdistrict is definitely good but its more like eating a piece of cake personal rule if the line is past the tap handles its not worth the wait   the cinnamon roll doesnt get a lot of love but its the best thing on their menu they torch it right before serving to you that and coffee is pretty awesomeit seems unfair to write a review after having been here only once so ill have to go back for round two sometime soon but my initial impression is that this place is okay it certainly wasnt bad but it didnt blow me away perhaps i need to try something other than a plain croissant but at the time what i really wanted was something lunchlike and everything they had as far as i could tell had meat in it something vegetarian along the lines of their turkey sandwich andor ham and cheese croissant perhaps a spinach and feta croissant wouldve been awesome maybe i needed to ask   in any event its a bustling little place and people obviously love it but it seemed that you kind of needed to know what to order since there wasnt a ton on display and there wasnt a list or anything next time ill have to read the yelp reviews and figure out what to ask for the service was solid and friendly the food was good but it was a little overpriced i got the longhorn burger and ordered it medium rare it was very yummy also their large fries is enough to feed two people   their milkshake game is a little weak oh and if you want to have a conversation with someone they play their music a little too loud other than those things its a solid place for groups and it has a quirky atmospheredouble check your order because they are new and unorganized  that said i like spicy chicken and for fast food they do it right  i recommend the spicy fried chicken vs the chicken strips  ill be posting review updates over time because like i said this place is new  glad they moved to the areaunfortunately the delicious food was marred by the terrible service  the waitress we had was perhaps one of the rudest ive encountered in a while  it started when my boyfriend and i decided to order the kolsch which happens to be our favorite beer despite being the cheapest on the menu and in a can  the waitress response when we ordered thisum really  she also asked us 4 times if we wanted a glass with itshe finally brought the beers out with some glasses and asked again if we needed a glass  yes we said again  she then attempted to pour the beer into the glass while it fizzed all over and told us she was a bad at pouring beer  just give me the glass ill pour it myself i told her  good was her response  the food however was delicious  both the mussels and the skate were awesome  i would have stayed for dessert and more drinks if the waitress hadnt brought us over our check immediately after we finished dinner without asking us if there was anything else wed like  ill definitely be back here but avoid the rude waitress sectioni probably will be criticized for saying this but to me the candy was too sweet i know you are saying dude candy is supposed to be sweet it has sugar and i reply yes i know but candy should not be so sweet that you cannot even swallow and then you reply if you dont like it dont go and now we have agreement i wontsushi was good rice was a bit undercooked better than their carson location but when we got seated by the host i let them know i was doing the dinner menu for lunch so i can have a full menu and also let the chef know and everything was great until i ordered dinner rolls i felt like i was being watched by the other chefs about the rolls i ordered and they kept going to talk to my chef in spanish not knowing i spoke spanish saying those are dinner only rolls in spanish i continued with my lunch but definitely didnt like being watched on what i was eating especially if they were speaking spanish so i wouldnt understand thats not very professional and hopefully they learn from situations like thisive been back and forth over this since eating here yesterday  mrs s and i were excited to finally be in the area for dinner as we are huge fans of baileys chocolate bar and figured we would love the range just as much    however we were displeased with our visit  for starters i had been joking about he new trends with bacon flavored deserts and joked about checking the menu for a bacon shake  little did i know there was a bacon shake on their boozy menu  i was feeling adventurous so i ordered this mixture of ice cream caramel candied bacon and makers mark liquor  at 9 it was one of those situations that i generally avoid because 9 for a drink that i know nothing about is a risk i just dont take  and if i ever had any questions of why i dont take these risks the bacon shake did it for me  this shake is tasted in levels  first you get the liquor yummy  thats your first sip ice cream and liquor  next you get the caramel  by the third or fourth drink i was getting chunks of bacon  not so yummy at this point for me it wasnt about the bacon alone  it was the tremendously sweet caramel with the salty yet sweet bacon all mixed into one thing  it was too sweet too much to handle and at 9 too much money to go out on a limb for    for dinner i ordered a bison burger forgot to order cheese with fries and honey mustard sauce  mrs s got a regular burger with fries and cheese sauce  my burger was decent not bad but not the best  mrs s was not as excited about her burger mostly because the ketchup wasnt your every day flavor  i tolerated the different style but i honestly just am not a fan  as for the fries they were good  the cheese sauce was much better than the honey mustard mostly because the honey mustard tasted more like spicy mustard  maybe a mistake was made maybe not hard to say  all in all baileys range was just ok for me and the wife  i am torn between 2 and 3 stars as i write this review for the simple fact that if someone were visiting and asked to go here i would probably suggest passing on it at least if i was expected to be a part of the group and point them in a different direction  i think the most fair review i can give here is 3 stars as part of my issue with baileys range has to do with taste and for me this isnt my style of food  service and atmosphere are both ok as well but really when i think of a 45 star place it should transcend tastes and be inviting for people who usually do not eat a certain style of meal or cooking  baileys does not do this for me  its not exceptional to me  its just ok  so here goes 3 stars for baileys range and a new list for my followers  just not my cup of tea  a fair rating for a place that just isnt my cup of tea but some might still find value in the experience  that seems fair righti tried a corned beef sandwich as i was enticed by a 500 coupon warm on rye the meat was sliced thin so very tender i was impressed with the help yourself pickles which were pretty good but the sandwich was pretty average for a good corned beef on real ny rye baked in store along with house roasted corned beef and others i ll drive a little further south on dale mabry to carrollwood deli the closest thing to a real ny sandwich in tampawith a very varied menu i will be back to try something else as the pickles were worth the tripdisappointing considering how expensive this place is  after living close to it for a few years a friend took me along to meet up with a group there  its just your standard casino but overpriced  i wanted to play some 21 but couldnt find a table for less than 15 a hand with most tables saying 25  im a little cheaper than that  then walking around the casino i was shocked  not much can shock me these days but in 2015 seeing people indoors smoking just seemed weirdlooking for good crayfish this not the place i was sorely disappointed they were small not spicey flavorless  and i had to send them back because they came out cold i was not impressed with raw oysters either a real disappointment for new orleans on the other hand the brussels sprouts coleslaw was quite tastycloser to 35 stars  just had this for lunch  the place was nice looking and clean  the staff was really friendly  i paid 1599 for a fire quacker duck burger and some sweet fries  the burger itself was a little smaller than i had anticipated  it wasnt as flavorful as i thought it was going to be either  it wasnt even remotely spicy  the duck was cooked very well though and tasted good  ive had better sweet fries    i think i will try this place again though i really want to try the duck bacon or brisket on a burgeri have been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally had a chance last week do not let the fact that this is a food truck with tables and awning dissuade you from going the food is good i had the carne asada tacos and the carne asada caramelo which were good my friend had the cabeza tacos which were also good it was a little crowded but the food was served quickly it is outside so keep in mind the temperature when you gothey also have sonoran hot dogs but we decided to try them next timegood food my son loves the lamb owner super friendly and visited our table very clean lots of seating we enjoyed iti went for lunch during the week wednesday with my friend peter i was really excited to try this cypriot food he got the spanakopita and i got ground lamb with pine nuts on flatbread i think it was called lacham azeen both came with a few mouthfuls of a side salad  the food was tasty  hot came out quickly and the portions were perfect for lunch  service was decent the waiter was very practiced and tried to be funny i would have preferred he had been better about keeping the water glasses full instead of disappearing outside every few minutes he was however very solicitous and offered recommendations  the decor is nice the walls are painted white the touches of blue and the ambient light give it a very mediterranean feel which i suppose is what theyre going forthis place is a bit expensive for fast food and the portions arent too generous but if youre in a hurry and youre walking home from a night class this may be your best bet its open most weeknights until 11 pm  lunch items arent served until 11 am  if you go any earlier youre stuck with bagels i believe theyre called squagels by virtue of the fact that theyre squarish and not circular and other items i dont really consider to be real food  i tried the jalapeno and cheddar squagel on two occasions  i ordered cream cheese with it and it was fairly tasty to my sleepdeprived 7 am slightly offgame taste buds  the asian chicken salad was acceptable and the piece of bread it came with was fairly good and added value to the meal  the chain also offers a 12salad 12sandwich combo which is a convenient though obvious idea i usually get the tuscan pesto chicken since its the least offensive and least messy of the sandwiches ive ordered here the chicken tinga sandwich is a bit messier  the guacamole and stringy chicken bits tend to spill out of the sandwich when you bite into it and i order a salad with it  ive never gotten a soup here    the coffee is acceptable if not memorable  the brownies and cookies dont exactly taste homemade but if the mood strikes you theyre available    going back to the sandwiches  order them raw not toasted since the toasted bread is crunchy and hard  also the tuscan pesto chicken tastes better without melted cheese  the latter ruins an otherwise quasihealthy meal  ive never gotten the carrots with a sandwich but ive opted for the pepperflavored kettle chips  raw carrots dont particularly appeal to me  for beverages i do recommend their lemonades mojito lemonade or raspberry lemonade albeit theyre full of empty calories    service b taste bit wasnt great but it wasnt bad the food was good i had a ham and cheese griller so you really cant mess that up my mom had a club and my sister had a wrap the wrap had honey mustard even though my sister said no honey mustard but i dont know if i can blame the cook or the waitress   our waitress wasnt the greatest she was a little slow and when we asked her what the soup of the day was she forgot to come back and tell us when she did remember she couldnt remember what the soup was today it was cream or something maybe crab or maybe corn and something vegetable im not kidding that is what she said now as i am allergic to seafood they are very different soups   the prices there are pretty reasonable for the three of us it was about 30 bucks i will admit i have been there for breakfast and that was much betterthe more and more i go to gastropubs the less and less impressed i am by them i dont know if the schtick is just getting old or if people are doing a worse job or what but cmon people entertain me  pub and kitchen strikes me as a fairly run of the mill entry into the gastropub arena very nice interior rehab job check pretty awesome selection of beers check couple fancy gourmetish items on the menu check yawn the thing missing was something to separate this place from the crowd why would i go here instead of any other place just like this jonny brendas has whiskey donuts the tap room has tacos of the day the royal has one of the better burgers around not to mention innovative uses of pork that surprise me every time mmmm pulledpork nachos with beer cheese sauce  i digress this place had  18 dollar fish and chips 18 bucks seriously for fish and chips maybe you shouldve saved some money on the fancy interior so you could serve some food for a reasonable price listen up pub and kitchen and you too devils den if i wanna spend 40 dollars on dinner im not going to a gastropub not when there are better dinners to be had for 40 pick your byob or much cheaper gastropubs with the same food i dont get the 20 dollar entree movement in these places it really makes no sense  one other irk our waiter was nice but he had to have come to our table like 45 times during the course of the meal body language my friend it will tell you all you need to know like when we are done with our menus see putting down menu when i need another drink see drink close to or completely empty this aint rocket science homey update as i read through all the other reviews bad service is a recurring theme  if you live near pub and kitchen or are in the area hit it up itll be a fine dinner but i dont think its worth traveling very far at all to go to this placenot bad but not out of this world city limits is a popular breakfast spot in bellevue with a roomy interior outdoor seating a large array of coffees and friendly employees  the extensive menu offers a number of options and specializes in the banini various paninistyle sandwiches framed by a bagel on paper the huevos rancheros banini seems like the winner with pepper jack cheese egg and bacon and my favorite condiment on the planet jalapeo cream cheese all between an everything bagel but there wasnt that spicy kick i had hoped for reasonably flavorful but not the heat i anticipated the bagel was blander than most ive eaten which really surprised me because its hard to mess up an everything bagel  the southern banini was better with egg bacon and cheddar cheese but the most significant difference was the flavorful sausage offsetting the blandness of the sesame seed bagel would i eat here again sure if i were meeting someone for breakfast but i wouldnt go two blocks out of my way to eat here quite frankly when im in the bellevue station strip mall im heading straight for legendary pizza perfectsolid not going to complain i mean they are doing it bringing pho to mainstream america well ucsb that is  i wish they were here when i attended ucsb but better late than never    i had the pho tai and if you are craving pho then this may satisfy your craving  however i prefer my thin slices of meat rare and thin  my noodles were a bit limp and i like my bean sprouts crisper  i also would have loved me some more jalapeno limes and thai basil  cant get enough of the thai basil  my sister got her usual bowl and wow that was amazing  i would definately reccommend that  ban cha gio tom thit nuong a lovely medley of rice noodles egg roll grilled shrimp choice of pork or chicken served atop of lettuce cucumbers bean sprouts cilantro crushed peanuts and served with a ddipping sauce containing fish sauce im guessing  solid  its also called the 32 in case you are wondering  this bowl is bursting with flavors  my sister got the pork and it was tender and full of flavor  addiciting  the 2 young men behind the counter were very sweet and lovely  although im more of a salty girl but when it comes to vietnamese coffee i go all out  give me the 2 inches of condensed milk   they go light here maybe just looking out for you  yeah a bit pricey for a vietnamese joint but id rather spend 10 bucks on a meal here then spend 7 at a drive thru  much better for you and go ahead and titilate your senses  you can alwasy douse your pho with siracha or hoisin saucetasty crowded picturesque  on a pier with multiple selections of seafood restaurants we chose this one based on the reviews heed the warning from other patronsthe location is small and there is a considerable waiting list for a table since we were interested in the food and not so much how we eat it we ordered from the side window and ate our food on the outside patio tables i ordered the cioppinno served in a bread bowl  the flavor was delicious and there was plenty of seafood including a rock crab claw blue crab legs shrimp scallops and mussels my only problem with this dish was the awkward way in which i had to eat it without a shell cracker for the rock crab and how messy the soup was served in the bread bowl 8 napkins were not enough to keep my hands clean as i ate im assuming that if i tried the food served in the restaurant it might have been a little smoother my husband ordered the crab cakes and they were goodmore ran than cake which is always a plus id like to give this place another shot when im in santa barbara and see if there is a difference with the dinein experiencevery good coffee love the chai latte here excellent soups most of the pastries ive tried were great customer service is hit and missmore hits than misses if youre short on time go somewhere elseyeah i know you never knew this place had a name well it does and you best learn it this is basically a satellite of taqueria veracruzana to me for what is awesome mexican food without a nice cold beer just awesome mexican food  my circle of friends call this place the grime or  the beer garden or the hockey arena youll have to actually go to figure the last one out they do have  i believe the cheapest six pack of yuengling lager in the hood and some of the drunkest mexicans youll ever see this place has served me well for the last few years just dont take your girlfriend along unless you like fighting the owners name is sonny hes nicethis is the first place we opted to eat seafood in santa barbara and it was not too shabby we walked to the restaurant from our hotel which was a bonus taking in the atmosphere of the wharf on a chilly night certainly got us into the santa barbara mood even once we arrived the small bar style dining and aroma of the days catch inside the place was in line with the image one conjures up when thinking of fresh seafood  after a very brief wait we got a seat looking directly at the kitchen and let me tell you the staff have this operation down to a science they are moving people in and out of the restaurant at record speed all without sacrificing service our waiter was friendly and helpful and we never once felt rushed in fact this was a highlight for us even when selecting our beverages he let us sample beer and made recommendations on wine   we ordered all of our food at once as wed had a chance to peruse the menu and take a few tips from yelp we ordered a glutenfest including a cup of clam chowder a half dozen oysters some coconut shrimp and the shrimp and scallop linguine  the clam chowder arrived first and it was a bit bland i really wanted to like it since the weather was ideal and they add bacon in every batch  but it was lacking something adding the oyster crackers helped but i would recommend skipping this if you are in a soup mood maybe try the soup of the day they had a bisque and that might have been a better option   the oysters arrived next and that was the biggest letdown for me i am an oyster junkie  ive been known to eat four dozen in one sitting im also an oyster purist meaning i add only a tiny bit of lemon before eating them so they maintain their sea flavor the presentation was sloppy  just ice on a plate which was melting and wet our eating area a measly slice of lemon and lime cocktail sauce and a little horseradish the oysters themselves just werent that good and for the first time in my life i left two on the plate when it went back  the coconut shrimp and linguine arrived together and they were both quite good you know how sometimes when you get coconut shrimp they seem to be lacking coconut these babies were loaded with it and were large in size to boot i think i bit into the tail on every shrimp i ate on account of the batter being so delicious the onion ring garnish was also amazing maybe its just the fact that i dont eat gluten often but the batter on everything was outstanding  the linguine was pretty good as the seafood was tender and the noodles were just past al dente the sauce was a little too white winey for me but my boyfriend loved it maybe it felt like too much because i was already drinking a glass of sauvignon blanc  all in all i think this was a three and a half star dining experience admittedly the biggest disappointment was likely my own elevated expectations yelp reviews caused me to believe that the food would be spectacular and id say it was just good seeing the aquariums of crab was also sad as they were overcrowded and all trying to escape maybe ive just seen finding nemo too many times but i couldnt watch them watching the chef however was fun and the shellfish coming off the grill looked delicious its possible that we just didnt order the right thing so we will likely go back once more during our stay to try their specials and the lobster tacosawesome hole in the wall  food was banging  service friendly  lot of good reviews from neighborhood locals  so had to try it out  the stoner burrito is the real deal yomy visit to nook was quite pleasant the service was super but the food was just okay i had high hopes for this diner but i was let down by the quality of the food i got the paleo pizza and the crust was very dry and didnt hold its shape the flavor was good but i probably would not get this a second time overall i enjoyed the experience but i wasnt a fan of the paleo foodmy wife and i dropped in tonight for dinner i prefer the authentic menu items and my wife prefers the americanized  menu  both choices  are good in general the food is very good  the downside is that the service really sucks the staff is running around in a near chaos state there is no organization if the service was better we would  return more oftenmy coworkers and i were on our way to five guys at lunch when we remembered that this place had just opened so we rerouted and queued up in its slightly out the door line the line around 1215 was considerable it probably took 15 to 20 minutes before we exited with our food to go so how was it my experience was slightly tainted by an order mixup when i got back to my office i found that although i ordered the 500 burger i was missing lettuce and tomato the bacon however present was pretty chewy id prefer it much crispier the burger itself was cooked to order and the combination of burger brioche roll and cheddar really came together nicely i inhaled it i also accompanied this small wonder with the truffle fries they were delicious the truffle taste came through in every bite but they were incredibly salty for the rest of the day i staggered back and forth to the water cooler to quench my thirst like a man walking through a desert that also has a water cooler in it this place has some potential and id definitely try it again but im not sure if id eat here any more than once a month for those looking for a miniature version of the fabled rouge burger there is one distinction the rouge burger is topped with divine gruyre cheese while the 500 burger is only available with swiss provolone cheddar or american other than that the burger is pretty much the same except about 14 the size or less brioche buns are keythis review is based on the deli side only the pastry side is delicious 5 stars  great pies and donuts ok back to my review   i got a hoagie today yes eat gud makes hoagies now  the price was reasonable  499 for a 6 inch hoagie with a small side salad i got potato salad which was tasty the roll was stale which wasnt like eat gud since their bread is usually fresh and they were sold out of french baguettes i got londonport roast beef which was tasty but was lacking in quantity  they weigh out their meat to only 3oz of meat for 1 meat per sandwich  they use boars head meat which i prefer but for some reason  the majority of sandwich shops in hamilton dont carry so all in all good tasting meat but not enough of it  hopefully on my next visit they get rid of their weighing out policy and provide more meat also i hope they have a fresher roll selection for hoagiestonight we went to the shlafly brewery for supper i had a salad called green and grain with ranch grilled chicken  i am very pleased with my choice a full plate nicely arranged and the quianno was a great addition to the saladenjoyed the servicecute and helpful wait staff the food was very goodordered mostly apps glad we dropped inwould come backhad dinner here on a gorgeous night  we had to take advantage of the weather and sit outside we were told it would be a 45 minute wait for a table so we had a few drinks at the bar 7 cocktails this new yorker needs to travel  who am i kidding  anywhere to get her affordable liquor fix i ordered the mint julep but really didnt like it the bartender swapped it out for the strawberry sangria for free spreading the love in philly  the sangria was much tastier i had been craving mussels all day and so was thrilled to see them on the dinner menu big mistake  these mussels were in a hefeweizen broth the flavor was awful the color of the broth was murky and make me frightened to dip my bread and once i mustered up the courage it didnt even taste good soooo very disappointing meal my friends were perfectly satisfied with their own selections so im just going to chalk it up to poor selection on my part but if the word pub is in the name of your restaurant shouldnt you do a good job with mussels three stars for the cheap and tasty alcohol this is supposed to be the innout of the midwest meh i think i was just expecting a lot more since innout is what i had always heard as the comparison but that doesnt even come close to true as a bicoastal resident of both cali and indy i am privileged to eaten at both places many times for many years and five guys although a step up from mcdonaldswendys is nothing more than just an average fast food burger joint the fries are not anything worth writing home about and the peanuts are kinda weird i have been to this location many times and i have always had great service thats what the 3 stars are for and the food is fine it just aint no innout but this is a good location for sure they are clean friendly and fastgreat service and friendly staff highly mediocre food calamari undercooked and doughy spaghetti bolognese tasted like chef boyardi world there needs improvementcame here to try a frozen coffee since it was in the area we were shopping i got the mocha frappe which was okay i wouldnt drive distances for it the atmosphere is decent for a cafe but based on how big it is youd think it would be busier i will say that my dad usually picks up birthday cakes from here and they are pretty delicious especially the birthday cake with the fruit overall dont really expect great coffee but definitely try some dessertsinexpensive lunch combos fresh and tasty nothing to write home about thoughdrinks we had were great our server was outgoing and friendly this would be a great place to stop by for some drinks or desert but the food was seriously disappointing i ordered the friday special enchiladas la bamba which turned out to be just a really plain taco casserole on top of tortilla chips really nothing special about it at all my date ordered the chicken pesto which turned out to be the type of frozen chicken with the grill lines painted on it as i said the food was a major disappointment and i would not recommend it but the drinks were good and the atmosphere was nice and appealingi have been using castrillos for years and i think they have gotten under new ownership in the last 6 months and i dont like it as much crap i mean i really want to i do i even tried again the other day and i was just underwhelmed   i dont think the sauce is all that good any more and i have gotten some soggy dough a few times this last time the pepperoni so so over cooked it had hardened and started to shrivel i didnt even finish one piece   so whomever bought this business needs to call the old owners and find out their secrets and go back to the way it was because that was working for me and this is just not even closei stopped by greko to pick up food on the way home so this was a to go order the counter service is great everyone is really personable which is a definite plus i noticed that the owner was even kind enough to assist someone possibly homeless by giving them something to eat this added the third star   my experience i ordered the greek salad and added the lamb  the salad ingredients were fresh if sparse i was able to count the number of cucumbers and tomatoes and kalamata olives the addition of the fried chickpeas was nice my salad was completely missing feta cheese  i did call back and let them know that my salad was missing feta i only received an apology  that was by far my biggest disappointment my total with tax was over 15 there was not enough food to justify this and while the quality was great i was definitely still hungry   i also didnt love that they chop the lamb up before putting it on the salad i am probably one of those rare individuals that would rather they leave it sliced    i really want them to do well but fear that these serving sizes and price might prevent some from trying it outmade a stop here one afternoon for an addition to my hard rock tshirt collection the tshirts here are a little different in that the logo in the middle of the shirt is purple instead of yellow and it fades pretty badly after you wash it once  i went to the food court and got something to eat and it was basically like you average mall food court i looked around some and i thought that the casino itself was pretty nice but probably not as good as vegas if you are sensitive to cigarette smoke i would stay out of here this place reeks of it but thats to be expected in a casino in my opinion and it didnt bother me that much  i agree with some of the other reviewers in that it did look like a good place to party if i would have discovered this place ten years ago i could have gotten into a lot of trouble here lolpeople smoking in the bar bar games jumbo jenga shuffle board corn hole give it a try  i dont know if it is a st louis thing but i havent seen the words douche bag and douchey in so many reviews before maybe it fits i thought it was oki love the food and drinks here ive never had anything i didnt like my favorite is the grilled cheese mixing apples and cheese is my favorite so this sandwich is a hit for me the decor is awesome as well very unique and and fun what i find really disappointing is the service the past few times ive been in ive had the same male server who has been less than stellar we wait maybe 10 minutes to give an order waited 30 minutes for our first drinks and then another 20 for the check i would have loved to order a couple more drinks and maybe some desert but waiting on the server 30 minutes per drink is something i dont have time for the other staff seemed to be working really hard and even helped us out a little when our server was no where to be found i wish i would have had one of them insteadstopped in and had a nice gyro the help was friendly you can taste the espresso in the iced mocha and they make their bakalava i took some to go and havent had it yet  lots of egg combinations for breakfast were offeredwhen freddys opened i couldnt get enough i think i went once or twice a week the months after it opened they serve match stick fries chicken burgers melts hamburgers and hotdogs my favorite is the freddys frozen custard i cant get enough its addicting for me i see the monthly special flavors and just love every one i especially love when they blend in the toppings to make a concrete and this i will go through their drive through to get the are thick and as good as it gets i would give this place a 5 out of 5 in the dessert category    however the food is ok its fresh and hot  i just dont care for their style of burger nor their match stick fries so the thought of eating of meal there would for me just be a means to an end to get dessert i will profess im a picky fry person  a huge plus at freddys are its staff they are always friendly and polite the space is open and good for people with mobility issues also the location is clean and there is plenty of parking so its got a lot going for ita little overhyped but solid overall the wait can be a bit much being that its located on the pier with tons of tourists enjoyed the food nothing really bowled me over but i enjoyed myself dont think ill be back but thats mostly because of the long wait the staff was terrificthe food was very tasty but spicy  im not really a fan of indian food so im not a great judge of this stuff but i think it was pretty good  very well done but unbearably spicy  the only items not spicy were the white rice pita bread and vegetable pakora  aside from the food the people were very friendly  and the lunch buffet was 899 which was fair  my main complaint is the state of the restaurant the interior is outdated and dark and the exterior is shady but the atmosphere is comfortablei would say this is not the best bbq in tampa but its not bad if your in the mood and in the area there is no place to sit and eat so its pretty much drive up walk up and order your food this is pretty much two trailerout buildings set up roadside as for the food ribs are fall off the bone but not really that much flavor no dry or wet rub placed prior to smoking and heck anything can become fall off the bone if you leave it on the smoker along enoughi dont mean this to come off that harsh but i am trying to be honest i prefer my bbq to have some sort of bark on the exterior with a noticeable smoke ring this bbq is absent of the bark and only a light smoke ring as for the sides they are just a ok in my opinion the beans say out inside individual packaged containers so there room temp dry and thick the macaroni salad was the same lukewarm and bland i guess in a pinch it fits the bill but if your in the mood for some finger licking bbq you might want to look elsewhereservice was a little lacking but food was definitely 5 stars we came in at what appeared to be shift change so the waitress that seated us seemed annoyed the homemade sourdough and jelly was amazing i ordered the california dreamin and absolutely enjoyed it would definitely go back for food quality but the 3 star rating is for the service qualityburgers are a tinge overcooked the only available toppings are bacon and cheese carson location and others offer fried eggs fries were soggy but the homestyle vanilla coke was the redeemerits ok pretty good pizza friendly service great decor and convenient location   the pizza  i was here for late lunch and decided to order the lunch special  a slice of cheese pizza salad and soft drink for 800 you can add whatever toppings you desire for 050 each not a bad deal i ordered the salad with raspberrywalnut vinaigrette dressing and a cheese pizza with italian sausage the salad was brought out with my drink it was a generous serving of lettuce tomato red onions and fabulous crunchy croutons the salad was good but nothing outstanding it was also served heaped on a small plate keeping it on the plate while i ate was a bit difficult   the pizza came out in about 20 minutes it was a huge slice of thick crust type pizza which is not my favorite it was also so large and the the crust so thick i had to eat it with a knife and fork shudder the overall taste was bland and with the thick crust it all was a bit dry the sausage was crumbled and uninspiring   the interior is funky and cute and clean the blue walls and touches of art and blousy curtains give it a pleasant friendly hippy feeling that is welcoming and casual   i think i would give it another try and order a personal size pizza with one of the special combinations they also have a nice selection of beers in addition to soft drinksit must be good because theres always a line i would say if you can walk right in and eat its worth the wait otherwise i wouldnt stand in line  im an regular pancake sort of guy no fancy pancakes just pancakes eggs and ham  mine breakfast was good but not over the top  my wife had the cooks medley  again it was good but nothing super special  we were told by a nice couple that the sweet potato pancakes were the deal  maybe next time  service was good they have water  coffee while youre waiting  we were told the lines were shortest before 9 and after noon  i would say if your visiting have time on your hands and want to do something nashville come on  good people watching and chatting with the neighbors in line if you want something more unique theres probably more unique finds in nashville  you can get larger groups in here if you want  also there were lots of kids  really built for groups of 4 or 6i cant give this place 4 stars because the burrito i ordered steak was just ok  for 7 it was bland and light on the meat  however the place is called indy tacos for a reason other then a hopeless lack of creativity  the taco i ordered was terrific  the mole which is a flavor that can easily be mutilated taco was amazing  finally an authentic taco in indiana  it was packed with fresh tasty ingredients and the sauce was fantastic  i will go back and try the other tacos if i can get past the mole skipping the steak of course  2 to 3 tacos would make for a filling lunch which is cheap in my bookthis is a tough review for me  i love donuts growing up a lit hot now sign followed by a warm krispy kreme donut was a favorite scenario of mine rightfully so yeast donuts have always been my favorite until i grew older and couldnt deal with the excessive sweetness and converted to an occasional cake donut    i heard all the rave about this place when i moved here and i just knew i found the perfect way to satisfy my donut crave without being too sweet like krispy kreme or too dense like dunkin i think hearing everyone else talk so much about it clouded my judgement and i just thought they were the best hands down after that excitement wore off i returned and i was able to think on my own how i felt about them   as for the donut itself i could go without its dry and not usually what i think of as a real donut in my opinion when it comes to taste not yeasty but also not cakey its definitely its own breed   what keeps me coming back however are the toppings these guys are always making up the best flavor combos using just about anything u can think of as inspiration they post the donut lineup of the day on their instagram every morning so you know which they are offering on that day between the varieties of the flavors along with their levels of sweetness everyone is sure to find something they like   they have an entire menu outside of the donuts though usually 3 slider options for the day your usual coffee drinks and teas plus soda and juiced veggies   they do have wifi and indoor as well as 2 outdoor seating locations i love the open kitchen and hearing the buzz of all the customers in and out definitely a place to at least try oncea friend and i found this little cafe on our way back to the hotel one afternoon and decided that we should keep it in mind to try out before we left  turns out we went there the very next morning for a well needed hangover cure before a lengthy day of sight seeing and an even longer night of roaming around bourbon street    the menu is listed on huge black chalkboards above the counter where you order although if you dont feel like craning your neck backwards and squinting from your spot in line you can find a paper copy close to the entrance or left on tables  its your typical cafe menu bagels omlettes breakfast platters etc with a slight french twist to some dishes ie you can order a fresh croissant instead of toast  the prices arent too bad eitherabout 6 or 7 bucks for a breakfast platter 2 or 3 bucks for a special coffee  the line can get pretty long but i dont see it as the kind of place with a line out the door as there are tons of other similar cafes splattered all over the french quarter  you have to order at the counter take your number card and try to find a place to sit  the turnover in this place is pretty quick so it shouldnt be too hard to find a seat and you can always move tables if necessary  if you dont want to eat there i think you can also get the food to go  since the place is small its easy to feel very crowded in there when the line is long so i recommend sitting by the door if you can snag a spot makes it feel a little more open  i got a breakfast platter with eggs hash browns bacon and a croissant instead of toast  the eggs were fine i dont like yolk so i only order the whites and its very hard to mess those up  the hash browns were great shredded and greasy maybe a little too greasy with random bites of crispy potatoes mixed in the croissant was okit was supposed to be warm and buttered but it was more like a crispy flaky mess with a spot of butter  sadly the bacon was greasy and limp instead of nice and crispy like i expected i ate it anywayyou can never turn down bacon  my friends ordered similar platters which came out looking a lot like mine    overall the food was a little greasy for my taste but it did the jobthats a shame  this place is full of junkies customers  the staff and the service is fast  its just too much like homeless or you can tell the addict people all coming here and solicitingso i normally love this place but today not so much ordered 2 bowls the same except one fish change and mine was missing ingredients and looked like a darn mess as compared to the other bowl consistency is keythis is at least my 6th or 7th trip to danny boy beer works and nothing changes i love the craft beers and the place itself they have 2 great patios  one sunny and one in the shade but my problem is the service we went on sunday and after sitting at a table for about 5 minutes i went up and ordered beers at the bar from the bartender  i grabbed menus and after sitting with our beers for another 5 to 10 minutes i was able to flag down a waiter we ordered an appetizer the appetizer was brought and i was told that he would return in a minute with plates and napkins never happened we finished the appetizer and ordered another beer from the waiter we were never asked if we wanted more food or water although i saw other tables with glasses and pitchers of water on them in fact he walked by us with a pitcher of water twice to get my check i had to go back to the bar and ask the bartender to ring it out  if this were the first time maybe i would be kinder unfortunately it is not often you cant tell if there is wait staff or not so go for the great beer try a take me to church but be prepared to get it yourselfthe last time i visited this place was very disappointing the disappointment came from unfriendly service and the desserts  my friend ordered a seasonal peppermint hot chocolate and when it arrived it didnt taste of peppermint when she mentioned this to our server the server seemed annoyed when she brought it back they hadnt topped it with more whipped cream this made the product look sloppy and like the kitchen didnt care  like they just put a few drop of syrup in it and sent the mess back out also basically any time we said anything to our server she looked annoyed no fun  while their carrot cake and root beer float are pretty decent the other desserts are pretty disappointing ive also tried their chocolate tart it was good but the serving was so small and while theyre known for their bread pudding it is no where near my favorite in town   this place is nice for lunch when you just want a simple soup and salad and hopefully your server is in a better mood than mine wasthought a little over priced they had issues day we went couldnt get in beechwood aging section giving bud light hat when ive been drinking budweiser for 40yrs for 35 should been given choice between bud and bud light hat gave bud light hat awayour visit to baileys range was a bit of a disappointment  it was our first dine in experience here we were looking forward to it  we had got an ice cream to go once previously and wanted to try dining in after we saw the cool atmosphere  so on a luch break we tried a dine in  we got sat right away even though they were slightly busy  we got our order in right away  we ordered the burgers well done which we regretted due to them being overdone and very dry  however the flavor combinations of both burgers were quite tasty  our server was really slow and not because she was busy with other tables  she just took extremely long to get anything we needed like more napkins drink refills and our food  she quickly picked up the bill to cash out our payment though  she also was a bit rude in her service to us  it was lunch time we were short on time so it felt too long of a visit over one hour to get some burgers and fries  we got our ice cream to go again as to get done on time  on the plus side our servie at the ice cream station was very quick and super friendly  we have agreed to try to dine in one more time before we give up on this place so hopefully it will be better  peacethe service is great and the staff are very friendly but i was very disappointed in the serving sizes of the adult beverages most beer bars restrict serving sizes around 11 abv but anything over 8 gets served in an 8oz glass at the price of a pint their bloody marys are  phenomenal all 6oz of them finally i understand that people love their pets but restaurants are not the place for your little yorkie in a basket that you continue to feed under the table if you disagree this is the place for you a service animal is one thing and completely acceptable but be considerate of other patrons this isnt petsmarttypical diner fare layout similar to most of the philly and south jersey diners menu options were nice  went with the roast port sandwich with broccoli rabe they brought it without long hots which just wasnt going to work for me luckily they were able to get some for me and i did really enjoy the sandwichburger up is our favorite restaurant my wife and i eat there probably more than any other restaurant weve always been to the 12 south location but after seeing a movie at the carmike thoroughbred we decided to try the cool springs burger up   to preface i want to say the service decor and even the food was all good butit wasnt the same as the 12 south burger up the aioli had a bit of a corn syrup taste and the woodstock my wife and i shared had a tinge of a sloppy joe like taste none of these made the food bad but the same items at the 12 south location tasted more refined overall of a higher quality that being said the cool springs locations features some menu items not found in 12 south we enjoyed the fried green beans and if i werent full from popcorn and soda from the movies i wouldve loved to have tried a milkshake   tldr great vibe and decor but the food just wasnt the same as the original locationhere on business and ate at this restaurant twice i am being generous with 3 stars because the food was ok as expected service was good on the first visit and thats why the 3 food was good both times on the second visit had very poor service from my waitress they were busy it was saturday night the attitude of my server when i had my meal served with the wrong type of chicken was thats what you ordered it was not she exchanged it quickly and was short when i paid its a thankless job but telling a customer even at jrs its your fault will be why i wont go backwent here for a coworkers birthday today for lunch loved the overall atmosphere and ambience i ordered the asian chicken salad and tomato basil soup which was the soup of the day the soup was excellent will definitely order again and i actually wished i had ordered the big bowl on to the salad very good as well love the textures and flavors in it only problem was the chicken i really cannot describe to you what was wrong with it because i cannot quite put my finger on it i just found myself eating around it  maybe mine was just a fluke i am not sure  if i decide to try it again i will just omit the chicken from the salad   and last but not least the reason i am writing this review 2 of my coworkers ordered the mediterranean  flat bread pizza amazing i immediately regretted not ordering it if you like veggie pizza you cannot go wrong and for all you vegetarians it is one of the few options you have here i liked it so much that i ordered one to go i admit it did not taste as great the next day i will be back but i will go for happy hour next time my coworker raved about the mixed drinks so much that i have to see for myselfa quaint oldstyle southern restaurant  i had the brownie sundae sugar coma and hubby had a malt  we got there just at closing  a lady was playing a piano and came by our table to ask for song requests   i read that the place used to be a drug store on the ground floor and a hospital on the 2nd floorbuilt in 1898   its got charming atmosphere and the desserts are hand made not shipped inits a nice local neighborhood joint acts a kind of a neighborhood hub good cookies which is key good sandwichs and i am told the soup is good too although i have never had it breakfast or lunch youre good either waynashville doesnt have a lot of international markets   i love diverse and ethnic food my husband is peruvian and in order to make his traditional dishes we need things like aji amarillo aji panca or other classic peruvian specialties there is a lot you can find at this store  whether you need chinese mexican asian japenese or anything inbetween its a great store to pick  up canned or packaged products   with saying that i would warn on the quality of meats or seafood we typically get tripe at different stores and the tripe there was frozen and yellow i have seen packages of beef look extremely brown or fish smell even a lot of the shellfish is completely opened up or dead which shows the conditions for keeping it fresh arent up to standardi wish there was a gets the job done option  it was serviceable food good price subpar service  i feel like carryout is the way to go  the inside is beautiful and clean but service is not great  i was nearly finished with my hot and sour soup before they brought our drinks and then only because i asked for them again  the food was ok good sized portions not the most delicious i have had but tasty  i love general tsos and this version was alright but too much ginger flavor for me and not at all spicy the chicken was all white meat but very overcooked and some pieces were pretty tough  but you got a large portion with chicken fried rice for less than 8  i might get carryout on the way home but i dont see going back to dine in anytime soonsince toppers is near my office when we decided to order lunch in a few days ago i decided to try a new pizza place we settled on a thin crust veggie pizza cheesy stix and hot wings for three of us plus extra to share they delivered exactly at their estimated time we all liked it  nothing too exciting but definitely good my one coworker found a few hairs on one of his slices that didnt appear to be any of ours so that was kind of gross but it happens i suppose since everything else was otherwise good id go backi have dined here many times probably never on a tuesday the food was bland and thoughtless  i have had the pasta and fagioli many times and never been so disappointedhope you try harder next timewell we have been to bjs twice now so here is what we think  the good bjs has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long  the bad bjs has a very broad menu selection with a menu that is twenty pages long  bjs is one of those restaurants that cannot decide if it is a steakhouse a brew house an italian restaurant a pizza parlor a rib joint or a burger place as is so frequently the case with restaurants that try to do so many things it ends up not doing any of them very well the servers seem to have a lot of trouble answering questions because there is such a massive amount to remember frequently they have to pass such tough questions as can i get that with mushrooms on to the kitchen manager who appears to be in a black hole from which your server may never return  on to the food first visit we had salmon which had a very nice flavor but was a bit over cooked this time we first ordered calamari as an appetizerwhich was nicely battered and fried with good marinara and horseradish dipping sauces we then both ordered the rib eyes each medium rare the cooking was fine the quality of the meat was terrible we have been around a good while and these were the toughest most gristly rib eyes we have ever eaten or at least tried to eat when we arrived home rex the amazing wonder dog ended up eating most of them he thought they were great then again he eats cat litter  grandson had a burger and fries which he gave his 8 year olds thumbs up to if the ketchup on his face was any measure both must have been good  beer selection was wide but not more than the average brew house  so all in all a great big mediocre for bjs if you are in the area of the outlet mall in wesley chapel there are numerous other places to choose from think about them think about them hardnot the best chinese food ive ever had but not the worst either  this place is alright  i love the fried donuts they have for a dollar  they are so delicious and come out piping hot  i also enjoy their crab ragoons and hot and sour soup  the fried rice left much to be desiredthe one and only sushi place to get your sushi fix in iv ive been here a handful of times when ive been too lazy to go to sushi ahi at the marketplace its never crazy busy and you get your order within 15 min if theres no one else around which seems a bit much but i have enough patience to wait im not that adventurous when it comes to sushi but i have to say their california rolls are pretty goodthe cost of the sushi itself is a bit pricey for the quality and sometimes quantity that you get i mean i got 2 mini hand rolls for 4 dollars when i could have gotten 2 large hand rolls for 6 dollars at the marketplace  bottom line a good place to go when you are attacked by that sushi cravingfood was ok for my i dont like sea food much my gf loved the calamari pasta location was nice it def gets crowded and we waited for an hour before we were able to eat   the reason 3 stars is i asked for light wine in my pasta and they did not do that also it is a very cramped inside stools so close to one another if you want more space fire 4 people eat outside but bring a jacket if there for dinner it gets windy and a bit coldweak steamed clams the waiter was great and the view was wonderful so go for that the bisque was way to much on the tomato side than he lobsterreally 35 stars pub and kitchen is tasty and has a great beer selection but the food menu is limited there are about 56 items of very pricey entrees and 56 more reasonably priced sandwiches they used to have fish and chips on the menu but unfortunately this item has been removed the burger was awesome and cooked perfectly although it seemed there was about 14 piece of bacon on it the pulled pork was also really delish and unique and the coleslaw accompanying it was great but i wish this came with fries too the service was good but our server checked on us frequently bordering on uncomfortably too much i would definitely go back for a beer and a burger and the company the best parts of the nightmiddle of the road beer just ok at best service was a notch lower than that cool building but lacks adequate parking given that the building exudes an almost religious brewery vibe they just did not get all the way to good in my opinion both times we have been there our server was trying way too hard to be cool and did not try hard enough to provide good service overall i surely expected more from a brewery located in a building like this too many other breweries in the area that are head and shoulders better than indiana city brewingwe went to the opening day which was a little chaotic but they had lovely free pastries and coffee so we gave high point a second run today a little bit disappointed tbh its fine but overall somewhat expensive and not terribly inspiring  service coffee and crepes just ok  they havent tried to do anything fresh with the mugshots space which would have given it a more distinctive identity were huge fans of the vineyard cafe which has fantastic crepes and some of the best service in the neighborhood so im not sure wed go out of our way to give high point a third go they might have to up their game in a neighborhood with this many great optionsit was okay  i purchased enchiladas and my son purchased a quesadilla  he had to go inside because the quesadilla wasnt put in the bag  the horchata was just mediocre  its nice to have authentic mexican through a drive thru  the prices and serving sizes were adequate but i think there are better options in the areai came in here for the first time i usually go to chickafil but wanted to try something different i got the grilled chicken salad it was good nothing special and wasnt any better that other places i get a chicken salad from inside it was decorated nice thoughgood service and food is good  however the food is the american version of what mexican food should be plus the prices are a little in the expensive side that said the place is in great location and the perfect place to spent an early friday or saturday night with a date or friends reason for the rating is the prices325  pretty good overall food  service  menu  smores sundae  325 pretty good frozen custard although wisconsin is still my gold standardthis is the first time l have ever been to a cracker barrel i went with my sister and her kids the table i was seated at had ketchup on it i didnt realize it until i put my arm down on the table this was way before we got food or drinks the floor behind me was filthy as well ketchup and left over food on the floor between our table and the table behind me i never would have paid attention if it wasnt for my niece dropping her toy constantly on the floor thats enough to be hesitant to stay then we get the food the fried chicken and macaroni  cheese were the best part of the meal my mash potatoes were barely like warm in the middle  almost cold plus the mash potatoes and fried apples were bland the gravy they used on the mash potatoes was really good also right after i left the restaurant my sister pointed out a bunch of food stains on my back needless to say i was shocked i just bought this shirt the precious day in ny at the nintendo store now its ruined i washed it once and it still hasnt came out yet i am not happy since i do live out of state on the west coast its not like i can go back easily and grab another  my only positive on this restaurant was the staff the staff was very polite and offered us great service with 2 rambunctious 3 year olds from the wait staff to the store staff everyone was polite  despite my positive on the staff i dont want to go back their anymore even to the one and only restaurant thats open in my city this place did not live up to its hype maybe it should focus more on the restaurant side rather then the store the store despite the crowd was impeccable nothing out of place and a person to put it back as soon as it was moved if the restaurant had that same attention to detail it would improve it a great dealdelicious organic burger but a bit overpriced for the size sweet potato fries excellent but also overpriced  service is goodgreat margaritas good service clean establishment space enough between tables indoor and outdoor seating good locale  food i wasnt impressed with my taco choices  i got the korean bbq and the special country fried chicken and gravy neither jumped out at me and made me happy  very little substance in the taco tiny quantity and no real pizzazz as far as cilantro shredded cabbage whatever  very dull in fact   salsa was mediocre as well  so  food 3 everything else 45  i would go back for a pitcher of margaritas but id probably bring my own salsathis place is not a bad stop for mexican food  very clean easy to read detailed menu and kind staff  we had a large party and some of the food was not hot at delivery  although the place was not crowded at all the waiters could have checked in with us more often  with a smaller group maybe a 4 person family i think it would be a lot betterplace is ok  food average  maybe i just ordered the least favorite items  nachos are average maple bacon slab was ok fried shrimp with mango was ok as well  sorry i can rave about this place although i pass it every day  this was my second visit  my first was much better  on the week they opened after a big lunch we decided to swing by district donuts and give the donuts here a try being in the middle of the afternoon there wasnt a long line and getting seating inside wasnt too hard either the vibe is pretty relaxed with a spacious feel some industrial finishes and spacious booths bar seating and some outdoor spots as well if you want to sit down most of the attention was focused on the donuts but as the name suggests they also serve sandwiches and coffee here  so a little bit of everything for everyone we ended up sticking with donuts trying out the chocolate glaze spicy maple praline and cookies and cream  howd it shake out to be honest i was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that i had seen on here and other places on the internet the donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side and outside of the maple praline i didnt think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts i have had i do have a soft spot in my heart and belly for maple donuts which explains why i liked that the best flavorwise  but it also didnt have any hint of spiciness at all which makes me wonder why the description even bothered the chocolate glazed donut was very average to me and the cookies and cream was also pretty genericthere was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top  overall the donuts are different from what youd pick up at a krispy kreme or dunkin donuts but it didnt measure up to the uniqueness and tastiness of other donutcentric shops that i have been to i would like to come back and try the sandwiches which looked tasty but from a donut standpoint i came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectationsi really really want to like this place more i love the fact that there is a local coffee place within walking distance of my work so that i can help the local economy while obtaining my caffeine fix   the only problem is that to me northwest just isnt that good i like the environment and ive always been able to find a seat if need be its also fun to see so many local clayton people going about their days both in and out of the shop but the employees are always very hit or miss all of the ladies are very nice but some of the guys are very blunt and unpersonable maybe not morning people who knows   i have never been impressed with their food case selection the options never rotate hope you either like cranberry walnut or chocolate and some of their offers are just marked up things from companion up the street granted i have never had their fresh made options which ive heard are good   they have some sort of digital punch card but i had to ask about it to sign up after having gone in the stop about 34 times a week for a month i feel like they should have a sign about it at the register unless they just hope people dont know about it so they dont have to give you freebies its also hit or miss on if your cashier will ask you for your punch card number so remember to bring it up if you want your points   the coffee itself is good both hot and iced as a coffee glutton i wish they would offer one more size up but that cant really be helped i wish they also made better dirty chai lattes because the one i had there was abysmal and undrinkable  i want to love you northwest i guess i just wish you cared about variety and your customers a little more despite this ill probably keep going here just because my options are slim hopefully ill grow to like you better in timefood was good but its overpriced staff wasnt friendly or rude restaurant wasnt clean they need to wipe down the tables and clean the floorseliscoreometer 313  being in santa barbara always makes me crave seafood either than or chorizo soaked in cheese given that seafood is abundant in the wharf areas and that my company and i had worked up an appetite running around the beach i opted to bring is here   first the company i was with could brighten any day so mood did not really affect this perspective second wine was poured so that also improved the spirits however there were some nottobe overlooked flaws and shortcomings to this place   the menu is a bit confusing should i look at the menu or the chalkboard ahead of me or the random appetizers haphazardly scattered around the place on small chalkboards this made it very hard for us to make orders that were of sound judgement but we persevered   oysters blue  local flavorful fresh very poorly shucked not a single one i had was cleaned properly of grit additionally many large chunks of shell were common in each one really not pleasant but they were so rushed who cares  rock crab their specialty was tasty though probably less than 3lbs quoted yet it was hard to compare against the size of the enormous spider crabs being hacked to bits through the window theres very little that can be incorrect about the preparation of this item served with butter an cocktail sauce and a number of wipes   abalone served fried over tomato rice pilaf of a sort it was reminiscent of a risotto but thats neither here nor there the abalone was tender enough lightly breaded and tasty it was probably the best item but something we ordered after we noticed it in some tiny corner of the blackboard it was difficult to get the waiter back to make the order   overall the meal was fine however the constant negative chatter from the unseated guests piling up behind us and shoved into the entranceway was unappealing they were hungry and irritated by the lack of service commenting about what we were eating and how long it was taking but the restaurant did nothing to deal with the massive crowd ill stick to brophys or any one of the hundred other seafood establishments that offer a much better experienceits really a good lunch spot on weekdays low price and limited choices taste is so so though i ordered thai hot pot thinking its spicy but i really cant tell afterwards what does that hot mean its neither spicy nor hot as in more than warm also im never sure whether should i leave tips at a place like this you know seems like a fast food joint but still with some seviceif you find yourself in terminal d definitely check this place out they have pretty decent sandwiches for you to enjoy there or on your flight probably one of the better sandwiches ive had at an airport for sure i have to agree that its extremely slow so i would not recommend stopping if you gotta move quickly it took us about 20 minutes to receive our food we ordered the roast beef and smoked turkey sandwich both really good im not sure what the long wait was about but if you have the time to kill which most people do in an airport check this place outive been drinking la colombe for years and i have been twice disappointed with the nizza espresso here the first time i visited this location i ordered a cortadogibraltar excited since i hadnt had la colombe in a year and a half and i was feeling nostalgic i already knew something looked wrong from the darker color of the coffee swirled in the milk it was burnt yes i know the color of the crema doesnt matter but it does matter if it normally is lighter and the same coffee i drank it but i didnt enjoy it i probably shouldve said something but alas i didnt and checked it off as a bad oneoff   a few weeks later a month maybe i return to the same location and decide to order an espresso the nizza once again giving it another chance to redeem itself the barista started talking to me asking me questions trying to have a conversation while he was pulling the shot maybe thats what killed it i took my coffee and sat down with the rest of my party already having noticed that the crema was very dark not a definite sign of burnt but i could smell it one other person in my group also had his coffee their regular drip burnt as well even less drinkable than mine to the point where he a person who basically never takes anything back took it back which they did when they smelled it and realized it was really burnt i had already chugged half of mine so i decided to stomach it again   maybe theyre fazing out their nizza and i should try their new single origin next time i will stick to the craft coffee my friends la colombe atmosphere is so nice their pastries delicious but i dont dare try their nizza ever again at this location will update my review next time im in townwe ordered take out it was good the meat was good but just good it was pretty oily though the fries were good crispy which i liked the shakes were very yummy i do recommend those vanilla and chocolatei am not sure how this place get such good reviews since it is all prepackaged tourist food the grouperwhich you should get blackened was pretty decent i got that as the substitute for haddock it cost five dollars for the upgrade but was worth it the scallops were good as was the grilled shrimp but the green beans were terrible the crabcakes were awful too its an ok location but you have to pay for parking like every other place in clearwater it tasted no different than joes crap shack the best part about this place was the service i have to say that stacy was very attentive very professional and made it a more enjoyable experiencethe service was great  i think the guy was the owner possibly but the crepes were not proportioned right  the one i had had too many blackberries and too much mascarpone cheese  the one my brother got had so much nutella and cherries it looked kinda like a nutella soup hopefully they step up their game i really want them to do goodpancake pantry smentry this place is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overrated this was one of the first breakfast joints that ive tried when i first moved to nashville people couldnt stop raving about this place so i dragged my friends out of their bed on a sat morning to wait 40 mins before we got our table   the service was descent and so were their breakfast its not anything to die for i guess i didnt get the memo but whats so special i would have given this place two stars due to their long line and them not opening for lunch or dinner only breakfast but they get a bump up because their potato pancake was pretty good but thats about it   maybe i was irritated and anticipating some food to die for but this was ok sure its better than the chain pancake places but not specialty store where i would wait longer than 15 minsthis review is just a warning  if you order online the catalog description will give the year or vintage of the wine along with the points  however   there are these little boxes that are automatically checked for you unless you uncheck them in which you agree they can switch the vintage      even if you search their site indicating you only want to see wines that are in stock in a particular store they do inventory only on the wine regardless of the year   you go to pick up you order and lo and behold many of the wines are unavailable  and i mean more than half     so for example if you choose a pinot noir  2011 rated high by users and with 90 wine points rating  they can substitute 2012 even though that year  may be horrible  my advice save yourself the trouble and dont use their website   go to the store that said the store is huge  and does have good prices   especially on their 5 cent salegreat coffee drinks great pastry asiago cheeseanything always wins my favor  reasonable prices and very popular with the sitdownlaptopornewspaper table squatters and the walkin crowd that judging by the efficiency of the line  knows how to navigate this popular spotwas said to be the best in philly did not hold up to that name the fries were good but would not say the best i had i had the blackened chicken breast with shrimp they went way overboard with the spice  the chicken was juicy on the inside though i ended up eating only a little of it wifey enjoyed the broil seafood platter and i enjoyed her fish and shrimp more than she did  the pineapple cake desert was on the money you can not go wrong with that our waitress was kind and attentive and though we used a groupon for dinner she removed my chicken dinner from the bill because i did not eat it that was very nice of her so though not the best food in philly it is a nice place to eat and the decor was how  a seafood restaurant should be  i can not say we will visit it again but i am sure they will do welllet me start out by saying that i loved my breakfast  i had the crawfish omelet and it was wonderful crawfish were fresh and hot  rest of the  meal was just average  it was crowded and load but i guess that is a sign of good food  my problem was that you had to move the mop bucket out of the way to get to the cooler with the juices and milk  ick staff was very friendlygood aka only choice for frozen yogurt in manayunk the yogurt flavors are extensive and the topping bar has an overwhelming amount of fruits and candies to chose from i also like the option of turning your creation into a smoothie   what i dislike about whirled peace is the layout when it comes to froyo people can be indecisive and want to tastetest or play around with the flavor combos this makes it difficult for someone me who is very decisive about her yogurt selection have to wait around during the hemming and hawing or cut around you to the toppings either way the layout is a little annoying also i find it a bit expensive but it does hit the spot when you have a froyo cravinganother mediocre tampa mexican joint the state of mexican food in tampa bay is just so so sad if you eat here the best thing was the carnitas tacos  dear xtreme if you are reading this review please get real ac your ac sucks and its always 1000 degrees in there  parking is also a problemo herethe review is for the restaurant not the food the food is amazing and the quality is great the restaurant is ok as far as cleanliness but its cold omg its soooo cold in here im shaking its always like this and if you are cold natured get take out i am going to bring a thermometer next time but guessing 58ish in here the soap dispenser in the restroom doesnt work unless you work for it hope the employees have another place to wash hands second time ive been here that the soap has been sketchy had the chicken with verde sauce it was terrific again eat here bring a parka would be four stars if it were comfortable in here but trying to eat with teeth chattering sucksfor all the hype i heard about pp i just dont think it lived up to my expectations we waited about 30 minutes on a monday which it seems like is on the shorter end and i thought it was ok maybe i my expectations were too high or i ordered wrong i actually got lunch the turkey wrap which i understand isnt their specailty but i also got a pancake on the side nice you can do that which was good and i also liked the warm syrup bottles on every table they do have quite an extensive pancake menu  it is a cozy restaurant and definitely a good place for breakfast i was just expecting out of this world as with most of the people in nashville the server was very friendly and even split our checks without asking if you are in town for a short trip and the wait is 2 hours i dont think its necessarily worth the wait but is a good spot if you have timei had a cl deal to burn and ordered the bistec ala mexican strip steak last thursday night  the steak was nicely cooked and well seasoned as were the sauted onions and peppers the black beans were good but nothing overly impressive  the bartender i ordered with was helpful and friendly  my issue was with the size of the entree  as one of the priciest options on the menu the portion should be enough for a meal  this was reminiscent of the scaled down sizes served to earlybirds or as lunch  it wouldnt have even filled a single tortilla  the only sufficient portion was the big pile of rice go figure luckily i had a cl deal otherwise i wouldnt been more upsetjess was fun and attentive as bartenders go she definitely had her regulars small town bar but she and they made me feel like one of the crew food was okay sauce was good but my bacon was burned and part of the pork was dry overall it was an enjoyable time good place to catch a ballgamei absolutely love this place food is very good beer is cold and a great variety facility is clean service is extremely inconsistent  i have been to this location several times and each time it is like going to a different restaurant  for the first time we had a great server rachel  although the service was slow she was great   again out order was wrong  but she actually caught it before we could say anything   she apologized and coolrrected it immediately  not sure if the problem is corporate or local management but someone needs to address the inconsistency in everything from service to portion size to timing  overall if you have time it is worth the wait but dont go starving or you may not make it before you are initially served  12 minutes from sitting to getting my beerhardees is the red headed step child when it comes to fast food it always seems to take a back seat to mcdonalds wendys and jack in the box however i always forget that their food is actually better than all of the other options  i stopped by this location while in a hurry and needed a quick meal i opted for the chicken tender sandwich which was three chicken tenders with honey mustard bacon and cheese on a standard bun the chicken tenders were good not dried out like some places  this location was clean with a friendly staffwhat is great about this starbucks is its location as gerald s noted   given the dearth of decent to go coffee purveyors in this area starbucks is a nice addition to this neighborhood   as other yelpers have noted this is a relatively small store  it has comfy chairs and is a nice place to meet a friend for coffee and convo the staff is pleasant and helpful even if they are not always burdened with a sense of urgencyoh the pancake  many a hungover breakfast was spent there in my single days  this place is fun if you want to meet up with your friends in the village and stand in line a long time  out the door or wake up at 200 pm and roll in shortly before close  i love southern breakfast food  while this is standard fare the reason why pancake got so popular for people wondering what the big deal is has to do with nashville being music city usa and musicians eating there not so much for the food  that is the secret  i personally am not a country music fan nor have i ever been the star struck type  who knows or cares whether the rich and famous even deign to descend on the pancake anymore  but as a native nashvillian reading the bad reviews here i feel it my duty to give you the dl on why pancake became the hot spot that it isnot exactly greek  this is a decent place which for some reason is usually swimming in college educated mid 20s  early 30s estrogen women love kanella take a date here  ill admit im biased im greek and ive been all over greece ive never been to cyprus therefore i dont really like the food if it is supposed to be what i know from greece i even prefer turkish food to what ive had at kanella   the food at kanella isnt bad for what it is i cant say whether it is authentic cypriot cuisine its nothing like mainland greek cuisine i can say for sure at least from a northern greek perspective there are better options in the city in this price range try estia  that all said the service was friendly best part of the whole meal was the desserts and coffee if the place werent so small and perhaps had lots of sidewalk seating in summertime i would be there several nights per week just for desert and coffee but this is philadelphiapopovers and blondies both very well done though not much else to add other than if youre in the mood for a delicious blondie in a romantic setting come to blondies they do have one of the nicest sitting areas in downtown st louis with a nice fireplace plush seating and pastel colors as well as an outdoor area to enjoy the outdoor happenings of washington ave their hours have changed so check in if theyll have a live band or be open late in the eveningthis place seems destined to fail which is too bad  maybe with the new museum right across the street it will be saved  the food is ok the prices a bit high for the offering but the setting is pretty awesome  quiet and relaxing without pushing you out the door    i dont know much about the area but imagine this would be a great place to have a wedding or event and a nice place to grab a cup of coffee on a weekend morning   good luck to themvery pleasant dining particularly on the outdoor deck overlooking the schuylkill and its busy adjacent sidewalks did not try the pizzas but they looked and smelled good as they went by a broccolini salad was a generous portion with long shavings of parmigiano and prosciutto some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice the famous meatballs weredifferent with a vealtomato sauce and pine nuts very good but some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice at 11 though for three averagesize meatballs i thought that was a bit high a sea scallop appetizer was quite good also but at 15 for just two scallops that was a bit high some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice a small dollop of spaghetti with rock shrimp and a two cooked slices of cappacolle gobagool in a spicy tomato and squid ink sauce looked disgusting on the plate but was delicious at 14 for such a small portion i thought it was as they say in the trade a bit high and some bread accompanying it wouldve been nice to mop up the sauce  if someone else is paying youll love in riva  all employees were efficient and most kind indeed hopefully one of them will think hey we  know how to make great pizza crust why dont we roll some into loaf shapes and make bread to slice for the patrons delicious appetizers and entrees theyll say were nicethis is a really attractive place with a friendly staff last time we were there we shared the place with a brewery tour bus so it was a festive atmosphere i really did not like any of the beers i tasted though perhaps its just methese donuts were pretty good a bit more cakey than other donuts weve had but the unique flavors had us really interested we ordered the the apple jelly filled the cranapple filled and two classic chocolate donuts they were good to try i will say there wasnt a ton of filling in the jellyfilled donuts we were surprised at how little they tasted as though they were a couple days old the customer service was top notch though   the location was great when we arrived shortly after 930am on a friday but id imagine it could get very cramped very quickly i was surprised there wasnt really any place to eat the donuts in the shop but we found a park nearbyanother burger joint in town  burger and fries eaten were ok  i will return to try the signature milk shakesthis place came to town with a huge reputation out west and a huge ego and i think the people of indianapolis should slap the shit out of them for their cockiness and tell them to make a better freaking burger   when you walk in the walls are adorned with a thousand magazine articles heralding the place you would think it was la bernadine or something la bernadine is a 4 star restaurant in new york owned and operated by eric ripert eric ripert is one of the best chefs in the world anyway the place thinks is the shit but in stead of being the shit its just shit i had the cajun fries with my underwhelming burger and they were gross too   the burger was so unappealing it had minimal flavor and im guessing they arent using the best beef in the world the topping options are sparse and the dining options are more sparse still would you like a burgeror aburger   i was looking forward to the experience because of the swagger but left with more of a staggernot really as bad as people say i come here a lot because it somewhat satisfies my constant cravings for japanese food without having to commute all the way to state street or goleta  while the place does seem a little sketchy the rolls are pretty solid the hungry roll is huge and not to mention deep fried its good unique and filling and comes with miso soup so yummy and salad the kiss dragon roll was pretty good as well  i tried the sashimi dinner plate today and it was a little sketch only the salmon and tuna tasted legit while the other fish didnt taste as fresh i dont think this is the best place to come for raw fish or ramen for that matter the ramen is basically ramen noodles placed in a generic udon broth   order the chicken katsu plate or sesame chicken but keep in mind that the portions arent exactly worth the price you pay in terms of the entrees and sashimi   however if you are looking for a decent japanese place come here for the specialty rolls their lunch happy hour is a pretty good deal too so check that out the only thing is that some of the dishes are way too expensive for the quantity they give other than that id come back for the rollsthe beer selection here is ok the problem is you cant taste any of it before you buy it if im going to pay almost 15 for a growler i want to make sure i like what im getting the staff seemed polite and knowledgeable but descriptions of beers only go so far if i want to pick up a growler on this side of town ill be going down the street a bit where they have just as good of selection and you can sample it firstthis place is generally hit or miss when its on its game its awesome but when its a miss its all kinds of frustrating  a big part of the quality is how many people are staffed and who is cooking the burgers when theres more than one person behind the counter the service is generally prompt and at least courteous and when the cook makes your burger the way you want it the food is spot on their fries are always amazing especially the truffle fries  things get problematic when theres only one person there to do register and cook or when your burger comes out overdone ive gone in several times to find no one behind the counter and had to wait for several minutes before someone emerged from the back to take my order and make my food once the guy who came out was on his phone and continued his conversation while ringing me out and then cooking my burger   additionally the burgers are overdone one out of every three times they have very specific descriptions of what youll get when you order your burger a specific way but they dont seem to adhere to that particularly well i always order rare and im not always happy with what i get from the grill  overall i like this place and ill keep going back but they need to step up their gamethe food was great but we went to this place because it had a starbucks inside or so we thoughtturns out they serve starbucks coffee but not all starbucks drinkslike an iced venti vanilla latte the parking was crazy had to park in front of the dumpsters and because of how many people were trying to find a space or get out of there we had to exit through the drive thrusorry but this cuisine is average at best seems like the frozen dinners i get not good   the one thing that saved this restaurant from a twostar review is their genuine and happy customer service   go in with your expectations at the right level  ive been to hendricks a few times now and i would love to give it 5 stars but i dont think it deserves it i want to love it the meat i would give 5 stars the sauce i would give 45 stars but i think the sides are just lacking there seems to be a problem with even knife cuts and inconsistent seasoning as well  this time my mom had a giant uneven slice of tomato on her burger and the kitchen forgot to put the cheese on it i love the corn casserole but it can sometimes be dry and this time it was lacking salt the other sides ive experienced are the collard greens which were good but i just dont think i like collard greens the baked beans were 5 star worthy the sweet potato fries were cold and needed a lot more salt they also were unevenly cut so some were more like chips and others were like fries the creamed spinach was a little rich for me i prefer my spinach a little less mushy and weighed down by heavy sauce ive also tried the deviled eggs which were good theyre super tangy and heavy on the mustard though so if you dont like mustard you wont like them overall i like this place the atmosphere and decoration is great the smell is divine i love the meats and the sauces i just think they could do a little better on the sides how hard is it to salt the food and cut it nicelythe food is always hot and enjoyable to eat delivery is on point only things you have to order 15 dollars for them to order the food to you but most likely you will enjoy the food my favorite is general tso and plain fried ricei liked fired up bbq just ok dont get me wrong im a carnivore i love me my meat but i just cant seem to get into southern barbeque i think its the kind of bbq sauce i havent given up yet though  i think my experience with this place might also be skewed due to arriving about half an hour before closing so there was less variety for the meats and sides none of the sides we tried were outstanding mac and cheese spanish rice southwestern corn potato salad for meats we had ribs and brisket huge portions so decent bang for your buck the ribs were tender and falling of the bone unfortunately i like my ribs to have a little bit of chew with a smoky sauce which was ok but not for me the brisket was excellent with a good balance of fat and meat cooked so that it shredded easily under my fork they dont have fried chicken which kind of surprised me  isnt that a hallmark of southern food i could be wrong  the place is kind of in a strange location and its got more of a fast food feel to it rather than sitdown restaurant by virtue of ordering at the front getting a plastic tray and having the meats and sides readymade behind the counter overall if youre in the area or love barbeque its probably worth checking out but for me once was enoughi saw that the hours had been expanded so decided to stop in one afternoon theyve done a really great job remodeling the space theres tons of seating and the decor is really cute however for the quality of the food the price was really steep   the cheese fundido w chorizo was probably the best thing we ordered it was gooey and had lots of veggies but it was not worth 10   i also have a hard time paying 45 dollars for a single taco unless they are just great and these were not although the tacos were hefty and filled well the lack of salt and lack of salsa selection left me unsatisfied just not worth 5 my boyfriend was also very underwhelmed with his selection of tacos although he mentioned he liked the idaho taco the best   they did have a good local beer selection you could tell the tortillas were fresh and the workers at the counter were really nice  bottom line if youre going to gentrify tacos they need to have a lot more flavor this place has lots of potential but the college crowd who lives in the area will not be interested in paying 15 for a set of bland tacosdecent little spot to grab a quick bite a bit overpriced but their cookies are amazing the juices arent that great ive tried several and they are all a bit off no need to try and be overly inventive with flavors kiss  keep it simple stupid all in a good place if you have no time for lunch and dont want fast foodwent here on a monday with couple of friends for some drinks and small meals all the while also looking for a new monday spot i ordered two appetizers and a glass of pomegranate juice my total came to 25 whoa thats a little pricey for small plates wings good crab cakes good cornbread fritters good shrimp tacos meh the texture was good however a whole shrimp is placed in middle of a taco shell itll be so much better if they were at least chopped up so it spreads in the shell more the coleslaw was bland not much flavor to it overall the shrimp tacos just didnt cut it for us i will not be ordering it in the future our server was good but there were couple of times when he was nowhere to be found when we needed something needless to say this wont be a regular monday spot my husband and i stopped to try big q over the weekend the fried chicken and biscuits are really good the pulled pork was also very good the sides left us wanting more though they ran out if collard greens on a saturday at 5pm which was unfortunate the mac and cheese was eh and the fries were run of the mill the portions are small for the price also ill give it some time and try this place again in a few monthsthe space is huge and inviting with reasonably comfy tables and chairs a nice upgrade from the truckee shop lots of nice decorative details too like the mosaic lion on the wall it looks like theyre still landscaping out back which should be a nice outdoor space in the spring i shared a latte with the wife and thought it was great and fresh kids hot chocolate for the kid was tasty enough   the big ding was for a 675 calzone made next doori believe that they reheated on the panini press while the filling was tasty enough the reheating seared and slightly warmed a  chewy stale crust this awful texture voided anything good going inside the thing while the preassembled sandwiches seem to hold up to the refrigeration and reheating i would highly recommend coffeebar nix the reheated calzone idea it just doesnt workcame here on a slow wednesday night but the place filled up fast  i ordered sushi rolls and we had udon soup and salad  i would say the sushi was slightly above averagenothing spectacular  the udon was small for the price but was pretty good  i dont understand the wild raves about this place but maybe i ordered the wrong thing  its an average sushi spot as far as i can tellim not sure why this restaurant is rated so highly  the food was average i ordered a gyro and it had once slice of a tomato and barely any tzatziki sauce  everyone in my group had the same experience with their gyros  others in the group had average meals  the best part of the meal was the salad  spend your money as you see fit but ive found better food elsewhereive been here and the burgers are okay not bad but for the same price you could go to zinburger or cheesecake factory and get a better burger that isnt so greasy the burgers are decent here though and the do have free peanutsthis restaurant was simply ok it got such rave reviews so perhaps my expectations were too high nonetheless everything about it was ok let me tell ya why  the ambiance was nice the decor was modern and unpretentious tables were spread far enough apart that you could enjoy a conversation without hearing your neighbor blab about her boyfriends snoring or her irritating mother in law they are also able to accommodate large groups comfortably   food was pretty goodthe problem the portions were tiny they were like designer little meals with the matching price in a setting that would be more fit for upscale burgers and such my 1 had the duck and she was not feeling it i had the brisket which was delish tiny but it tasted wonderful for dessert we had peach cobbler which was pretty good and the lemon pie thingy our waiter raved about it so again i think i was expecting too much it tasted like key lime pie pretty good but nothing over the top  service was spot on our waiter was friendly and for the most part attentive i really liked that he paid special attention to food allergies its always a plus to walk out of the restaurant alive   all in all the was a decent experience i would likely not return just because there are so many other wonderful places to try in the area if you decide to check it out get the brisket you wont be sorryi tried a small sample of the spumante secco at the tasting bar and liked it enough to buy a bottle for our group  but the bottle was flat    the 10 music night included light appetizers which turned out to mean pretzels and crackers  i was expecting something a bit more substantial  they did have pizza for sale  but it was nothing specialoverall a quality brewery  service is quick and friendly  food items are good but not outstanding and portions are large  beers are cheap and good  and thats what youre here for anyway rightum its decent for 5 people got the rock crab special and spider crab which came with 5 clam chowders   we love shellfish but this was not our favorite just nothing special about it simply put the place is overrated  oh and they charge an automatic gratuity for live crab i know they charge a automatic gratuity for parties of 6 but nothing about the live crab so heads up anyone who is going there for the first timeexpensive but fairly clean and convenient i just started working next to them so itll be my goto for lunchessnacks when i forget to pack one or get too lazy to i def wouldnt do all my grocery shopping here though its okreading the reviews makes me wonder if i went to the same place as the other reviewers   i had reserved a table for one for 730p this eve upon arrival i was seated at the worst table in the house the one by the entrance in which the two seat options were either immediately behind the entry door which would hit me each time it swung open or on the opposite side of the table where the vent was blowing ferociously on me i chose the latter as long as the waitress offered me the next open table a deal was made and thankfully carried out right after the bread was served   one waitress seemed to be catering to every table so it did take me a few minutes to receive my turn a rundown of the menu and the obligatory introductory bread i opted for four pasta dishes explaining to her to leave out the seafood in any of them due to my allergy   each came out quickly in succession as per request but the main carbonara dish came with the swordfish rather than without so i left much of it untouched the rigatoni and gnocchi plates were solid the pesto pasta was rich on basil which was not to my liking but not the fault of the restaurant  my waitress noticed the carbonara mishap and offered to bring me a new one but i was ready for dessert i ordered the almond panna cotta which was this evenings highlight easily light yet filling and with fruit to complement the airiness  i was offered a complimentary zeppoli dish of doughnuts over nutella and did finish those which also did please the palate  my three stars are for the table situation the quick and almost abrupt nature of the waitress in serving me no niceties or time to minglelinger and the cold cold dining room seriously bring a parka the food was overall presented well through i will likely never head to nj from philly for dinner again as its a far visit for a culinary scene that cannot compare to phillysnice but expensive i live in the chicago area so i know that goceris can be costly but this place was more than i normally pay i had to stop in while visiting family to get some salad fixings since i that was my potluck dish to bring  everything cost more than at home  lettuce tomatoes vinegar and herbs  the store is big and has lots of food to go options with sushi and a salad bar but the layout seems a bit awkward as i kept having grocery cart traffic jams i need many areas  its nice but not worth the pricethis is a nice place to sit down and have a cup of coffee a nice breakfast or one of their many pastries  the decor is even nice enough to meet here for a lunch date  the coffee is good  i found the latte to be soso  the cookies they have are great  i cannot pass up the opportunity to have a chocolate chip or oatmeal cookie  the oatmeal cookie is huge  the chocolate chip cookie is unique with large chunks of chocolate chips  one day i will stop through and try one of their breakfast entreesbecause of a groupon i finally got to try this place i would like to give it 35 stars but the rating system wont let me i loved that they offered the jubilee nut brown ale i also loved their unique taco creations i went with 3 tacos recommended by the hostess the tequila lime chicken fish and southern fried the tequila lime was my favorite a great combination of flavors the southern fried my second favorite the fish was average the disappointment came from the tortillas on all of them they were not even warmed up they tasted so store boughtpackaged that it took away from the great flavors and tastes offered in the tacos they say they are locally made so if they are they are the worse locally made tortillaswe came as a huge family ordered lots of food 3orders of scallion pancake pretty good 3 orders of fried noodles some of the noodles are not fully cooked 1 order of fish congee  really good 1 order sauted spinach salty  2 order of fried rice alright 1 order of green bean with pork ok 2 order of spicy wonton they only gave us one decide to not go get it cuz is too far the rest is alright they were at busy hour so the server is kind of mean and we ordered some drinksthey were sweet and really powdery  and yea three star because most of the food are good but they forgot one order i think its garbage that they started making me wait in line for them to pump my coffee out of the thermos  and still makes me walk to the back of the store to pour my own milk let us do it all ourselves like weve been doing for as long as i can remember or really make my coffee i do not like this system  it makes me late now and i wont be stopping in the morning any longer other than that  if you dont have a job or arent in any sort of hurry go to buddy brew because the coffee is goodwent there on thursday late in the  afternoon i was really looking forward to their sea urchin and rock crab unfortunately they were sold out their next batch was not to come in from their fisherman until the evening at we know its fresh settled for their scallop ceviche  it was a bit underwhelming flavor was a bit lacking their clam chowder was really good crab cakes were a bit subpar not enough crab chunks kinda doughy i may return again the next time im up that way will try to get there a bit earlier in the afternoon for availability of rock crab and sea urchin i am really hoping the place can redeem itself the next time aroundsolid the best part about going to whaleys is the fact you just stopped at a roadside bbq smoke shack to get food hell yeah i have always wanted to try the ribs but i havent had the chance yet i feel its very possible another star is in their future once i do as for the pork sandwiches 5 for 10 bucks or 2 for 5 come on smoked on site soft buns and great homemade sauce what more do you want out of your roadside bbq stand if you find yourself hungry while riding out on 41 someday swing in and try it outim always in the mood for sweets first time there though i was a little put off by the ordering systempicking from choices on a pad you pick the donut topping etc not sure why you cant just place the order verballysaves time they say after all that the actual donut was ok3 stars because the bar staff was great walked in and no one was at the hostess station to seat me so i went to the bar area a friend recommended that i try the bread pudding but ive had better the shrimp and grits was amazing i was under the weather and the bartender made me a hot toddy and was very attentive which made up for the lack of service upon my initial arrival cant say i was impressed enough to returnim definitely not the target demo for this place because im not really the kind of guy who likes to spend ten bucks on a sandwichdrink combo if im going to pay that much for a sandwich id rather go to a dedicated sandwich shop jersey mikes is usually my goto rather than pay the premium that comes with a cafe like this  its hard to totally call the meal overpriced though since i actually really liked the food i had the newks q sandwich bbq chicken and it was great i subbed the chips for a pasta salad in an illfated attempt for a healthier option and that was a regrettable choice but overall great food  theres tons of seating and its a very open space so the atmosphere is nice but in the end i just dont think its the place for me id much rather get a better and bigger sandwich at jersey mikes for a couple dollars lessordered for pickup when i arrived order was ready when i got home opened bag found wrong order had to go back and exchange order but also was charged for wrong order and was refunded difference food is always good here this is the first time had issue with themi took my kids and the line was pretty long the cinnamon roll was a bit hard and the toppings were not that great i feel like the price for what you get is not that great of a value i prefer cinnabon at the local mavricksa fuji apple chicken salad is made with more than lettuce tomato and dressing maybe if the girl behind the counter would stop making eyes at the guy behind the counter with her i would not have had to ask for them to fix it   3 stars is only for the fact that they made the salad again for me the right waynot a bad place just a short walk from the ballpark  they have a broad selection of beers and a small food menu  i liked the chocolate milk stout quite a bit  service was a little lacking compared to the other breweries that i visited  im pretty sure that i could have fit the bartenders personality and helpfulness into a thimbleculvers is just okay to me  if you like buttered steaknshake patties and white castle fries then try culversim waiting in line as we speak and by waiting i mean ive been in line for 20 minutes we shall see if they get the order correctfirst by letting me say i am a starbucks addict i eat drink or work at some starbucks location almost every single day this time i didnt go in but just grab myself some coffee in the drivethrough this starbucks drivethrough is not necessarily ideal you have to basically go through the line of fire from the drivethrough line to get to the front door if you decided you wanted to go inside instead of using the drivethrough this location is also connected to body pages which if you have some dry cleaning and want to grab a coffee is absolutely ideal however the layout for the drivethrough and parking for the guests that are going into the location is a bit dangerous and a bit muddled up you have people there parking across the street that are trying to get into the entrance you have people from the drivethrough trying to get out of the drivethrough and into the drive through and all of them have to cross in the same general area unfortunately this is the only drivethrough starbucks within quite some ways and if its snowing or raining and youre in a hurry this is going to be your best bet the people here are always absolutely amazing like all starbucks so i give them three stars for the drivethrough but five stars for the staffmy usual beer and pub food destination in wayne was too busy so we trekked on to ardmore as ive been wanting to try tired hands  heard about the high craftsmanship and unique styles there and had high expectations  arriving at the fermentaria we were greeted with a onehour waiting time  having come this far we decided to stick it out  we headed to the bar and perused the beer list  finding that it is way heavily weighted toward pale ales and all kinds of fruity concoctions we ordered a couple of the tired hands saison  not bad but definitely not what ive come to expect from a belgianstyle saison  very sour on the finish lacking subtlety  thinking that maybe i just dont have refined taste in their type of beers i tried two other varieties  frankly they all tasted remotely similar as if they have limited range in their hops and brew styling  we eventually got a seat at the bar tables noticing that several dining tables had remained vacant the entire time we were waiting  ordered crispy pork belly buns not bad but pricey for two small buns and wife and i had crab and fish tacos respectively  tacos were savory good blend of flavors and ample serving sizes  asked the server if they brewed anything along the lines of a brown ale belgian dubbel or trippel stout etc etc etc  she recommended yet another what turned out to be yeasty spicy citrusy beer  it seems many beer enthusiasts are crazy about this place and their brews ive seen the great ratings on their beers though i found that they are limited in their range maybe my beer palate is not as refined as i thought but i would take victorys brew pub any time over this for variety depth and less radical artisan haughtiness than this brewerybetter than your average sandwich shop ie panera they have a lot to choose from and the ingredients seem more localfresh we went there on a sunday afternoon and it was pretty crowded so be prepared to wait for a seat or to order takeout they have a range of foods from soupssalads to sandwiches very much like panera bread but im not too big of a fan of panera i give it a 35 since its good but not omg orgasmic good   best sandwich  chucks 99i got the philly cheese steak with fried pickles   fried pickles were pretty meh cheese steak was fine   they messed up the order for the guy in front of mesnow was light and fluffy and the creators behind the counter was more than generous with their syrups by dousing the ice with a second pouring of our chosen flavors  we chose nectar cream and passionfruit  now heres the thing  i like my flavors pronounced and bold as much as the next person but i was slightly disappointed with the somewhat artificial taste of the passionfruit syrup  comparing it to another place my husband and i tried on our first day here this places homemade grapefruitbasil syrup paired with their version of the nectar cream felt more light and refreshing however because theirs did not have a second dousing of flavor the syrup didnt get a chance to drizzle their way towards the bottom before we gobbled it up  in the end ultimately this place is clearly popular and youre not going to leave feeling unrefreshedgreat pitchers of margaritas food is alright i wish the chips and salsa were better i asked to pay the up charge for the spicy salsa and she brought me a bowl of green slimy looking sauce not too appetizing the burritos were decent thoughthis place was the only place with a lot of stars and over 600 yelpers were on board stating it was good  unfortunately this place was simply okay there is a sign in sheet by the door and the place is a small restaurant and maybe a five table seating outside inside seemed crowded  after standing there i noticed a side window and tables across the way felt that we were hungry and really didnt want to wait  went with the shrimp and scallop pasta dish with linguine and it wasnt outstanding it was okay also tried their clam chowder and the clams were non existing   my date tried their shrimp tacos 2 with some rice she said they were okay nothing great either  bill came out to 45 for just okay food i for one dont mind spending on good food but i truly felt this place was hype  oh wellnot bad food ordered the country fried chicken little disappointed that is came with brown gravy instead of country white was a little too much breading on the chicken as well my wife had the spinach chicken pizza which was good as well but had a little too much oregano on it service was excellent though we will return again and try some other items as it was a very nice evening therethis particular location of cvs is right on the corner of napoleon and south claiborne near ochsner baptist hospital  products what you might typically find at any of these big box pharmacy chainsotc medicines rx medicines beauty products supplements photography accessories snacks etc there are usually wellstocked and their prices not unreasonable 3 stars  service the management has definitely imparted the importance of the greeting when a customer enters the establishment theres at least one cashier working at any time but sometimes 2 during busier times a security guard is almost always present some pharmacy staff in the back and they have docinabox service available for those requiring quick nonemergency care 3 stars  facilities a typical brickandmortar flattop building youd expect from this chain there is ample private lot parking and a drive through for the pharmacy the major issue ive noted with the outside is the trashcan is not emptied often enough other than that the exterior is quite nice the inside is aisled with the medical services in the rear there is nothing really remarkable to say about the interior its usually tidy though 3 stars  overall this is a regular stop for me when i require a pharmacy there is a walgreens across the street thats typically filled with all sorts of riffraff i try to avoid if i can if youre in this area go here instead 3 starswanted to love this place as it is near our house the food was overpriced with a 3 price tag on a ham biscuit if it was amazing i would have no problem with the price but it was a premade biscuit just slightly larger then a silver dollar with very small scrawny piece of ham and microwaved at 5 i had a butternut squashbacon egg pie slice of quiche which was also on the small side but tasted good in all i am sure this would be a good alternate coffee stop but would not recommend if you are looking for food with that coffeei lived in chicago for 30 years all over the chicago metropolitan area reallysouth side north side downtown and even out in the suburbs hell  my first paying job was selling newspapers at the corner of randolph and michigan in the early 80s that said the dog i got at this place only shared two characteristics with the hundreds if not thousands that i ate when i lived in the 312 steamed bun and bright green pickle relish the similarities end there   dog itself was alright but lacked the garlicky flavor typical of a real chicago dog not sure what brand theyre using but it certainly isnt coming out of the plant that shall remain nameless but is located just down the street from the board of education if youve been there you wont mistake that product for what these guys are serving the bun was wrong too no poppy seeds and not quite as tall as it should be to hold the ingredients in   i will probably make it back as i work pretty close by these days but ill have to dig deeper into the menu to see if the beef or the pizza puff bring back the memories the way i was expecting   yes the woman at the counter was rude and short with me no that isnt chicago ambiancehw produce is worth checking out if you are looking for a place to buy inexpensive fruits and vegetables i stumbled upon this store by chance and now it is on my goto list of places whenever i am on the south side of edmonton there are always lots of seasonal fruits and vegetables in stock here you will find your regular and familiar produce as well as occasional exotic fruits and veggies some are locally grown while others are imported from bc and the us shelves are never empty and are always restocked with new produce because the turnover is so high the majority of fruits and vegetables are fresh and crispy although they seem to go bad a lot faster than fruits and vegetables bought at lets say save on which may be due to the fact that they are all natural and not coated with paraffin not all fruits and veggies are fresh though sometimes there are somewhat old stale looking products on the shelves the store gets extremely busy on the weekends so in order to have the best shopping experience some as early in the day as possible or better yet stop by during the weekcame in to an almost empty restaurant tucked in location off of bay to bay lit bit of outdoor seating inside seating felt chipotleesk not your typical sushi spot if you crave the typical asian atmosphere this is not your place our server was not asian open kitchen visible for patrons i had green tea edamame salad miso soup and a rose cave roll edamame salad was okay i prefer the hot edamame with salt the rose cave roll was okay as well nothing to rave about i probably will not be back but mostly because i like the typical asian decor service experienceted drewes is a st louis staple i didnt even know what frozen custard was until i moved here i hadnt even heard of it i tried it liked it and went on my merry little way my dad eats it  least twice a week and usually its his lunch i mean he is obsessed i dont find it that good it has a funky after taste i do love their banana splits tho they do need to make some choc custard bc vanilla mixed w choc syrup just doesnt cut it  the service is fantastic so dont freak out when you see a line a mile long before you know it youre at the front prices are reasonable i dont hate it but i dont think everyone has to like it its an edible frozen treat and sometimes does actually hit the spotif you are looking to stretch your dollar and get the most amount of decent quality food and live near the colleges look no further the food is good but defiantly not worth going out of your way to come here if you dont have a choice and have to get something in the area then this might be a good optionthis place is pretty standard when it comes to froyo in philadelphia  nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either  if you are in the area and get a serious craving not a bad place to stopexcellent ghost pepper beer along with smoked brisket sandwich with pit beans was very loud and we could not talk to people in our group too many tvs and way to loud for dinnernew owners keep shorter hours so just when youre strolling south street in the evening looking for dessert theyre closed  i dont see how such a business can survive on the stayathome moms and slackers who come by day and closes their doors when the throngs arrive on south street  new owner not as friendly as original said theyre related and unnecessarily defensive if you offer suggestions or make requests  they tried adding baked goods  and had some great chocolate cake that didnt catch on fast enough so they dropped it  poo  hard to find great cake    taking a wait and see attitude  will try them again  if we can catch them before they snap shut before 8pmi have mixed feelings about blue bell pizza  their plain ordinary pizza is just ok nothing great  same goes for their white neapolitan style pizza  however the grandma pie and the brooklyn both of which have thick crust and fresh mozzarella are really good  the greek salad is huge and always fresh  much better than most salads you get from a pizza joint    i am deducting points for how frustrating their service is i literally live on the same street as the business yet they have gotten lost multiple times trying to deliver to my house you dont even need to turn its the same road  last time i went to pick up no one was at the register and i had to call out to the back for a worker  then when they pointed out that my order was on the counter and then went right back into the kitchen i had to yell to them again to remind them i hadnt paid  if they improved their service we would definitely get pizza from here more oftenmeh friendly server painfully slow service very loud food was ok but nothing raveableok this is not innout burger  but an occasional alternative i find the taste of their burgers to only be average they remind me of a whopper at burger king their fries are not very tasty although the onion rings are good  i have co workers who rave about this place i just dont see it  it is not bad but not special eithergreat food but the waiter kept staring at my gf good job creepoanother vote for the grouper blackened or says one of the people on my group personally i found the restaurant to feel a little dirty cheap and predictable my food the shrimp was not great it wasnt disgusting but i didnt eat much of it the waiter seemed to impose rules on everything  sides fees for everything extra etc just didnt enjoy itlooks its fast foodwasnt as amazing as a hand made burger in a gastrointestinal pub but it was hot and tasted just fine  service was friendlybut then again i am in boiseits friendly everywhere  not much else to sayother than go boise statethe restaurant is really nice the food is okay the waitstaff isnt good at all took so long to get one drink that we didnt even have time to order a second ordered apps and food and half way through our main course we got our drinks  it was okay i wouldnt recommend it but its okayi drive by this place a lot and decided today i would try it   pros i ordered the mezza w falafel which is supposed to be a sampler platter the hummus was very good and so was the tabouli both tasted very fresh as well as the feta cheese and black olives the staff was friendly  cons i got my order to go and didnt check the container before i left the platter was supposed to come with pita bread to eat the hummus with i didnt get any and instead of kalamata olives i was given black olives also the music was a little too loud made it hard to hear the staff as he was making recommendations and so probably not a place i would sit down to eat with someone and hang out  i still think this place has potential ill go back to try some of the other menu items hopefully ill get whats described on the menu next timeking cakes are great they are just slightly disorganized theyll call you and threaten to sell your prepaid king cakesim always on the hunt for chocolate especially hot chocolate  we came specifically so i could try their hot chocolate    its a cute spot  someone on yelp mentioned there was plenty of parking but that is actually not the case    the parking lot is small and its in a residential area  luckily we found a spot on the street  hot chocolate big disappoint    well i guess im used to not finding good hot chocolate so maybe not that big of a disappointment  honestly its very rare to find places that make really good hot chocolate  most places like this particular visit make versions that taste just like hot milk  sometimes the drink just needs to be stirred but i tried that and it still tasted like hot milk  double chocolate donut i loved this though    if i was nearby i would stop by to grab some of these    my bf ordered a cappuccino and he said it was really good  im not a coffee drinker so i didnt try any coffee drinks  the stars were definitely just for the hot chocolateok so i rarley eat healthy stuff but wendys pecan chicken salad is my favorite thing ever i always ask for extra dressing because lets be real i cant eat a salad without it  downsideyou probably will have to as the cashier a few times for the extra dressing other than that the people at the drive thru are usually super friendly and patient as i order even when i have to wait a minute to get my fiances order    oh and their soft serve is on point chocolate milkshakes to die forthe drivethru service is trying my patience if its not someone dragging out their greeting a little too much wasting what little of my lunch break i have its someone rushing me when i place my order  today in particular i asked for a med 4 for 4 combo  she asked the drink i tell her and she then just asks if i want anything i havent even told her what sandwich i wanted  i tried to ask for the sandwich but she goes yeah yeah i got it  anything else  how rude can you possibly be  the service should be quick but the customer shouldnt be rushed especially when not asked the complete questions for the order  i paid i got my food but it wasnt how i tried to ask for it since the lady at the window rushed me  not even a bloody smile  i rushed back inside told them what happened and they give me my new sandwich without even a bloody apology  far be it for me to tell someone how to do their job but i used to work for a drive thru and even on my amateur days would i have worked circles around that worker  do better and be more thorough with taking orders no matter if its lunch rush or notnot that great went here for dinner with my husband recently he had the duck i had the grilled salmon both were sadly overcooked the duck was tough and the salmon was so dry that the only way i could swallow it was with a gulp of water im giving 3 stars because we had gone on a previous occasion and everything was goodwe literally visited this place the week it opened several years ago the same relatives were in town that went with us the first time they wanted to go back so we did   the parking is always a bit confusing and they were paving their lot so we parked on the street   the place is amazing looking i just wish the food was at the same level as the decor i really feel like they nailed the faux blues barbbq feel here it is a bit over the top but i do like it   so right off the bat i see they have a pastrami sandwich done   there were 6 people in our party so i ordered no pastrami none so on to a pulled pork sandwich which i knew better but i just wanted to eat and leave   everyone else ordered it took quite some time for our food to come out it was a dying off lunch crowd and was defiantly not packed not thrilled about that   our food came i kid you not i put so much seasoned salt and bbq sauce on the pulled pork sandwich that it should have overpowered it i could not get any flavor out of it i think it was the bun but all the same it was very bland   the ribs were good another member of our party ordered but a bit tough   someone ordered a caesar salad and man it looked weak the grilled cheese sandwich for the kids was barely toasted it was palecheese was good but bread was too much and not toasted   heres the bottom line to me if you really dont care about the overall taste of the food and want some room and a slightly loud environment to hang out in this is the place   if you are a foodie and want the best do not go here its ok thats it ok go to sugarfire or lil mickeysive been here over a dozen times the ice cream is ok i really dont get the hoopla over ice cream and to be honest i hate places that only accept cashvenue clean large with indoor and outdoor seating plenty of room for large and small groups even areas with a pretty romantic vibe  service horrendous our server literally hated her life or her job she came out to greet us and already was annoyed that she was about to serve 13 people who wouldve tipped her more than 20 had she showed some enjoyment out of her job she only got 20 because of that reason she was miserable we dont even know why we paid with 1 card we all ordered all at once we only asked for additional beers it was the easiest table to serve i just cant imagine why she is working in the service industry when she clearly does not enjoy it hurts the company and restaurant nonetheless this is about the food more than the service just had to mention it though  prices over the top pricey drinks to food small portions barely any alcohol in the mixed drinks just poor choice in costs when it comes to such poor qualities although the pizzas were enjoyed by everyone around the table but the other ancillary dishes were subpar the poutine not with poutine cheese the wings were bland  beers pricey but again had plenty of selection so everyone eventually found their top choice 2 tiny tiny flights there are many other breweries in the area that have better pricing and beer selection  i will say we ended up sitting outside in the humidity even though there were 3 large tables inside that had no one sitting at them they refused to let us sit there by the time we left 2 of those tables were still empty and remained open i dont understand their thinking behind refusing us we were a mix of all ethnicities and everyone was dressed well so i dont know how they judged us to stick us outside rather than let us opt for the inside table  unfortunately it was such a poor experience will not be back hope for future customers to beware and proceed with caution happy eating and drinkingthis place has quickly become our regular spot the ricotta cheese rosemary potatoes and beets salad are just delightful  aside from being a little too salty everything is good the ambiance the service the charm the location is five star the service four stars and the food was two at best clam chowder was okay but the bread bowl was stale and tough we also had a crab salad sandwich and it was just okay   pack a lunch and just eat at the pieri really wanted to like this place i got the philly style one it was soggy and super buttery for some reason maybe it was the mustardy mayo sauce that was on it pretty bland i ended up picking through the other half after eating the first and just ended up throwing away half of it ill have to try the komchi version next timeif i go backerroneously called more than just ice cream simply because the menu covers more than desserts is a little unfair because the only thing they do well is ice cream and desserts  ive had the food here and was pretty unhappy so were all of my friends everything felt a bit stale and also a little flavorless its our own fault for not knowing that no one comes here for dinner  luckily the desserts and ice cream concoctions make up for it pretty well ive had cupcakes shakes ice cream brownies etc you name it and all have been awesome nothing is fakesweet here everything is super sugary and delicious and thats the reason i keep coming back  word of advice to everyone else stick with the desserts they may serve more than just ice cream but that doesnt mean you should order itclean store rarely crowded well maintained and stocked store assoc here are  friendly and helpful the store is big enough to have variety but not so large that it overwhelms you or has 25 different kinds of table salt the only thing that keeps me from been a regular are the prices could be betterfor fast food i love the options   the variety of healthier meal choices is a real bonus the reason for the low score is due to the cleanliness of the tables  the dining area stays perpetually dirty even when the restaurant is not busybeer is decent and the outdoor seating is nice but the service was off when i visited the tasting room and that just made for bad experience the bar area got crowded and no one knew how to get the bartenders attention although once you got it they were pretty chill   the food area can get crowded if someone is picking up their food and youre trying to order the guy working the food prep area seemed annoyed at me for standing around waiting to order the food itself was decent peacemaker but pricey for what it was 15 for mussels 10 for a tiny portion of blue crab dip wone pretzel stick  eh its fine ill keep drinking the beer but wont go out of my way to return herecame in around 715 pm plenty of time before closing i thought and the girl working there seemed so angry that i came in that late she didnt ask how i was or anything just stood behind the counter looking annoyed the cupcake i got was pretty good but the customer service wasnt the bestservice was good the beer it took 4 samples to figure out my taste i went on a tuesday night so it was only a handful of people entertaining from the music the chairs at the bar are not comfortable i felt like sitting on the floor the bartender was cute lolchanged their menu since i was there last and regrettably did away with my favorite menu item the puntas i had the parillada tonight which is essentially fajitas without the tortillas which was strange needless to say i ordered a side of tortillas i liked that they had a veggie option of saitan for an extra 150 but also found it strange that the default meat for the dish was beef but if you wanted chicken it was an also an extra 150 not that its necessarily gone downhill over the years but it has definitely changed just not sure yet if its for the better love the byob thing thoughthe new york atmosphere is neat and the pizza is very good but the service is always really slow especially on lightning game daysi was really excited to try this place since its the first place ive heard of that has boba thai rolled ice cream and crepes its about a 15 minute drive from usf campus and the gps doesnt take you to the exact location which is within a large shopping plaza next to aldis market   there werent that many flavors of boba besides the staple flavors i opted to try was the galaxy tea which came in four flavors passionfruit mango strawberry and lychee it comes in a plastic light bulb cup and has basil seeds already included the drink tasted similar to lemonade and was very sweet most likely because i chose passion fruit it was interesting to taste but i wouldnt order it again the crepe menu has about 8 options you can choose from sweet or savory concoctions i ordered the fruit crepe that had blueberries strawberries bananas and kiwi i was really disappointed that my crepe was cold when i got it and the filling was mediocre the fruits were fresh but the crepe itself was chewy and bland so it wasnt enjoyable to eat   overall i feel like this place has potential if they were to improve the quality of the crepe and had a larger drink selectioni wanted chinese fast food so i checked this out  java b had said this location was the better one over the plumb ln location  i went on that recommendation and i agree  i pulled into the 15 minute parking space and went in  they were packed all the seating outside was occupied and most of the tables inside were also full  i walked in and was helped immediately  they were very nice and the place was very clean  i was impressed with the cleanliness as some expressed that it was an issue  i was there around 115  the height of lunch hour  i was out of there in about 7 minutes  the food was what you would expect  it was good  i dont expect spectacular for fast food but i was good with it  for what it is if you want chinese fast food in a clean place this will serve your needsi stopped here for a hot second to kill some time waiting for my mom and overall i enjoyed it  i had a nice cup of tea and was able to enjoy being outside for one of the last nice days of fall  they have a fair amount of outdoor seating which is nice and the inside looked pretty cozy too  no complaints heregreat pancakes it would be 5 stars if i rated solely on pancakes my sons french toast was soggy but he didnt seem to mind  not the most kid friendly no kid menu so i had to get my 4 year old an adult sized meal and even though we were only one of 3 tables there early in the morning i felt hurried my kids were behaving nicely and no we didnt make or leave a big mess the waiter actually started to take my sons plate away while he still had half the food on it was chewing and had his fork in his hand but give it a try really those pancakeswent there today late brunch at 130  not a fancy place no line  not a fancy place  waiter very attentive  slow service  we had sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon syrup  delicious but they were kinda baby ones  veg egg white omelet was ok with raw veggies just dumped on top of the omelet  guess its a pancake place not an omelette place the place was aight  i would not saw they have the best dessert but its interesting if you have a date and want a place to experience come to this spot  not badthis place is the definition of nofrills the food is decent and plentiful the decor pretty standard another reviewer called it a hole in the wall and the description fits you order at the counter but it can get dicey if you havent grabbed a  table first if the place is crowded otherwise you might end up with a plate of hot food on the curbgood burgers good beer on tap last two times have had same server and shes sooo slow she insists on waiting multiple tables before putting orders in and waiting on multiple orders before serving drinks to tables yes this method limits her trips tofrom bar but sometimes people need a water would be a 4 or even 5 star if got different service had better service on 1st of the 3 visitsdelicious fresh corn tortillas cooked daily in the store  wonderful produce but really iffy packaged deli meats and cheeses  good dates but mold and even water in packages  great place to shop if you know what youre doing and store has a welcoming multicultural atmospherethere is no doubt that the food here is first rate  the flavors are fresh and authentic sicilian and the antipasto is possibly one of the best i have ever eaten  there was sweet spicy savory cheeses  it was phenomenal and artfully put together  i could have licked the plate of the lamb ragout that accompanied the pillowy light potato gnocchi and my husband reminisced about our own trips to italy with the grilled sardine appetizer her enjoyed  but the dining experience here was dreadful  my husband and i couldnt hear each other talk across the table so we just didnt talk through most of the meal which made us look like a couple on an awkward first date  you dont have an assigned server instead the multiple servers in the dining room flit around like vultures waiting to snag an empty plate  theres no warmth no friendliness no sicilian family feeling  the gentleman at the table next to ours tipped our bread basket forward every time he leaned back in his chair but we left the basket there instead of switching it with the drinks on the other side  as the evening wore on the restaurant became quite dark and some white bright table cloths would have gone a long way to add warmth and light to the place  again if you are going for delicious food and ambiance is not a priority definitely go to zeppoli to enjoy the amazing food  but after waiting a couple of months to snag a table we wanted a whole wonderful dining experience  we definitely didnt get thatwe used to love their pizza but have been seriously disappointed lately the last few pizzas weve ordered have been super doughy in the middle and undercooked to the point of being mushy think raw biscuit dough even when we ask for well done when we take advantage of their carry out specials we end up putting the pizzas in our over at home to try to finish them off i dont know where the disconnect is between asking for well done and getting underdone pizza but were now in the market for a new goto pizza optioni happened upon this little bakery in oliver while waiting to meet with someone over at the mcdonalds and decided to pop in to see if they had hamburger buns in an attempt to save myself a trip over to safeway   i got service immediately and was greeted by a very enthusiastic young woman i did end up up purchasing a package based solely on the fact they smelt so darn good but was slightly shocked at the price they are smaller than your typical grocery chain buns but the price jump obviously comes from the fact they are organic  upon using them with our burgers however i was quite surprised with how much better they tasted then the prior mentioned grocery store chain buns so i must admit i am torn about my experience if value and quantity is what is important to you then i recommend sticking with the big grocery stores but if you want something high quality and healthy and can handle paying a bit more these guys are a great choice  i will definitely come back for a coffee and individual baked good if i am in the neighborhood again but i dont think my wallet could handle regular purchases hereaverage is the best description for the corner cafe the food is pretty average and the variety is also average i had a cheese steak and cheese fries on one occasion and a bacon cheeseburger griller on another the cheese steak was alright but the wiz on the fries was your basic salty cheese product my second trip however the sourdough griller i had was actually pretty good the service both times was ok and the atmosphere is fine i feel like the owners are really trying to make it a good cafe in royersford they just need some tweaking and alittle more effort they could become a staple by diversifying the menu even more advertising in the community more and uping the service a bit i wish the best of luck an average place to eat and i recommend if you are looking for ok food for a decent pricesince day one i have been in love with this place my first experience with friends was delightful i had the duck confitvery salty but it was rich and satisfying i absoultely fell in love with the dossaints my only complaint is the past 2 times i stopped by just to pick up a dossaint they had ran out i even called at 10am to see if they had any and they ran out mind you it was 10 am i highly suggest they  have their inventory checked out before they lose more business the eclectic mannerism doesnt help either get with it peoplei love a good burger and red robin makes a fairly good burger but i have trouble giving a restaurant that serves its food in plastic baskets and charges 1012 dollars a meal more than 3 stars   i ordered a burger with a special set of toppings and it came out exactly as ordered my wife the vegetarian even was able to get a vegan burger made by boca with avacado and other toppings the food was delivered almost to quickly we were barely able to enjoy our drinks before they arrived   overall we had a good experience and we just wanted something cheap and quick so it is a winner for that reasontypical fast food americanized mexican the young lady at the counter was very sweet and got our orders right service with a smile she bid us a good day when we were leaving   food came out fast and they got all the orders right the womens bathroom was clean and well stocked as well if i were in a pinch id go back to this locationthe place is nice the service was friendly and efficient and the owner is a pretty nice guy they dont serve food but had a food truck on site so sustenance is available if needed the beers were well made and free of off flavors but nothing wowed me although the el heffe was quite tasty definitely worth trying out plenty of house beers on tap and nice people working there if you like craft beer you should definitely stop byi was disappointed the man making my taco salad didnt know what pinto beans were they charged me for a steak salad when i had a chicken salad if that was a salad where was the lettuce  not likely to visit againthis is a funky little place to eat ive only had breakfast here and it was typical greasy diner food they are known for their milkshakes but since ive never tried them i cant tell you how good or bad they are some might call the decor of this place charming but i honestly dont know what to think of it youll just have to decide for yourselfim a bit surprised by the negative reviews so far  maybe things have changed  ill keep this short and to the point i went last week after realizing jakes was closed and still craving a burger  i remembered that zacs took over for 5 guys so i figured id give it a shot  i had a standard baconcheeseburger with extra cheese as well as an order of waffle fries  the burger was good  it wasnt jakesfive guys but it was close  it was cooked properly tasted good and the bacon was cooked perfectly   the waffle fries were real good  they were the seasoned kind so less chickfila and more arbys curly fry flavor    i didnt have a chance to try the milkshake but will next time  heres the thing about zacs  the burgers arent as good as jakes and the fries arent as good as five guys  the fries are good the burgers are good just not as good as the more known establishments  considering jakes is closed and 5 guys gone this makes a fine and serviceable replacement    go in with moderate expectations and i think youll be pleased  if youre going for the next jakes or five guys skip zacs and go to jakes or five guys  if youre looking for a pretty good burger andor pretty good fries give zacs a shot  dont believe all the negativity because its not bad  form your own opinion but just give it a fair shoti was starving and stopped off at moes for some lunch first time visitor to this chain i had a chicken burrito bowl with black beans peppers cooked onions pico de gallo lettuce and cheese tasty liked the idea they included salsa and chips with any order   whats really cool is their coke freestyle machine it makes 106 flavors nice concept  the place is casual and fast the ingredients tasted fresh and the price was reasonableour group of five stopped in for dinner before a local meeting  we were seated immediately and the restaurant was not very busy  our orders were taken promptly and our food was delivered fairly quickly  the food was quite good and nobody had any complaints about their order  the waitress was young but seemed to know what she was doing  the prices for the meals were very reasonable and we left happy  the only issue we encountered was during the paying of the bill  if you want to split out individual meals make sure you say so before they produce the final ticket  they dont have an easy ability to do so after the fact  we will definitely be backi was pleasantly surprised by the good flavor of this pizza while the prices are a little on the high side for chain pizza they regularly have coupons that run a decent dealsecond time here first review had the bowl with chicken yellow rice and vegetable onions tomato side of pollo bites and plantains chicken was good but needed a little more seasoning plantains were very good and the pollo bites seemed to have been frozen food not made on site overall a good place for lunch floor was a little greasy when walking i would come backfirst visit at this firehouse subarrived at 330ordered my subi was only customer in therethere were three employees behind the counter there was not one table that was cleaned offfood on the floorlast time at that locationif you enjoy light lunches and are concerned about food truck mishaps  you can depend on the fishin chicken food truck to be a safe choice  im not one to make safe choices though the fishin chicken was near my workplace for lunch so i ordered the jerk chicken taco the taco i gave it 3stars  it depends on what you want out of it at the time i wanted some real jerk caribbean style the jerk chicken wasnt truly authentic and ive done had the real stuff but if youre an overall safe eater and want just a bit of flavor you can cheat knowing youve cheated on the healthiestcleanest version  id still buy again from them the service was great and they got orders out quickso i really wanted this place to rock our world but alas it falls short  youre in the right ballpark bgood but execution is where you need work    1st i dont want to be rushed while reading your board to order our lunch  you guys may know whats up there by heart but we dont  2nd im glad the food came out quickly but what the heck i just spent 30 and am still way hungry  3rd the buddha bowl concept is great with the local fresh produce but a little more dressing and more than 2 tablespoons of quinoa please  were going to chipotle for the main course i guess   not returningthe food was alright nothing to be excited about it was filling and satified my taste buds but given the choice i would go else whereit wasnt very crowded on a friday evening so i was able to sit at a high top with family we ordered the tilapia special with orzo and the special burrito the entrees and nacho app were nothing to really phone home about but their donuts are amazing it doesnt hurt that there is also a bar inside decor is nice and the waitstaff were polite and friendlythe food was fantastic but the service was not so great our server disappeared halfway through our meal i told our server it was my boyfriends birthday when we arrived and he said he would make it special for him but we never saw him again the food was great though i highly recommend the skillet tacos and natural margaritaeverything is great about panda i normally used to give 4 stars but im taking one off since they took forever to serve the food for me i was the only person at that time standing in line to order the girl said she will be back in a sec but she turned up after 23 min and by that time the queue grew to 10 peoplesince the new renovations the floor is lacking drink girls big time theres just not enough of them the ones that do come around and take a drink order usually never come back i always tip no matter what another thing several of the machines are out of order glitchy or completely gone some of the machines i like have been moved or theyre gone forever  just when i find some i like they get moved or theyre broken as far as the hotel rooms go theyre nice but overpriced big time good things for comps or id never stay and playoysters very good raw and baked but service was very slow and not very customer friendly waitress was awful and not sure she really wanted to serve our 10 top food was ok but dont think ill ever returnmediocre the staff isnt super great eitherseems like a bunch of angry hipsters versus friendly hipstersmy go to wawa  well stocked and you can gas up    interesting clientele ranging from upscale to the homeless  staff ranges from very friendly and helpful to distracted and zoned out  parking lot can be a bit of a free for all if you hit it at peak hoursto be truthful ive had better pizza i felt that the italian dinners were skimpy but ok for the prices the food wasnt badthis is an acceptable place to get frozen custard if you are closer to mr wizards than to ted drewes  the frozen custard and concretes are not as good or as consistent as ted drewes  for example if you get something such as a reeses peanut butter cup concrete the mixin is distributed in a very uneven manner  by the time you get to the bottom third of the concrete there wont be any more of the mixin it will only be frozen custard  one other note  mr wizards has a sign stating that they wont take credit cards below a specific dollar amount  why is this  its not like the dollar amount of the transaction changes the interchange fee percentage  also this policy is in violation of their agreements with the credit card companiesthe name of this place sounded quite inviting located close to several airline gates ideal for getting a quick sandwich before boarding the plane  stick with the premade wraps or salads if you are in a hurry the sandwiches can take upwards of 20 minutes for them to make  the 5 cheesecake scoop was average in taste little bit larger than a golf ball way too sweet for someone used to new york style cheese cake consistency was of a thick vanilla pudding the basic cheesecake mix is then garnished with different toppings caramelized nuts chocolate chips oreo cookies  to make the other flavors available on the menu you may want to stick to the plain cheesecake as the toppings bring even more sugar and make the already too sweet cheesecake into a sugar rush my sandwich was ok but after eating about half of it was disappointed to find a hair in it see photo at which point i lost my appetite next time i will check the sandwich before boarding the planehospitality was great food was ok i ordered the fettuccine alfredo it wasnt good i dont know what it was about it but but sauce was just gross i dont know how you mess up alfredo sauce but it wasnt good the pizza rolls were great and i loved them but the alfredo just wasnt good good service thoughi tend to be more of a coffee purist and im not a chai guy so i really come here because its popular with the crowd  the coffee is good middle of the pack in this neighbourhood and the food smells great but i guess i dont thing of it as a restaurant and generally im not there at meal times  our typical time at remedy is spent talking over a coffee beer or chai  its got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby sugar bowl and id say a more bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street  its more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings  this end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot  there are a couple of sushi spots a couple of diners a couple of espresso cafes a really decent pho place and with sugar bowl and remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee along with indian food before popping into the garneau for some art houseterrific food and beer awful service you could eat the beer cheese dip and bread as a meal its delightful the sprecher cherry cola that they offer is almost as good as their beer its very crowded when the weather is nice because its right off the mononi finally gave this place a chance during my last visit having seen what appeared to be better reviews their case was full of fresh baked good but i was in the mood for cowboy it wasnt bad but it wasnt superb it probably would have awesome were it not for the slow service that may have made it coldfirst the good beautiful interior great beer and drinks good separation of the bar from the dining room now the bad poor value for dollar spent french onion soup one of my favorites for evaluation super salty thin broth with two tiny slivers of onion not even up to campbell soup quality fries mealy and barely warm sandwiches thin and needing more meat kitchen slow and server kept forgetting items ordered kids meals only thing somewhat on point but even they said fries were iffy on first visit we always order from the middle of the menu and we were glad not to waste too much money i suggest the manager actually try the food for freshness and quality might open their eyes otherwise a good spot for meeting and drinking eat elsewhere just a side note while waiting for our food the couple next to us called the manager over and told him the food was terrible this was midmeal one of them paid and just left should have been our heads up of what was comingsalmon was fresh the hotpot with fish eggs was not good pho noodle soup was terrible melons were not fresh  if u like shabu shabu the dinner will work for you otherwise try 11 lunchdonuts were pretty good not amazing not as amazing for all the hype i did not really enjoy the 2 that i had i guess im more of a traditional kind of donut eater and this is not traditional at all im not from st louis and am in town on business and so i was picking up a dozen all the guys in the office enjoyed them so thats what matteredit was fine but i found it did not live up to the hype i had the georgia peach pancakes and it was good but not life changing it was nice to do for the experience and to see what the hypes about but not a mustdofirst off lets get the positive points through  good pizza fresh ingredients and good portions  the salads are great as well  service is pretty good too  they accidentally brought me a medium pizza when i ordered a large made up for it by bringing me a second medium for free  my main beef with this joint can be summed in one word flies  been there 3 times in the last 6 months or so and there are always an abundance of nasty flies everywhere  but theyre good people with good foodreality set in for me came back to earth good for a brew pub but still a brew pub   last visit was ok to good food was good enough maybe a little flat service was more the issue certainly ok but not attentive some long waits to find server and we needed her plus starting out was a little rough longer wait than expected   tried again last night noisy and crowded no patio seating went elsewhere inside was a little rough from all the previous activity plus always freezing cold inside inside isnt for us   every bit of 3 stars just not morethe highs  prompt service food delivered fast and hot  great pancakes and large portions  solid blueplate breakfast the lows  the coffee  drip generic blah  nothing fancy  the bacon was limp thin and generic  food was probably sysco straight out of the truck except for the pancakes  however for the portions the price was right and nothing was belowpar by any stretch of the imagination except for the coffee   recommended  go for the pancakes the bloody marys and bring your cafeaulait with youi love the archiecture more then anything it was a very impressive place to be at the end you were given two free beverages i went with the pumpkin and stella   what else can be said about a brewery tour you do have the option to choose between the fast tour which routes you to the beer samples right away or the extended which takes you along the streets and into several buildings for a more detailed tour   go on the extended your first time from then on out skip to the fast routed tournickie the server was absolutely amazing and professional loved the surf and turf special she offered i have to agree that the sushi is absolutely scrumptious fulfilling and the portion size is great the reason im giving it a 3 star is due to the fact of the unprofessionalism and disrespect of a kitchen staff that was visible to the front of the bar i believe his name is felipe and clearly he didnt know i spoke spanish but everything coming out of his mouth was ruining our experiencei have to agree that the place has slipped ive been in a few times as i dont want an off day to hurt the stores rating they have reduced the amount of varieties and the finishes are just not as good   as i said i was in a few times but this past sunday was the last straw i know its mothers day so i called ahead to ask if i needed to place an order for my donuts they said no just come early i was there at 8am and they were out of glazed donuts and had very limited selection i asked the owner the very nice asian lady and she said her husband did not make extra donuts for mothers day just the normal amount if anyone thinks 8am was late thats because i went to paoli first and they were out already they have good donuts and bagels but please get your act together or just hire someone from dunkin donuts to teach you how to project your orders oh yeah i know this because thats where i ended up getting my donuts from they had plenty of donuts and even had heart shaped donuts with sprinkles for mothers dayservice not great and food feels very rushed overall just okayi came here on a free saturday afternoon and they were fairly busy but i was helped almost immediately they had a very small selection but i probably shouldve gotten there earlier in the day the layout of this place is weird theres a case of macaroons in the center all the sweets laid out all looked very cute but i went there on a macaroon hunt i got a case of 6 a variety of flavors their boxes are cute i will say their wait staff is really stuck up the guy helping me did not seem like i was the type of person he wanted to wait on i also got some home made marshmallows and it cost me 17 so the people are rude and its expensive its very cute though and my macaroons were tastygreat bagels in the area its not an easy task these days finding a great bagel here the bagels are great and fresh they offer a great variety of favors the only challenge i have is the service to me is slow and it is cold and unfriendlyvzcmy family and i used to be huge fans of don pablos we would probably go at least once per week but we were converted by on the border i can definitely say that on the border is the best local place for mexican their food is consistently good and i dont think theyve ever messed up an order of mine the only downside is that the service here can be incredibly slow ive had several trips to on the border where my waiter only came to my table three times when we ordered when he brought out our food and to give us the check while the food is great the service definitely leaves something to be desiredit is difficult not to like this place some welltraveled friends recommended it to us when we were in the area the setting is romantic and friendly the food was not memorable but i would give it a second chanceso far of all the beer i have tasted at the nola breweries this brewery has the best to my taste  the space is pretty cool being in an old movie theater while the geographic location can be a bit on the shady side and challenging to find if you dont know where you are going  the kristalweizen and scotch ale were my top choices and i would enjoy drinking mass quantities of those  the space is set up much more like a bar than a lot of the other spots with indoor bench seating like a german biergarten but no outside patio seating  they also have some random food pop ups    beer prices start at 5 and go up from there which i found pretty pricey for a beer in this locale even if it is some craft fancy stuff it is still just beer in the end and i would drink a lot more of it at 4 than at 5  maybe give locals and beer professionals that commit to 6 or more beers a quantity discount  maybe sell in a proper bavarian liter glass for a better quantity and discount for those dedicated to the beer consumption artsenjoyed the sushi i had the lunch special with 2 rolls florida and spicy salmon soup and salad  personally i would prefer it cost less and only get soup or salad  also had a spicy tuna roll  disappointments  they dont have hot green tea   part of their philosophy is sustainabilityimpact on the environment so im confused why they are using plastic disposable cups for soy sauce disposable chop sticks and bottled drinkssoda  most of the bottles were glass so pretty easy to recycle but i wonder if they really are recycling  bottom line would i go back  yes if im in the immediate area  but i dont think i would make a trip out to go there specificallybest beer and brewery in indy sadly loses huge points for lack luster service ive been numerous times and they are quick to get rid of you met one of their brewers once and the guy was awesome and showed me a lot this place would be the best if the servers were happier and better at customer serviceinsider tip this location of noodles has the availability to make buffalo mac  cheese and off the menu item i just went for lunch today it is deliciousthe service was great but the juice only comes in a medium cup i watched one gal throw away the rest she couldnt give the rest to me in the large cup no the rest was not foam there was still lots of juice i could go to tree city and get a large for the exact same price dont think ill be back anytime sooni love coming here for thanksgiving bc their stuffed turducken is so darn delicious the only downside is that their products are pricey last time i brought a turducken was 7080 that was a few years agobob was a great tour guide but i definitely expected more food for the food tour when they say sample size they mean it i was hoping for at least a small appetizer size portion in actualitiy you get a sauce size portion  dont go on the tour hungrygood standard for the nola area  ive been several times but it seems that the prices creep up each time i go in  fast service nononsense menu  food good but the last time i was there i saw a bug crawling on the countertop ewwww  may switch back to cafe du monde drive thrulet me start by saying i love donuts every city i travel to i find the local spot to indulge and i thought district donuts would be appropriate donuts looked good and the local vibe of the shop was appealing   i ordered a variety of donuts and was disappointed to find that all of them lacked flavor it was hard to tell which donut was a certain flavor because they all appeared bland and boring i would say the wedding cake donut was my favorite because the texture somewhat resembles a wedding cake   the coffee here really stole the show i would return for an iced coffee but not a donuti was in town visiting my bff who has moved there recently and we wanted sushi so dammit we got sushi   ru sans showed us a great time especially since we were in the mood to partay bday extravaganza followed our lovely dinner every time and i mean every time someone orders a sake bomb they do the restaurantwide yelling thing plus its generally kind of small and really loud so not great if youre looking to chat or catch up whatevs thats fine we can chat later haha sake bombs  as far as the food it was good nothing to write home about but good my bff did get an obscure roll  i cant remember the name of it for the life of me but it looked like five rolls stuck together in the shape of a flower were deep fried toget and then cut off as large flower shaped slices it was weird and impossible to eat and just weird   the service was good again nothing spectacular or memorable price was reasonable for the 4 people we had eating there   all in all an aok experienceyou know when someone tries to do so many things that they cant really do any of them well thats exactly how i feel about cafe square one   their menu is super extensive and they boast that you can pretty much make any accommodation you wish which is nice for those picky souls ive had an array of items here from salads to bagels and i wasnt very impressed with any of them service is friendly but very slow even when youre the only customer   the smoothies are a solid 4stars though and i will certainly return for thoseive been to bullys before and the food was wonderful but tonight was just poor  first they were out of rribs and slaw rreally at 730 on a saturday night  they were out of pork steaks and hush puppies as well   hard to believe they would be out of food this early in the evening  we ordered the pulled pork plate  it came out cold  the pork was room temperature at best  fried corn was watery and mealy flavor  broccoli was warm not hot  fries and sweet potatoes were hot and tasty  overall the meal sucked  we did get one meal removed from the bill when we finally got to talk with our waitress  they were very busy so unfortunately we rarely saw our serverpeople rave about this place and the dan dan noodles they proudly display a banner that says cnn rated one of the top 50 chinese restaurants in the us i guess maybe the flagship location is manayunk which could be better than exton ive been to exton and royersford several times and it does not impress me like i hoped it would i keep going back though hoping things will turn around i should probably mention i lived in two different cities in china for over 6 months each and have a good understanding of authentic cuisine the dan dan noodles just do not do it for me i think people rave about them because no other chinese restaurant around has a dish like this so maybe it is new to them the dumplings are good but totally not authentic at all and most recently i was here and the menu seemed a bit different the entrees was just a list of maybe 12  16 different styles of food which i thought was a very odd way to present your menu if you do decide to go you should definitely try the eggplant this was good enough to make me want to come back again and get that with something newdecent wine and beer selection and friendly staff for the quick bottle or six pack  but i usually make the trip to joe canals if we are entertaining a big groupour first clue that things were going to be alright here was the influx of many asians coming to dinner you know it makes you feel better to see that it was nice to find a decent vietnamese place in indy while in town for work the bun bo hue beef noodle soup was savory and a little spicy the pho was fine but the goi ga shredded chicken and cabbage salad was just swimming in nuoc mam when it really should just be lightly flavored with it otherwise the decor was nice the service was fine and there was even some funny people watching there was a nonasian family celebrating the wifemoms birthday and the husband was explaining loudly to the table that saigon was a city in vietnamese then proceeded to explain this to the vietnamese server as well thankyou clueless guy for the show with my dinnerive never been a beer drinker but i am a dork and i like to know how things work  this is why i went ahead and did the ab tour when i had some friends in town  it was really interesting to see how the brewery has grown over the years and how they actually go about making the beer  this is a good thing to do when you have outoftown visitors  its also nice not for me but for people who like beer that you get 2 free samples at the end of the tour  my friends husband was especially happy about that since he got my free samplesthis place is aok nothing spectacular to add quick regular sandwich and able to use the wifi from the place next door not much business when i was here so i was able to chill at a booth for a whilewow this is crazy indulgent greasy hangoverapproved food i think i got the humpty dumpty burger which was literally loaded with everything and anything including a drippy egg on top it was good but the simple burger with lettuce and tomato that my boyfriend had was nothing special it was especially disappointing because of the pretty penny he paid for it   in conclusion it seems like the special burgers are the way to go to get a good deal at 500 degrees i wouldnt even bother with the fries since they are around 4 each and super overseasoned imoi gotta settle on the same stores i have to have written more reviews for grocery stores than any yelper this is a newer publix the deli line moved quickly they had all the brands i was looking for the selection is vast  there is a good assortment produce was fresh staff was friendly  helpful  checkout lines were not long yeah cashier was friendly nut what is up they dont offer to take your groceries to your car anymore that stinks whats a girl to do i gotta lug them upstairs guess i am supposed to lug them out of the store35 stars   the decor was nice and the guy that helped me out as really friendly i saw some fruit flies in the far left muffin case and was a bit turned off about getting anything in there  their creme brulee truffle was really good and melts in your mouth  i really like the almond wedding cupcake i didnt care much for the frosting but the cake was delicious one of my favorites  their red velvet was aok ive had way better i wouldnt recommend itthe coffee is good but over priced super convenient location which is probably what you are paying for we got our coffee in to go cups when we did not ask for them and it was not much coffee in the cup the big room is renovated and has some cool elements but is missing the cozy feel that coffee shops beckon staff was not very enticing eitherbraised pork rice  favorite dish of the night highly recommended i would say its above average i would have given 2 stars if not for this dish  oyster omelette  first time trying this it tastes pretty much exactly like how its sound i wouldnt get it again too much red sauce it was watered down ketchup or something  zha jia mian  it was just meh i wouldnt get again   pork blood pork stomach tofu dish on the chinese menu bottom left  it was just okay the flavor was a bit strong i wouldnt get again  stinky tofu  first time trying it didnt like this kind of fried tofusadly this place is unimpressive i came here craving oatmeal so i ordered oatmeal and sausage the oatmeal can in s dry block it had yogurt and berries on top it dry and unpleasant the sausage was very good it taste fresh i can only give this place 3 stars because it wasnt impressive  im open to giving it another try on day maybe oatmeal isnt their thingserver wasnt friendly and didnt explain salsa choices to us food was average nothing out of this world i did like how they had whole wheat tortilla options for a healthier choice guac was average chips were light and nothing felt super heavy which was a pluswe went here on a sunday evening at 820 they gave us seating outside and informed that their kitchen closes at 9 we were ready to order everything by 825pm no one came to ask for water or take order there was one waitress outside service other 4 tables but kept smiling at us and did not stop by finally at 845 i called inside and requested to be served so finally someone came outside to help us with water and get us wine glasses so our first experience was not that good  the only reason why this place gets 3 stars os because the food was very good and tasty the place is also byob with no corkage fees they give free chips n salsa salsa was descent too although our chips took 45 mins to arrive and came with our apps instead of upfront for food we ordered their friend banana with beef and chicken with saffrin rice for entrees recommend this place for food but be prepared for lowsy service note dont forget to try their deablo sauce a little goes a long wayaside from being sparkling new what really distinguishes noboru from the more well known sushi buffet in the suburban philly area minado is the selection of korean dishes  you can get a made to order stew ie korean seafood tofu  the person behind the counter will give you a number and when its ready a server will deliver it to your table  the salmon skin pressed sushi triangle was delicious  the wings in the hot foods section was also pretty good  i will agree that the sushi selection seemed limited in comparison to minado but i thought it was of the same quality sushi was aok and sushi rice was not hard  in the states buffet sushi is hardly ever going to be spectacular thats just the truth   lunch on weekends is about 17person a fair price    will be back to try the shabushabu offered at dinner timegood food pretty greasy but surprisingly expensive 16 for a standard cheeseburger fries and drinkoverall experience ok chicken dry but beer cheese soup good wife loves portabello sandwich staff very friendly but kept thinking to myself i just paid premium price for chicken that mcdonalds could have done better with also no tomatoes available because they grow their own well if weather is in season where you cant grow them how about running down to the restaurant depot and getting somewe went to crabby bills on our first trip here and had a great conversation with the waitress  she was a transplant from new hampshire and a swimmer so had an interest in common with one of my daughters  this cbs is right across from the beach there is another at the marina which we went to as well following our fishing excursion  there they prepared our catch from a fishing excursion have posted picture  both cbs are comfortable beach side restaurants  nothing overly fantastic or incredibly disappointing  that said i could see myself visiting again on my next tripwe stayed here for my birthday one year  over priced and over rated  the room was nice but not worth 250 night  at that price everything in the room and mini fridge should have been included  even if you take the items out of the fridge and put it back it charges you  make sure to let the hotel staff know about the items you didnt consume i also left with a few bug bites the next day  i know they allow pets in their rooms so i dont know if fleas were the culprit  the casino was fun but of course expensive as expected  i would return to the casino and restaurants but i will not stay in the hotel againtoday was our first visit the food was good and the server was very nice the only unpleasantness was from the order taker we found her to be curt and dismissive well give it another goive only had one experience with this place and i want impressed though my wife enjoyed her breakfast she had the beni eggs benedict  i think beyond bread has far superior pastries just across the street kouing aman is amazing  cronut was sub par and cant remember the other food i had because it wasnt very memorable  i really wanted to like this place baked goods are my favorite  i do plan to give it another shot and will update my review if my opinion changesordered a miso praline and olive oil donut and it was delicious it just didnt taste like miso or olive oil there was bacon on it which pretty much overpowered the flavor but it was still one of the best donuts ive had fluffy and not overly greasy considering the increase in gourmet donut shops in los angeles   also got a 12 oz cold brew which wasnt very acidic but the flavor wasnt smooth for my liking total for the two was 6 i would still recommend to give district a trydid lunch special good not great  should have opted for a more traditional dish off of the main menu egg rolls  sweet  sour sauce were very goodthe sushi here is pretty solid albeit a little too pricey for my liking i tend to go here if i plan on eating in the restaurant or when i have a particular craving for spicy scallop rolls which they do quite well the staff is friendly and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated i just wish the prices were a tad lower for lunch ive spent 16 on a lunch here a lot higher than id pay other placesdecided to give this place a try as we love supporting local businesses that are eco friendly so it makes me sad to report that we most likely wont be going back the food was good but a couple of the waitresses just dont look happy to be there and we didnt get one smile from either of them the entire time ive been a waitress i understand it can be a tough job and maybe not what you want to be doing on a sunday but customer service still really matters there was a guy there who was really nice and friendly but unfortunately the 2 women bring down the vibe of the place sad because i really wanted to like it its a very cute cozy place with antique looking toys for kids and a good menu but like i said it just didnt vibe for us definitely worth giving it a try and hopefully youll have a different experiencei hover between aok and i am a fan for the following reasons i am old i like to sit down and i dont want too much noise  fortunately we were early on a weeknight and got a booth some nice food a whole side of a clash album had not heard that album in a while so sang along gaily  on a weekend i fear my old bones would crumble with the crush in here  methinks the big old fire chamber or shmelter or whatever it was  would have to become my personal vip spot cocktails as always excellently crafted by the owners prices are to be expected to be in line for this brooklyn cool people keep wittering about a good addition to the scene but not for date nighti got crepes here a couple days ago and i wasnt impressed the only place ive ever bought crepes before was at the bellagio in las vegas so maybe my expectations are highi ordered them to go and by the time i got to my car 2 minute walk the crepes were cold they werent very soft and didnt taste that great i couldve made better ones at home   on that note their gelato is delicious so if youre going there try the gelatoconvenient for essentials like milk bread and eggs since im a block away but other than that its just an overpriced and overrated haven for people who will actually pay 8 for a jar of tomato sauce because it has an organic label smacked on it  its tomato sauce    i always find myself settling for the cheapest thing because the prices are so high  ive never had a problem with any of the products ive purchased except for the one time i thought i bought shredded cheese it was the cheapest on the rack  4 which is still ridiculous only to go home and discover its fake imitation cheese most likely made of soy  i put it on my tacos and it tasted okay but when i tried to make nacho cheese out of it by melting it in the microwave it solidified into a hard gooey ball of orange  cheese shouldnt do that  word to the wise unlike me read the labels carefully before you buy something vegan when you dont want vegan   the store itself is way too crowded and the aisles leave you hardly any room to stop your cart and peruse the selections  for some reason every time i go there about nine workers are roaming the aisles with handtrucks unloading boxes right where i need to be  if shoprite were closer id go there instead  on the plus side the daily meal deals in the deli section are actually really worth it you get a decent sized entree and two sides from a wide variety of healthy and fresh options depending on the day it varies from 6 poultry to 8 pasta or beef  to 10 fish  the london broil is really good and the balsamic chicken is cooked perfectly  plus you cant go wrong with any of the sidesstopped by for dinner during a weekend trip to philly from nyc walked in on a sat night without a reservation and the wait was 2 hours long for a party of 4 my friends and i managed to get seats at the bar so we just ordered food and beer at the bar instead of waiting 2 hours for a table the atmosphere is trendy  the bar area is very long and spacious but it eventually got really crowded through the evening i noticed there were maybe only 1520 dining tables towards the back of the restaurant  goodluck getting seated at a table  honey whiskey wings  the sauce was sweet but thats pretty much it there was no depth in flavor cant really taste any whiskey in the sauce  nothing too special in my opinion  mussels in manhattan clam chowder  yummy i wanted to soak every last drop of the chowder with bread the mussels also had good flavor disco fries  i really wanted to like this dish handcut fries with peas ham chucky cheese sauce and top with a perfectly poached egg it sounded and looked amazing but i found the fries too soggy  really greasy the sauce was bland it definitely sounded better than it tasted green beans in almond butter this side dish was surprisingly wonderful probably my favorite dish of the night the beans were perfectly cooked crunchy and seasoned well the butter sauce was dreamy and i love the touch of almond every ingredient in the dish made sense and worked great together   lots of beer on tap its definitely a good spot for a quick bite and drinks with friendsthe burger bread fell apart when youre trying to eat it my pia colada it was delicious with ice cream on top but i would not recommend going here for the food quality weve had better quality burgers in the freezer section at whole foodsthe people are very very nice and friendly and the food is pretty reasonably priced but the chicken is just average to me i know i know walts the prize of northern delawares fried chicken but its just ok in my mind its overly crispy and it isnt salted enough and i dont even like a lot of salt on my food but it says a lot about the chicken when you need more salt to hide the blandness also what the hell is up with the rolls generic 3 by 3 inch white flour rolls i mean i wasnt expecting cracker barrelesque rolls but they should be embarrassed by what they put out overall theyre not awful but i probably wont be going back if youre in the area and want some good chicken try out the new semos on west 9th street or royal farms or kfc on kirkwood highwayive never been inside i have only ordered ice cream in the drive thru it has been 2 years of going and they have not messed up my order the only issue is that when its busy during the summer if the line is long i wont order a banana split the reason is they make it right away sometimes and its already starting to melt by the time i get it and by the time i get home its already soup i only line 2 miles down the streetreally decent food for a really decent price  i love that they have the sandwiches mostly prepared but undressed  that makes them nice and fresh even when  they are mostly made ahead of time  the food bar salad plus tons of items looked quite good  i almost got it but the sandwich was too good looking to pass up  avocado cant be wrong  i thought charging 1 extra for eggs at lunch is kinda bs since there were tons of people ordering them  i mean extra charges are for abnormal orders or things that they put away but the eggs were none of thatok sushi cool designs and rolls my issue is the price here for 2 people is was 100 and we brought our own wine  we had 6 rolls 2 soups 2 salads you can go to yokohomo or kabuki for half the price for instance there eel roll is like 15 but it should be 68  just a pile of leaves are 7 nothing else is in the salad not much of an atmosphere except the beetles music and pictures probably wont go back just based on the priceswe are always happy to see new businesses move into our neighborhood we have seen long lines at kermits and were hopeful that they represented the quality and selection of a great local bakery unfortunately we have been unable to find things we like at kermits we want some bread other than baguettes and we would love some baked goods without the dairy  the prices for baguettes and baked goods are a little on the steep side  the pizzas look great and there is a nice variety but unfortunately we arent big pizza fans  so please kermits stay in the hood but work on the menu just a little bit if you sold hearty loaves of wheat and rye breads and just one or two vegan cookies id be seeing you just about every nightstopped in here for lunch and walked out uncomfortable with a full belly was only going to get a grilled cheese sandwich but my checkin via yelp gave me a free soup so i went ahead and cashed in on it right there and then got the smokey corn chowder with bacon and while it was quite delicious it was heavy and i probably could have made that my meal by itself but no i continued on and ate all of my baja melt sandwich and washed it all down with a new hope root beer i really wanted one of their shakes but im pretty sure i would have puked as i was utterly stuffed i can only imagine how many calories and fat i took in during that hour which leads me to one gripethey dont publish their nutritional data on their web site personally i get really frustrated when restaurants dont do this there is a little kids seating area with a tv to keep them occupied im surprised that they dont have a macncheese item on their menu all in all though good food with friendly service but if you are watching your weight plan on hitting the gym after eating hereive only gotten to try one of their cupcakes the james bond red velveti tend to judge cupcake places based on their red velvet since everyone has their own version the cupcake flavors are all named after people with j names which i think could get confusing real fast they were at a popup truck event at city hall but i dont know where they usually hang out the cake was definitely moister than some other cupcakes ive had the icing was just ok and the presentation was nothing spectacular but hey its a good cupcake and thats all i needed right then hopefully theyll be back in center city sometime soon so i can try a different flavor and see if i like it betterim usually not one to complain about subway as its always good mainstream stuff  however not sure whats going on with this particular location as well as the one around the corner on plumb which i believe are under the same ownership  for at least the past 9 months its literally been a oneman show behind the counter even at the busiest times during lunch and dinner  while im aware that even the simplest of restaurants are cutting back on labor these days this place just seems nonstop hectic and makes for a really long wait time even if theres only one or two people ahead of you in line  the lone staff member has always been friendly and i gotta admit that this is one of the few locations where i make an extra special effort to leave something in the tip jar  this lone employee is the sandwich artist bread baker dishwasher cashier cookie bagger and order taker all rolled into one although maybe not in that order  ive had much better experiences at the sierra street location downtown which usually has at least 2 people behind the counter making everything run much more efficientlythe food is good but the kids working at this time are not listening to orders i specifically told a asian girl not to put guacamole in my order she did and charged me for it they would not refund itno frills brewery  great for groups  movie screen  speaker system  2x4 jenga  pool table  picnic tables  no foodjust beer  the night we had our party there were food trucksi had high hopes for the braised beef noodle soup but it was just okay  it tasted decent but the portion was small  someone else in my dinner party ordered the zha jiang noodles and it was pretty tasty again the portion was not generous the third person ordered the crispy pork cutlet bento box and was disappointed by both the taste and the portion  it reminded him of hawaiian pork katsu just not as delicious and not as much of it  we also ordered fried calamari and pork rolls as appetizers  those two dishes tasted pretty good  all in all the food was tasty but the prices were a bit too high for the small portionsthe sweet potato fries with jalapeo aioli keep me coming back i always get a bunless burger  each time i eat here i am disappointed the price is so high for an okay burgera pretty decent place if youre just looking for a meal   nothing all that remarkable on the upside but nothing on the downside either   menu food quality and service were all very satisfactory  nice lively atmosphere  sometime you just want a place to eat that wont disappoint you and isnt a chain you know  this place gets that donepeople like the depot and for me its not my kinda of thing so thats why im giving it a 3 start because that is dead middle and the fact it really isnt kid friendly when they say it is bugs me but hey if you want to take your kids to a distillery more power to youhad a really tasty taro bubble tea from tbar  i had never had taro but the barista recommended it  it tastes kind of like cookies and cream  i think they need different cups though  it was spilling all out the sides because they fill it up past the lid and also need bigger straws or smaller bubbles because they kept getting stuck in my straw  the space seems nice definitely a good place to study  ill stop by again if im in the neighborhoodfilipiniana is a middle of the road experience for me ive been there twice now and tried the shaved ice dessert not the giant halo halo the purple ube cake and a couple of the drinks the drinks are pretty average thai tea and iced coffee nothing special the shaved ice was an experience  the first time i had it i had it with the red beans and wasnt crazy about it the second time i nixed the beans and added some extra fruit i was hoping for strawberries but the guy serving me said they needed to be tossed and i ended up with pineapple pieces this one was a bit better but it still isnt my thing now the ube cake is a different story i poached a couple bites from my friend who ordered it it wasnt overly sweet the coconut pieces were great and overall i didnt expect it to be the thing i liked the most this place is at least an hour from me so i wouldnt drive alllll the way for this cake but if i was having lunch nearby or had errands in the area i would totally swing in and order one of the giant pieces   the people working here are super friendly the location is a little hard to find if you dont know what youre looking for and the inside is very clean with lots of bright color if the seating was a bit more comfortable i could see this being a fun place to hang outi had much higher expectations when i went for a visit dont get me wrong the place is very cute staff is friendly and knowledgable item i purchased was tasty but i just thought there would be more of a selection now i did go after 5pm on a weekday so that may have something to do with it i will definitely try them againgood deep dish pie but it wasnt quite there almost but didnt draw full circlegreat pastry and desserts would have rated them 4 stars but didnt like the service the person that took my order needs to stay in the back baking cakes until she learns how to treat customersthis pizzeria was not bad but it was really mediocre and the pizza wasnt remarkable it was st louis style pizza but it really lacked the robust flavor found at most of the st louis pizza places its not bad but if you want st louis style pizza there are other places close by that do a lot betteri dont see what the big problem is honestly i come to this subway quite frequently and usually get my sandwich quickly and at the quality i expect from the subway chain   they lock their doors at 7 but their drivethru stays open beyond that dont expect anything special just a sandwich on the gothis place was right near where i was staying and it had been over a decade since id had a vegan cheesesteak in philly rip giannas so i was really ready to enjoy this sad to say i just didnt like it the sauce tasted strange to me as did the steak which reminded me more of veggie beef noodles in a vegan chinese food dish rather than a  vegan cheesesteak  i couldnt finish more than half and im not known for leaving vegan junk food on a plate obviously different strokes for different folks some people in comments here seem to love it and say its the best in the city and maybe their method of making this is more refined or something but in my opinion it just tasted gross and unappetizing mini desert hubcap was ok some little chocolate peanut butter thing nothing special  the best thing by far was the waterade watermelon lemonadei wish i could rate this place higher   watermelon drink only 135 freshly blended with a bit of ice perfect   edamame salad fresh ingredients but next to no seasoning which made it taste blend server lady asked how it was and was very receptive to the feedback but the other person said to be the manager was not disappointing   purple cloud interesting combo of salmon and chicken tempura loved red and green onions perfect   fire tornado the topping was way too saucy and the whole thing ended up swimming in the sauce it was out of balance and too rich again server lady was appreciative of feedback but the manager was not which is a shame   they are a new local business and we appreciated the clean modern decor but im not sure if id readily want to go back i hope they improve and do wellwe came to this location on mothers day with the impression given to us that it is one of the best ones in the area for many reasons  it did not live up to all the hype we were given  we were seated right away which was great with our group of 10  drinks were promptly brought out and rolls presented  ordering for a group our size has its challenges the first one being that my mil wanted the potato soup that they are known for and apparently on mothers day they were not serving it but they serve it every other day of the year  once that was figured out we all got our orders in and everyone was happy with the loads of sauce that each entree was given one of the hypes we had heard about  everything was eaten up as it arrived hot and ready to eat  the waitress was super nice and did the best she could with the loads of questions and people she had to deal with at our table  everything was boxed up perfectly at the end and she even threw in a box of rollsim updating a previous 1star review  in july 2018 approximately 3 months after my order final gravity shipped my beer kits  i havent had a chance to brew them yet but everything looks good  i cant give 5 stars as the shipment time was excessive and communication was insufficient but they are a honorable business and did take care of my orderhip city veg is on the move  from its original rittenhouse square location it opened up in university city and now has plans for south broad street and washington dc  this is a successful fast food vegan establishment yet it is not my favorite  in an increasingly crowded market of health fastfood dining options in philadelphia hip city veg does some things well and other things not so well  i do like their udon noodle salad but in my mind there is much too much arugula and too little of the other tasty ingredients be they peanuts chicken substitute daikon scallions or even udon itself for the price it would more accurately be named an arugula salad  there are absolutely no condiments out for people to use  aww cmon guys  i did ask and received a little sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit  the sweet potato fries are good but again the portion is small in relation to the price in my opinion there is free water which is nice to have  at the university city location the staff are friendly and its kept cleani havent had a burger from johnny rocket in years but let me tell ya i devoured my rocket burger i had a wonderful waitress named tina she was adorable she made sure we were enjoying everything without being overbearing even though i was exhausted she brightened my day thank youpretty good food but consistently poor service they also do a very bad job with to go orders food orders have been mixed up multiple times and the pho is always placed in a brown paper bag with the bottom soaking from spoilage again good quality food but they need to work on the basicspretty good breakfast there omelets are very good but the service isnt all that great so if you are in a hurry definitely not a great place to golegitimate 35 star breakfast  not to many frills here but you will get some decent eats no doubt  eggs benny corned beef hash and the basic two eggs  ham  hash brown   and toast are all solid choicesi went again this past thursday after dinner at amispnk is usually my favorite place but i was so turned off last night it might be awhile til i head back  three of us were all standing at the bar watching the tv all star game and the bartender just up and turned it to some random channel everyone i was with thought it had to of been a mistake and there was no way that she didnt see us watching  we ended up not saying anything but someone else must have because within 2 minutes she turned it backshe is the only rude bartender in the whole placenothing to write home about  our server was good  the other staff were friendly  the drink was stiff  the food was interesting but not great  the oyster rockefeller special was good but the oyster got a little lost in the sauce  the cheese empendada was cooked perfectly and stuffed full of rich cheese but was paired with a bitter kale salad it needed a sauce to cut the richness  the plantains were cooked well but the relish with which it was served didnt quite work  unfortunately because the small plates were underwhelming i doubt i will give the restaurant a chance to win me over on the entreeshubby and i love living in franklin and while we dont live in westhaven we frequent this neighborhood for the great little chinese place next door  this past weekend we noticed a new neighbor to our stir fry haunt and had to pop in   it seems they only opened two weeks ago and hi brow is a coffee place a pastry place and an ice cream place as well  its a small little shop but the coffee aroma triples its square footage if the front doors are propped open like they were on the night we visited  we enter the front door and see this huge farmhouse type table with this amazing chandelier and glass domed cake stands wire baskets of pastries and random other goodies with comfy benches to prop up a seat  on one side theres a cooler with chilled beverages and at the back there is a small ice cream freezer sporting about eight flavors and a helpful smiling barista  we had just eaten and of course were not hungry at all which means i got ice cream  i picked a buttery caramel traditional cream based something or another flavor and it was yummy  it was rich way rich i could tell ive been on pinkberry for a while now a nice little treat  a plus for some would be that they serve you ice cream in a cup with a wooden spoon felt like a balsa wood or something  im all for saving the planet and i get that plastic is practically forever but i gotta say the sensation of that wooden spoon in your mouth with ice cream not a fan  it was just weird  will we stop back in another day  im sure we will  and ill opt for a cone and probably pick a less rich flavor for my palate but cute nonetheless  the baristaice cream scooper lady said the name hi brow comes from the name of the farm the owners also own  and if youre thinking that huge neon sign is just an hb and not hi brow youd be right  signage isnt big here but in a community like westhaven thats ok  cute place independently owned stop in for a visiti had such high hopes i could find an indian restaurant i could frequent in st pete  it took a long search to finally find 1 in tampa that i now frequently order takeout from i found this  place thru a yelp article ranking the top indian restaurants in pinnellas real disappointed by this place it wasnt bad indian food which i have definitely had before it just wasnt 45 stars or 5 stars good  i ordered the butter chicken and chicken korma medium spice with 2 garlic naans i should have said medium hot because the medium was more mild than spicy for me spiciness would  have helped some with the flavor the spices  in the chicken entrees just tasted muted theyre there but you barely taste it and its not as robust as it should bethe 3 containers 2 regular 1 extra large of rice was a bit overkill for the two small containers of butter chicken and korma we got so pricey for such a small portion of the chicken entree at 15 dollars each the garlic naan 3 dollars each  might as well been regular naan i barely got the taste of garlic im use to tasted so muted yes im comparing it to another place as i always do when trying out the same cuisines my comparison is to indias grill located in tampa off kennedy the butter chicken was the better of the two dishes but just average the korma says its made with cashew paste but just tasted like yellow curry i got no hint of the cashew nuttiness for both dishes it just tasted like the curry and spices flavor needed perhaps more time to  build and marinate  the rice was bland yes sure its white  basamati rice which is a fragrant rice in itself but im use to the plain basmati white rice being fragrant from additional whole spices of bay leaves cinnamon stick n coriander seeds that elevates the natural fragrance i thought maybe the flavors would soak in a lil more taste more flavorful the next day but sad to report still the sameafter a good night of pinball and drinks down the street i decided to take a friend from the uk to strange to check out the hype  we each had a maple bacon and gooey butter  both were good but not quite up to the hype  the vibe was cool staff fun and the donuts were fine just not what i consider great  will give it another shot before final judgementi went here on a saturday night with high expectations but was kind of disappointed  things started out well the hostess told us it would be an hour wait but we got a table within half an hour  unfortunately it went downhill from there    we ordered the mussels with white wine and lemon when it arrived after a long wait the sauce was delicious but the mussels themselves were a little dried out like they had been sitting for a while   after another looong interval our entrees finally arrived  my medium rare burger was medium well at best which was a huge disappointment particularly at this place which seemed like theyd take pride in their burgers  there was some red juice on the plate so maybe it was initially medium rare and just sat under the warmer for too long the fries and pickle were yummy as were my friends pulled pork sandwich and fish and chips with mashie peas    when i asked the server where my side of brussels sprouts was he replied oh the sides have all been coming out way after the entrees  um  if you realize thats happening maybe someone should fix it  when they arrived halfway through the meal they were delicious and steaming hot  he also never brought me the side of mayo i asked for to go on my burger   so in retrospect maybe all the problems could be explained by poor service  or poor time management in the kitchen  either way it wasnt everything i hoped itd be there are plenty of other better gastropubs in the citygreat kastle burgers great donuts  but sadly bad service  food is great tho depending on what you getwe had an early dinner at hellas the place was just getting ramped up for dinner around 6pm we got a table nestled back in the corner which was fine  lamb riblets for an appetizer not much to them but the flavor was real good we both had a small greek salad with our meal the dressing was terrific and the salad was fresh i had the greek shrimps for my meal   sauteed in red onion sauce butter with feta  very good my sweetheart had the dolmades they were very good as well our waiter was a little slow clearing the table of dirty dishes but we made do the place was clean and the bakery is amazing we both ordered a dessert that finished the meal perfectly i would come back here and eat again to try some of the other items on the menuwas super excited to take my husband here for lunch  but what a disappointment the ambiance decor and service were as good as last time but the food  needed some work  i had seen all the amazing photos of the grilled cheese so i had to have it mine didnt look like the pictures though the ratio of bread to filler wasnt great and the tomatoes had the hard cores you cant really eat the soup had a skin on top and was really gelatinous the sammie and the soup were both luke warm husbands meal the dip was about the same  it was a sad sad day ill give it one more go because i was so impressed by my first visit  fingers crossed this was a flukethis is a good solid spot for burgers and fries theyre usually pretty busy but its usually worth the wait service is usually pretty fast and the food is good i would probably recommend this to a friendso went here after reading good reviews expecting something great but got something mediocre  location is great but it is very tiny no tables inside just bar seating and only 4 tables outside on pier food was ok but nothing to write home about and ive had better at red lobster  waiter was nice and attentive and was pretty reasonably pricedwe got there late in the day and only 2 lb crabs were left so we opted for other menu items instead i got lobster pasta very little lobster was evident and my wife got crab cakes mostly filler and seasonings we also had shrimp bisque very little shrimp taste  the food was not bad but not great either  very middle of the road thus 3 stars  i think if youre not going to get the locally caught crab youd be better off dining somewhere elsedespite the wait and the blasting ac there is something appealing about the pancake pantry  the waitresses are very nononsense and are good about keeping your coffee cup filled the service is amazingly quick considering the size and popularity of the pantry and getting to choose from all those crazy styles of pancakes is kind of fun  i also like the dineroldtimey feel of the restaurant  the peach pancakes were too syrupy and sweet for me but the buttermilk pancakes are pretty tasty  the portions are huge so go hungry or choose a couple of items a la carte     however  the pantry isnt the kind of place i would patronize regularly  since its such a nashville establishment it would be a good place to take the relatives from out of town  but when i think about the lines the noise and the prices at  the pantry id much rather just make my own pancakes or go get some real coffee and a bagel at sam and zoesalthough h  w produce can be a bit of a drive for nonmilwoods residents to come here they have a great selection of vegetables at such a cheap price  no kidding  the only drawback is you need to come at the right time of the week  ive made the mistake of coming here a couple of times on a midweek evening and havent found a lot of fresh vegetables  they really up the ante for the weekend rush so thats the best time to go  on quite a few occasions now ive come here and bought like two heavy bags of veggies and fruits and spent under 20 for it  granted stuff like watermelon cauliflower etc weigh a lot and dont cost that much  but you get the point  now when it comes to selection  im amazed  as much as i adhere to being a locavore off late i find that h  w carries some really unique vegetables and fruits that often times almost exclusively grow in parts of asia  ive ended up going off the wagon a couple of times when ive had the dire need for some okra  i think on one occasion i noticed 5 different kinds of aubergines   isnt that weird shit  yes  also maybe 56 different kinds of spicy peppers  need i say more  definitely a unique experience buying groceries here  definitely very affordable and even cheaper than superstore  a bit of a drive and given my new fondness for locally grown stuff i may not be coming here that oftenmy son and i have come here a few times as we waited for his chess lesson  its a mcdonalds  it is trying to be trendier mcdonalds  flowers on the table cafe style etc  one visit my son shared a magic trick  the lady was impressed and gave him a cookie  that was nice  its comfortable enough and things seem clean enough  in the end its a mcdonaldswe were shoved in a tiny corner in the back room next to a huge party of pre teen girls i walked out with a huge migraine due the manager and waitresses inability to tell the children to stop screamingrunning around and playing in the fireplace this is not chuck e cheese  food was ok nothing special had to send mine back specifically asked for no bacon and entree came covered  had to ask twice for silverware and napkinsmy girlfriend had high hopes for this place me on the other hand i have had the best barbecue in the city so i had my doubts  it sucks when the best thing on your menu is tacos  you wouldnt think a barbecue place would be telling the customers try the tacos  theyre awesome while they are great youd expect more  we each got an order of ribs  my ribs were pretty good fall of the bone juicy very good  her ribs on the other hand were tough had a very porky almost hot dog like taste she didnt like them at all  mac and cheese was pretty solida decent safeway with friendly butchers it can get overcrowded easily as many things as jammed together they can probably handle that better but no major complaints about the service herei was a wee tot and lived in indy back when president ford was in office and i remember going downtown with my dad to shapiros  fast forward 30 years to now and i made a trip to shapiros carmel outpost which someone at the hotel i stayed at told me was similar to their downtown location  wellhm  maybe i was on my nostalgia tour of indy just a little too much  i wasnt ready for cafeteria doityourself service at sitdown restaurant prices  a sandwich drink and some rather forgetful side dish of potato salad came to almost 20not the 12 i thought it was all truly worth  the sandwich was exactly as orderedrye and corned beef and nothing else  excellent  butthe sticker shock still wore on me for a while  and whats with the cashier calling me baby every two seconds  she did it to everyone moving through the checkout line  i walk up to her she said how you doing baby  i asked her if the soda is refillableno baby  i hand her the money she said thank you baby  pause  heres your change baby  i said my thanks  and here it comes youre welcome baby  napkins over therebaby  the last time i actually ate at a shapiros i practically was a real babyahh i wanted to like this place italian food is my absolute fave honestly its only getting three stars bc it was a cute little place with some nice people the only thing was it was sort of hot inside well on to the bad stuff the food is really bland like little to no taste  i was so disappointed and supper upset that we had to pay so much for food we cared nothing for but we arent the type to complain to get a discount or free food i got the alfredo and added chicken 15 it came with a salad which i got ranch and their ranch tasted like you barely had some left in the bottle and you took water and shook it up and poured in on my lettuce and i say salad bc it seriously was just lettuce with some round olives on one side like 3 and some fine chopped tomatoes my husband got the lasagna 15 and a salad with ranch the lasagna tasted like something from a chef boy r d can all of which was edible but they are not worth the money or even another try for maybe other items off the menu my son got a cheese pizza 7 and surprisingly it was the best thing there after all its hard to mess up a cheese pizza like their bread they bring out to the table was bland all that and three drinks well actually two bc one was a water came to a total of 45 before tip yes we still tipped bc like i said the people was nice its just the food was horrible    they do have like 3 pokemon go stops that you can use while your forcefully eating your bland dinner lol people set off lures over there like crazy as well i love panera but today i was really disappointed i ordered the chicken salad with almonds what i got was a tomato lettuce and maybe a tablespoon of chicken salad it did not even cover the bread i also ordered a salad but i have not eaten it yet i usually order the turkey bacon and avocado sandwich which is so good i will tell you to go to arbys if you want a really good chicken salad sandwich the filling falls out of the bread they use pecans instead of almonds which i dont think i even found one in this sandwich i will go back but i will never order this sandwich againive had these donuts 3 or 4 times they are ok some like the maple bacon were downright amazing the first time i tried them since then though i feel the quality and craftsmanship has gone downhill   the maple bacon for example had super crispy bacon and lots of it when i first had it the last time i had one there was maybe 14 slice of bacon crumbled on top and it was really soggy and very sloppily put together like it had rolled down a hill and landed frostingsidedown   i do feel its worth a try for the novelty of it because the flavors they come up with are indeed strange and really interesting i heard they recently had a surge donut and im kinda sad i missed that one  also 2donut what the what that sh is bananas even if its for a banana foster donutthis place has a lot of hype  but in my opinion it is overrated the marketdeli was extremely crowded and mazzaros is pretty small and narrow in areas to maneuver through it became a maze to stay clear of the crowds i have learned that it is not a place to bring small kids the sandwiches we ate there were sesame tuna pretty good but soggy bronze fish tasty but soggy and over sauced and meatball sub horrible mess and meatballs were too dense the market part has some unique offerings but i can find most in speciality shops that are less crowded or online i also brought home cookies from the bakery which were pretty good but we were not blown awaysolid place  good selection and well stocked shelves  while it is expensive it has a good selection of items  they have both high end and gourmet items  they also offer boars head cheese and meatsservice was great food was just okay came here for dinner with a friend using a groupon that included one starter two sandwichesburgers and one dessert   guacamole  you could definitely tell that it was made fresh to order as they claim on the menu but it was so bland there were barely any red onions cilantro or jalapeno in it and it looked and tasted like mashed up avocados  cowboy burger  this was pretty good the brioche bun was toasted nicely and didnt get soggy the patty was thick and cooked medium which is what i asked for even though it had melted cheese barbecue sauce bacon and an onion ring it didnt feel overly greasy it came with fries which there were a ton of i didnt finish it because i wanted to leave room for dessert   milehigh apple pie  this is ginormous it was served warm with vanilla ice cream crust was nice overall it was yummy but after a while i got tired of eating all those apples so i think i prefer a regular notmilehigh apple pie   even though they have more than just ice cream ha thats probably the only thing id come back forthese donuts are on trend in that they are large yeasty and feature funky flavor combinations unfortunately i found the donut to be very dry i have made it a mission to try the best donuts wherever i travel  this does in fact seem to be the best spot in new orleans  but they just didnt stack up to what ive had in dc new york or chicago i do think this place must have really good food outside of the donuts  it smelled very good the staff was also very friendly  one thing that was also a turn off was that they offered a passion and cocoa nib donut  this is a flavor combo that dough in nyc is famous for i really hope these people didnt blatantly copy them seems a little too obviousi stopped by this place after i got a massage next door  i heard it just opened and figured why not try it out  the food tastes decent but the portions are rather small so to have a meal you really need the medium and large meals  one of the medium meals i had was just under 8 and the other large was just under 13    personally at that price for the large i would rather go to ciccio cali and get myself a hot and spicy tuna bowel with spaghetti squash or kale  the snacks and desserts were okay tasting and i could see if you had a sweet tooth these may be healthier options   i think if you do not cook at all and dont know how to find held thy meals eating out this may be a good option every now and again  but spending almost 900 upfront for 1000 in meals as a member doesnt seem like a good option   as someone who cooks i know i can make similar health meals for 14 of the price since fresh groceries from publix runs me about 60 per week  bottom line not a good value for the moneyif you can make it there do it great produce selection the strawberries are like candy however it really sticks in my craw that they dont allow dogs my dog is super well behaved and we came on vacation with our pet we had to turn around as soon as we got there because of the no dog rule they are losing customers that way if we didnt come with a big group who could watch the dog they would have lost our businessyes the ice cream is good and this place is rapidly becoming a new orleans institution however ya its good but i dont find it extra ordinary or overly exceptional i dont know maybe i should try the house specialty or something and maybe my opinion would change oh and fyi  they only except cashthis seems like a typical indian grocery store  definitely has a good selection of items one would find in say nj or near philly so major kudos to them i had to take one star off because sign on the door says they take amex yet their counters are not equipped with that capability  major unforeseen inconvenience although out of the way from any major highways this i maybe the closest indian grocery store to the berks county area with any lack of competition the price is expected to be higher than one would find in the norristown area not a big deal hopefully they will be around for many years to comeburger and fries were good our server was flaky and the atmosphere was cozy  the best part about the entire visit was the house made black cherry cream soda and the nostalgic pictures of indianapolis on the walli just cant give besito more than 3 stars knowing i can head over to acapulco grocery store or taqueria emanuel and get better tacos for half the price   sure if you took your date to a mexican grocery store youd probably go home alone that night but if your date is a true foodie then the way to a womans heart is through her stomach plus she will be blown away by your ballsiness of taking her out to a notsofancybutawesomefood place rather than trying to impress her with nice decorambiance  summary mediocre food high price nice decor good servicewe ordered 12 pcs angel wings and fried pickleswe got the food and server just disappearand theres only 2 tables on a tuesday  i would suggest next time msserver to double check your table first before chitchating to the bar tender for 10mins we will come back again hoping to get a diff serverthe beer is good but not very unique the menu is good i had the turkey club sandwhich which was really  good the thyme mayo was delicious to get a good taste of their beer get the sampler which has 6 different  flavors of small beers for 10   my reason for giving them a 3 is the snotty attitudes of their staff our waiter was alright but didnt  do anything  above and beyond when we went to leave we visited the gift shop where a lot of items were missing  prices the hostess was less than thrilled to answer questions and when we checked out the two ladies were too involved in their own conversation to offer any pleasantries it was very rude and tainted our whole experiencewe had just an okay time not sure if it was the small group or the long stories seems the intention was to go to restaurants to have us order a drink and pay extra im sure the participating restaurants would appreciate this i thought the tour was going to be focused on the history and types of food not necessarily about the history of the restaurants also seeing a mouse in the napoleon restaurant was a big turn off i get the buildings are old but no excuse to have rodents in the dining room yuck preston was nice knowledgeable and very familiar with the area food was good and portions were large for a tasting  i think the pace of the tour can pick up it was very slowo my buns is new franchise that opened up near the food court in park place mall  they give away free samples and their store reminded me of those little korean bakeries you find in some cities  their flyers on the mall entrance doors states that these are fresh buns  it is not like they are reinventing cinnabons but these are just pastry sweet breads rolled out with different flavors  they are a good combination with coffees and teas  there are plenty of coffee drinks at o my buns and the buns have hints of tiramisutasting powder in them  they are fairly sweet and spongy  i think they were 175 eachmy husband and i visited simpson house tea room because we purchased a deal through living social we had never been to simpson before so we thought the living social deal offered a great opportunity to check it out we visited on a day when there was some rough icy winter weather the tea house is absolutely adorable and food and presentation is impressive the amount of food you get with the living social deal was also impressive for the price based on ambiance and quality of food i would give the tea house a solid 4 stars the thing that wasnt pleasant about the experience was the service and the attitude of the server that daywhom told me at checkout she was the owner from the moment we walked in the server was very short and not very inviting i attempted to make small talk about the weather and her response showed that she was not happy to be there that day even at checkout on the way out she was cold and short with her commentsalmost argumentative at times i even complimented the food to which i received a response of  weve been doing this for 13 years it better be right a simple thank you would have been a nice response there was only one other table with people at it when we arrived so not a busy daymost likely because of the poor weather conditions i learned the hard way that there were no substitutions with tea sandwiches when using a living social deal when i asked that a certain sandwich be omitted and another sandwich be put in its place or just leave the 2 sandwiches out completely as to avoid waste i was  unpleasantly told that the sandwiches are already made up and there are no substitutions then i heard an elderly woman whom appeared to be another employee there dining with friends at the other table yell across the room we can double up today on the sandwiches its no problemwe didnt make anything of it really as we didnt really know who the woman was that made the comment i saw the elderly woman get up and go into the kitchen and then realized she was either an owner or employee this part is what bothered us most i heard our server yell at the elderly woman from the kitchen you shut your mouth my guess is that the nice elderly lady addressed our tea sandwich request to the server we heard her clear as day in the dining area it seemed the elderly woman was more interested in making our first experience more pleasant than our server was seeing that this was our first visit to the tea house we would think that it would be important to make a good impression and provide friendly service so that the visiting guest returns i get that the weather was miserable and that people have bad days perhaps we caught our server on a bad day it just left us feeling very unwelcome and we are not wanting to return to the tea house good friendly service plays a huge part in dining experiencesnot just great food and ambiance i also was surprised that at the end of our experience we were handed a card with a breakdown of taxes we were responsible for  and a suggested gratuity amount in all the times ive ever used a living socialgroupon voucher at a restaurant we never received something like this in other cases the paid voucher covers all food and taxesand then we always leave gratuity on the original cost of the food the card reminder and breakdown in a check folio was a little bit tacky in my opinion before visiting the tea house i thought that if we were pleased with our experience that we would return with some out of town guests that will be visiting in a few weeks after the dining experience we decided we will be taking our guests to a different tea housesigh  my kingdom for an experience that doesnt degrade over time like a bad drug habit  i have gotten burned out with my normal venues and in a frantic mental search for where i hadnt been that was relatively close and might be ok i remembered amelia greys  i keep passing by at times when its closed or for some reason cant go and then i forget about it when im goingin any case id been meaning to go and hadnt  the native cafe used to be a favorite and that location has since had trouble keeping an anchor   when i arrived on this weekday morning it was no longer ags but prep  pastry  therefore part of the imagery which had drawn me  ie bakery case and cafe feel  was gone  instead it was a nicely appointed restaurant in the ubiquitous chunks of wood and lofty ceiling all the places in tucson now must do  maybe you cant even get a buildout permit in tucson if you dont use that aesthetic its that pervasive  the first thing i noticed was that the hostess stand is in the wrong place  it needs to be further to the left so that a table or two can be put in front of the fire place without congesting the entry  now that space looks oddly empty and the flow through is wrong  the second thing i noticed is that this place is heavy on the young men  a woman may likely greet you and cook but most of the servers ive seen are men  thats interesting and definitely creates a vibe which im not sure if i like or dont    the first day i was delighted to see that breakfast in some form can be had in the afternoons  as we know breakfast is best had at any time of day and should be always on offer but rarely is  i had the simple breakfast which was indeed simple but for a restaurant of a certain genre not badly priced at 6  except you know they scrimp on the toastartisan toast  eye roll  my biggest complaints were that the eggs were heavy on the salt the bread was too hard and the bacon too soft  the coffee was very good even if my server was too busy talking football and whatnot to refill it timely  i did feel that i would be getting better service if i was cuter which is not what you want  all in all though my experience was good and i was sure to come back  so i did  sadly it was a downhill experience  this time i made sure to come in the hours of a full breakfast menu only to find that it wasnt appreciably more varied  i ordered the omelette after the waiter had fawned on its inclusion of steak 5yr cheddar mushrooms tomatoes  yum  it arrived again oversalted and without a trace of steak  my toast also arrived hard and completely dry with no butter or jam  sigh  coffee was still good  but heres what kinda altered my good feelings  hey you know theyre new and im well willing to let some bugs get worked out while everyone is figuring out what works tweaking is inevitable so when i pointed out the lack of a major ingredient in my dish i wasnt mad  just you know fix it  however the answer i got was that the waiter had made a mistake and read the beefsteak tomatoes as steak and tomatoes  ok again these amusing foibles take place  and  and nothing  though i would not have ordered the dish as it was and although the waiter was clearly in error no one seemed to feel that warranted any attention  not a comped danish or coffee or jack  so what had been a good time by all was now a source of irritation at dumb customer service which if i am being frank about my bias i think may relate to having so many boys in the house  theres so often just alack of social finesse and empathic awareness when boys are in charge tony  makerhouse is a huge exception to this generality  it all reminded me of the book 5 apology languages  i am most decidedly in the accepting responsibility and restitution camps  i am not interested in your flowery debasement nor is mere acknowledgment enough  i want to know how youre going to make it right  because otherwise an apology without making it right just tells me that youre paying lip service and really dont give a shit if im happy    so yes ill probably go back for limited wants but it is unlikely to be my goto  and guys  cut it out with the salt for christ sakego for the beer its some of the best ive ever hadbedotter being the stand out the food is good but its essentially upscale bar food service tends to be slow when theyre busy that said great beer decent food worth a look make reservations on weekends and be prepared to scramble for parkingbaked goods are delicious especially jam with custard croissant   flan was a bit heavy  chicken tamales tasted so good but kinda dry not the best chili relleno but was ok  cheapwent for happy hour for the second time most recently our first visit the food was very good but our second visit was terrible so mixed results although the happier menu and prices are not bad at allstarted a saturday morning excited to try some strange donuts walked in to a such an upbeat fun place music was playing staff was friendly and they were giving out free birthday donuts i really liked the fun atmosphere   we ordered a campfire maple bacon jelly and gooey butter my favorite was the campfire cake donuts are not usually my favorite but these were the best out of the ones we ordered the dough tasted different than your typical cake donut a bit lighter and drier and paired well with coffee  the maple bacon topping and icing were great but i didnt like the glazed type dough at all on this one the topping is what made the  maple bacon edible if it was just glazed i wouldnt have eaten more than a few bites my husband felt the same about the jelly donut dry bland almost inedible dough  i really enjoyed the atmosphere friendly service and creative toppings i really wanted to love the donuts but thought they were just okay if i happen to be in the area again one morning i might stop in for another cake donut but probably wont go out of my way to come hereim going to give them 3 stars because i understand the growing pains they are experiencing  the food isnt bad and they try very hard with an inexperienced waiting staff management can turn this aroundfirst time we had eaten at the new location  the building and decor are a great improvement and are nice and modern  it was busy on a saturday night but we were seated quickly  mostly families including people of all ages  the cute waitress was attentive and pleasant  service was reasonably quick given that they were full  overall the food was hohum  the minestrone soup was very good and my wife liked her salad   the main coursesnot so much  the ravioli was pasty possibly undercooked and the sauce was mediocre  her spaghetti was ok but she was not excited about it  rolls were a bit dry and boring  there was plenty of it  the menu is pages long and there is a lot of variety available  they would probably be better off of they focused on making a shorter list of choices taste better  we know better italian restaurants but this one is close to home  if we come back that will be the reasonmy husband and i are in nashville searching for dog friendly establishments amidst the 40 degree weather this place has a perfect patio with heaters to keep you warm which allows dogs to come hang  i wont lie i was skeptical to come here from the pictures on yelp i was pretty disinterested but with our dog the options were limited  we arrive and was promptly greeted by first our waiter and then our real waitress she was very smiley and kind and pretty but i will say as our time went on it declined just a little  the staff was more than willing to provide a few tasters before we chose our beers the first waiter filled our dogs water bowl with tons of water   i would probably come back if i lived in nashville but as a tourist i think there are better options the two things that made this have to be a 3star review were as follows  1 the potato chips that come with the sandwiches are lays please please make some house made chips they always rock when you do  2 smoking is allowed on the patio well duh its a patio yeah but when the patio is basically a room because of the liners that go around any smoke is going to remain and travel over to you cough coughi would say that this place has the right idea but the execution is a bit off  i love the idea of a good burger place that focuses on good quality ingredients i would say that bareburger has that right however the burgers are nothing special and mine was a bit overcooked i get mine medium and it was a little over additionally i would say it was a bit bland  the beer selection was just ok and the prices were a bit steep  i would say that the atmosphere was a bit off as well kinda empty weird decor music that seemed a bit too quiet and slow for a burger joint  i would give bareburger another chance if the prices came down a bit or the burger got a bit bigger or the beer menu expanded for now i will wait and have my burgers elsewherei had been on a quest for this elusive falafel truck for many months the exotic locale and precious few hours open make it quite difficult for me to reach but i had read so much about this enigmatic vehicle that i waited patiently for a chance to escape the laboratory for the express purpose of discovering this fabled cuisine   during my first attempt i arrived at 115 which is not such an unreasonable hour of the afternoon there were approximately 5 falafel seekers ahead of me but alas i was told he would not be serving any more customers that day bollocks my plans were foiled and the mythical falafel had evaded me   i anxiously awaited another opportunity to seek this supposed holy grail of middle eastern food the second time i arrived at 1130 and was forced to wait interminably but wait i did suffering through fathomless prattle from the proprietor to which i politely smiled and nodded in response finally my toils and currency were justly rewarded with a heavy platter of delicioussmelling sustenance    end dramatization    it was a lot of food but also kind of expensive at 10 a platter as the guy said you could pay a lot more at a restaurant for food like that true but this is a food truck and not a restaurant the chicken and rice truck in new york is about half the price and twice the deliciousness   most of it tasted good even really good but nothing was particularly outstanding except for maybe the grapeandotherunidentifiablethingssalad which was very interesting in flavor everything else was a little too garlicky even for my taste and im the kind of person who could snort garlic powder also the chicken and falafel were both too burnt and i generally like a little charred flavor   it may be worth noting that my friend politely asked several times if it would be possible to bring another platter back for someone else he began to babble about a liquor license and something about drinks im not sure if he legitimately doesnt have a firm grasp of the english language or if he was consciously choosing to ignore her question by rudely changing the subject and feigning incomprehension   was it good sure was it worth all that time effort and money on my part maybe not still the falafel nazi is worth trying at least once as long as its not too out of the way for youthis is a great place to go to find unusual food items  the staff is amazing and courteous  they have a sample station in the back  they can get quite busy i recommend going during the week  pricing isnt always cheap but i wouldnt say it is expensive  they have little mini carts for the kids  i really like their selection of fresh flowers  really like tjsill agree with other reviewers this place really needs to be remodeled or use their drivethrough service and they were prompt courteous and quick and the food is good so kudos for that but lets address the place up a little things would be much more enjoyableweve been wanting to try kanellas brunch for about a year now and given that we needed to be in the area we decided to try it out we stopped in without reservations around 1pm and when my bf told the server we didnt have a reservation but it was his birthday they did their best to accommodate us luckily one of the tables didnt show up for their reservation so we got to stay our server was awesome so eager to help and make recommendations and super friendly we decided on the watercress salad and cuttlefish both of which were specials we also got the lamb sausage and duck egg breakfast the food was good but we werent overly impressed by anything we really enjoyed the lamb sausage dish but felt that it was a bit small the salad was good but nothing special i felt that the flavor of parsley somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish but i also dont really like parsley so i may have been particularly sensitive given the incredible reviews im wondering if we just didnt order all that well especially because we love meditarranean food the service was excellentthe server put a candle in our order of baklava without our even asking i would definitely go back and try it againi tried the korean bbq taco i had really high expectations for this taco only because ive had these tacos before in los angeles from a food truck called kogi i ordered 1 just incase i didnt like it well it was no where near as good as the ones from la the meat was cut in really big chunks and it was super fatty im not kidding when i say this every piece of meat in the taco was pure fat i also tried the southern fried chicken taco now that taco was pretty damn good i also tried the beans and rice cant really mess up on beans the rice on the other hand had its own twist it was a very very good twist haha my wife had a blended margarita that was probably the best ive had in tennessee and trust me ive tried a lot of them the establishment itself was super clean and modern i really like the bar top they had all in all good food and a great videreally fancy breakfast food thats all it really is eggs and bacon can only be made so nice the real gem is their bakery right next door they are not even separated by a wall they have dozens of types of baked goods from cookies to cakes those are worth buying in dozensi am not a big fried fish fan so going here so we ended up here only because its obligatory when you are in clearwater the decor is fun kind reminded me of joes crab shake and we had a great server she was extremely attentive and friendly i point this out because we tried to go here last night for dinner but the hostess at the podium was rude and wouldnt provide an answer when we asked her how long the wait would be for a table we ended up elsewhere that said the food this afternoon was a ok we had the crab dip which was pretty delicious and i had the mahi mahi tacos they were just ok nothing to write home about but good enough for the price i also thought the fries were pretty tasty i finished off my meal with the peanut butter pie which i recommend highly it was clearly a frozen variety that was premade but still very tasty a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon when you cant be on the beachjackpot  777 777 777 yelp review 777 for me everyone playing the slots would love to see lucky 777 for big money  while i was in tampa i decided to check out the seminole hard rock casino the new south parking garage had just opened when i was here i didnt stay at the hotel so this review is based on the casino  oh man the floor was very busy and mobbed with a sea of old folks with most slot machines in this big casino being played i felt very young like i was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center i think to myself as a current working class taxpayer i really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their social security and medicare checks sigh  the casino also has poker tables texas hold em tournaments bars nightclub restaurants food court and the hard rock retail store i saw the food here was on the pricey side and its good that i ate lunch before stopping here i did some shopping at the retail store and picked up some cool hard rock pins and tshirts this store does not accept the hard rock cafe all access card points program but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card   overall its not vegas but its a decent place to play the slots in the tampa bay area with very easy highway access tofrom i4the menu is 95 vietnamese but they do have thai and korean dishes too i got the seasons special banh mi sandwich and a strawberrybanana boba tea the bread was what made the sandwich awesome nice and warm crispy outside and soft inside it was well done all of the ingredients tasted fresh and was piled in it was smaller than normal but well worth the 350 i was tempted to get another the boba tea was nothing special   the young bubbly cashier had a difficult time explaining what the special was and the kitchen needs to work on timing i got my sandwich and finished it long before my drink came out i also watched two girls walk out with nine yes nine drinks and they ordered them after me   the place is small with a handful of tables some with a random chairs that seems out of place but the decor is fun and inviting they also have a pastry case with dessert items like cupcakes truffles and assorted cakes and sweets in addition they have a variety of prepackaged asian candy and cookies with hello kitty items if you enjoy tea they have a great selection of teas including oolong and custom made teas for saleif im in old city not olde city and need a vitamin water or whatever ill come here otherwise its just another expensive bodega to methis location is very hit or mess  there has been a few times that there has been very little cream cheese on my bagel with extra cream cheese there has been more than a few times that i have ordered a vanilla latte and i could not taste any vanilla   however the employees are nice enough and remember your order if you get it frequentlyi liked the blueberry scone but a little disappointed in the cookies and cream donut their food is better i had the french toast which had some amazingly fresh jam eggs and bacon was standardok if sylvias can fix a few things they have potential to be a 4 at most i am being nice and understanding that they are new so i gave them a 3 instead of a 2 they have been advertising the opening of sylvias for a while now so my aunt who hosts family nights every 3rd saturday suggested that we all go here and enjoy dinner instead of the usual potluck  i was the first one to arrive and the building on the outside looked very nice and the inside did as well there is a large takeout area near the parking lot and when i first walked in the main area i thought wowthis reminds me of a place i would go to back home in atlanta nice decor contemporary and designed well  the hostess seemed a little off and wasnt quick to greet me so i went up to her she was pretty prompt with everyone else but for some reason when i was waiting there she was acting reallybusy for a long time looking for a piece of paper and pen being the assertive person i am at times i addressed thatmoving on  while i was waiting on my family members to arrive i sat at the bar and watched the rest of the fsu homecoming game while sipping on some moscato not all restaurants and bars carry moscato but they know how we are and that we love our moscato lol they had 3 different moscato options tooa glass was 600  my family finally arrived and we were seated in the very backparty of 11 nowlet me start off by saying that the people in my family have very strong personalities lol so i had a hard time telling if the service was really that bad or if they were just acting extra like they can at times it did take a while to get the drink order in and the server was called back to the kitchen like 3 times while were trying to place our order because everything was so unorganized  after waiting for our food for a good 45 minutes my aunt couldnt take it anymore she got up and went to the owner and back to the kitchen demanding our food or that we would leave i held my head down and just laughed because i already knew that this night was going to turn into an episode better than any reality tv show out right now the owner came back to apologize and said he would have our food out in 5 minutes and then he ran back to the kitchen you know what he had all our food out in 5 minutes i was thanking god at that point because i knew at 6 minutes my hungry crazy family was going to turn that restaurant upside down  ok so finally the good and bad according to me and all my now satisfied family 1mac and cheese 5 stars delicous 2fried chicken 4 stars pretty darn good 3greens they ran outhow you run out of greens at a soul food restaurant 4chitlins  yuck my uncle said they were 5 stars good 5potato salad 1 star taste tooooo sweet sent them back for sweet potato fries 6sweet potato fries 1 star no flavor greasy and soggysent them back and ordered a second mac and cheese 7chicken and waffles 4 stars good 8mash potatoes 3 stars came out cold the first time 9cornbread2 stars my families is better they were cold the first time asked for another basket 10 smothered porkchops fried 4 stars good 11 kids meals were big my little cousin said his grilled ham was good 4 stars  everything was pretty much hit or miss and because its new there were a lot of sides they were out of and not so great service major confusion i am used to great cooking and good soul food in my family so its going to take a lot to impress methe desserts didnt impress me either the owner and manager  who needs a sweat towel lol did try his best to keep us all seated and happy  and i really appreciate them being patient with my family lol i will come back in 3 months or so and give an updatefunniest thing  i went here expecting a notsogreat meal why would i go somewhere expecting subpar food  i dont really have an answer for that just wanted to try it i guess  and hey im glad i did  everything there is clearly homemade everything was really pretty damn solid    they had goat which was the first time i had ever eaten goat  and it was really tender and tastey    despite it being the last half hour of their lunch buffet everything was still pretty fresh    i will say i do still prefer new delhi which is right around the corner and the same damn price but this place is a really solid alternative choiceunless youre really into pancakes you can skip this restaurant only being an ok fan of pancakes i still went because one of my friends loves pancakes and because the line was out the door down the block and around the corner i figured it must be good with that kind of wait  all i can say is eh i wasnt blown away   we ordered the sweet potato pancakes for the table to try which were actually really really good and literally melted in your mouth but besides that i was not impressed with anything else on the menu i ordered an omlette that came with a side of buttermilk pancakes the omlette was ok really nothing special the buttermilk pancakes were definitely good but wasnt jaw dropping stop talking because im stuffing my face good my friends ordered different varitation of pancakes and i guess maybe i was expecting too much ie they might use different batter for their fruit pancakes or something but they dont its just the buttermilk with fruit dropped in it or on top   i will say though that their cinnomon syrup was heaven if you go you have to use it its really wonderful if they dont do this already they should bottle it and sell it because its that good they also warmed all the syrup which i thought was a nice touch the hash browns are also worth getting i thought it was pretty good   service was ok but expected at a place like this we sat by the kitchen and noticed there was a back log of food sitting on the counter the servers couldnt get it out fast enough   things to avoid on the menu the parisienne i think people at this place have a different definition of thin because these were definitely not crepe like it looked like they took regular pancakes and rolled it up the fresh squeezed oj that was 7 and definitely did not taste fresh squeezed is definitely worth avoiding too  if i ever make my way back to nashville i think the only way id come back is if i didnt have to wait in like for an hourwent here for brunch on saturday afternoon the menu was kind of small and had more lunch choices rather than breakfast where i like an even proportion of both i ordered the breakfast americana which was good but nothing extraordinary but i mean i guess it is kind of hard to make eggs and bacon fabulous their fries were delicious though i must say i wanted to try the windsor burger but refrained as i was in a breakfast mood i hear it is quite delicious and i guess i will have to go back and seei like remedy  havent tried too much of the food but have had the wraps and am waiting to still try the dosas  given that i my roots are from the south of india i must say that i tend to have very high expectations for the dosa clan of food items which is quite different from north indian food naans etc  now what i have tried i really ilke  they make an awesome himalayan chai which is green in color  strongly infused with crushed pistachios extremely flavorful and filling  its caffeine free too  its really more like flavored milk   i also like some of the other things out there  they have a large variety of tea bags that you can pick up for your hot tea  remedy has some seriously filling muffins etc to go with teacoffee for those just looking for the cafe experience  mostly whole grain muffins with high fiber and filling as hell its great for an afternoon break from work kind of thing  i like em  the food looks very good to be honest  i cant wait to try some of the things  dosa is one but even some of the more traditional north indian varieties look pretty good  another review will appear once ive tried the foodwe love the food here but theyve recently changed how they provide service we ordered takeout just three tacos and some queso it took us 35 minutes to receive our food  this is unacceptable and disappointing  we will give them a few more chances but if this continues we will find our taco fix elsewheregood oysters on the half shell bad seating control there were open seats inside that they were not using   just letting people stand around and wait the inside of the restaurant smelled like a dive bar we ended up just ordering at the to go window on the side of the place and eating at a picnic table on the pier people were leaving that were on the wait list because it took too long to get seated the people managing the seating list were not very helpful and had an attitudea bit oldfashioned in the decor and definitely  not a trendy place but good straightup seafood  plenty of crabs in their crabcakes or crab balls stuffed shrimp was awesome and cocktails were good and reasonably priced just kind of a snore of a place as far as ambiencetried 3 flavors out before i decided which one i liked ended up loving the oreo flavor and going with a milkshake it was delicious sadly the only reason i can give it the full 5 stars it so whole heartily deserves was due to the portion size for 7 i was disappointed to get a sample of the delicious oreo flavored ice cream creation love the over all shop and chalkboard menu toowe think the food is ok with reference to most of their sandwiches   we are not beer drinkers but all the reviews indicate that they have a great selection  i have to take them down a star because we go to hear live music close to home and they will no longer be having any  bleh  guess its just the ale that has good food great drinks and live musica great little frozen custard place they may not have as many flavors as other shops but their custard is creamier than any other frozen custard ive tried if youre not in the mood for a large sundae the kiddie size is a great option  the only downside is that there isnt a whole lot of seating and parking may be a bit difficult to findclosed until may 2016 google maps knew it was closed but i foolishly followed the yelp app which stated it was open silly me yelp really needs to update the hours and days open for businesses   i rely on yelp but after it failed me in this instance i am wanting to consider other sources how is it that google knew the place was closeddistrict your staff is always super nice the owner who is always there is also very nice and always greets us your coffee is good and that miso praline breakfast sandwich is like the blood of virgins between two biscuits one of my favorite things to eat ever your donuts are always a treat who doesnt like a damn donut maybe a gluten free vegan but what the hell do they like anyway  contrary to what i just wrote i dont really visit anymore we got really sick of paying close to 30 to get breakfast from a donut shop that isnt full service also the last time we went there i called in an order and waited in line to get it while i was in line i saw a lady tap a man and his daughter on the shoulder while they were eating their donuts and ask them excuse me is that good first of all let this man enjoy a donut with his child in peace secondly what the hell do you think its a chocolate donut filled with rice pudding you like donuts you like chocolate you like rice pudding badda fucking bing bozo its a 250 investment donuts are like a roll in the hay even when its bad its good   clearly that experience made me realize that my neighborhood donut shop is frequented by tourists with dumb questions and intrusive behavior ill probably go back at some point on a slow day but if anyone interrupts my snarfing session with a dumb question about a glazed donut ill let one out thats so vile the whole place will be forced to evacuaterecently attended a weeding and here i dont know anything about the price but it is a pretty nice location and the food was pretty good for a wedding buffet dinner the location is right off the 101 which is convenient but it is right next to the railroad tracks and the the trains going by are very loud and obnoxious the outside seating can get chilly but they do have heat lampslast but certainly not leasthalf way through dinner there was an overwhelming odor of sewage that invaded the area for nearly ten minutesused to be a good pizza for a good price  same pizza higher prices ill go elsewherei have been going here for years and solely for their gyros unfortunately it seems like the quality has gone downhill you used to get an overstuffed overflowing pile of meat inside your pita bread and now it seems like there was only about three or four slices in there a small amount of tzatziki and it seemed like the lettuce was slightly a bit bitter i understand that the economy is crunching everybody and thank goodness this business is still alive but portions have gone down and quality has gone downthe band was great and love the ambience not much of beer drinker so u cant judge that by me the menu looked and sounded great but the food was not that great ive eaten there before and it was good just not this timei have no complaints in regards to the food quality i do however have a problem in regards to the wait time i ordered two items one time and it took almost ten minutes to get out of there it was not that busy though could do better on time but no other complaintsthis location is alright i miss you jerseys by roosevelt its located in the shoppes of park place so can be busy depending what time you are there usually ample parking on this side of the shopping plaza   service is hit or miss the handful of times ive been here management is good though in correcting mistakes i normally just get a turkey sub mikes way so i cant really speak to any of the other subs here you cant really mess up a turkey sub lol my son likes the chicken parm and hubby likes the philly cheese steak or the kahuna cheese steaki gave this joint 3 stars because of the ambience and customer service but the burgers were okay and definitely not the best i ever hadthis market is ok its an ok distance from where i live its usually pretty clean and organized the staff has always been friendly love that they have a parking lot the reason for the three stars is for the lack of cashiers during peak daystimesfood was great but service not so people are super friendly but i ordered 3 things and they all came out at the same time hot cold everything it was dead so servers were talking about life thy great but they are talking about having to be on antibiotics and how they cant poop and its like thanks guy so appetizing foods a 4 to 5 service needs training on the basics give it a try when more busy maybewe came here on sunday afternoon it was ok  they had a nice variety of tea options i was underwhelmed by the soup didnt have much flavor  the team sandwiches and pumpkin bread was delicious  the listing said it would be a full size scone i would consider what we received a mini  the reason for the 3 start and not a 4 is that prior to me arriving the groupon was marked as used which confused me because i had not arrived yet  i called to make sure there wouldnt be any confusion upon my arrival someone called me back she explained to me as part of there 24 hour rule they mark the groupon as used the day of your appointment i think this should be done either at the of the day or when the customer is finished their meal  if it was done at the end of the day it would reduce the confusion because since mines was done before i even arrived i was questioning the time of my appointment this was not a good customer experience for me  if you are going to do it in the morning than perhaps make a phone call the day before to confirm appointments or when the customer makes the appointment you communicate what will be donewas there earlier today latte was great biscuit was microwaved  employees were less than pleasant i couldnt get a hello or anything out of them silence is golden at a movie not a coffee shopdefinitely an experience i think i have finally realized that custard melts a lot faster than ice cream so its probably not the best choice for a warm summer night   while visiting stl we headed there on a monday night around 730 we only had to wait a few minutes in line we all ordered one of the smallest sizes which was plenty i ordered mine with the special cookies and devoured it pretty quickly which i needed to in order to avoid it turning to custard soup my son was not so lucky and was disappointed that he couldnt eat more of his  it was definitely worth the trip for the experience but im not sure whether it will be worth returning to againthe sushi here  is good however the place smells godawful its almost impossible to eat inside and completely unappetizing im a little too mad to go back because i ordered vegitarian sushi to go and they packed it in the same box as my mothers tuna sushi which compromised my entire vegitarian meal as her food was touching mine just not acceptable behavior for a vegitarian mealwe went here because of word of mouth unfortunately we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated and during that time no one even greeted us the food was good but it certainly wasnt worth raving aboutcame to get a fresh fruit smoothie after a long night of watching the world series and they took fresh fruit smoothie is off of the menu four months prior other than that the place looks legit seemed pretty friendly the woman at the counter was extra friendly considering that i had driven there for fresh fruit smoothie and they took them off the menu ill give this place three stars just for the atmospherethis place is packed with people need to wait almost an hour to get the table seems to be the only authentic chinese food place to go near downtown the place is decorated well but the quality of the food is so so the meat in the dish wasnt very freshi guess this is what you would get if applebees did mexican it has that very commercial chain feel to it but its overpriced and still a little bit new so it has some kinks to work out in the serving department its a pretty restaurant being a little bit more upscale my parents complained that we didnt get our own beans and rice we had to share the beans and rice with the table i cannot stand it when a restaurant nickels and dimes you given those standards im surprised they didnt charge us for the chips and salsa which were soso miguels has better chips and salsa  we saw a lot of people on dates there probably because the movie theater is attached to the same mall but i would happily go to pf changs over besitoi really want to like this place but i always leave somewhat disappointed the biggest issue for me is the menu seems to be designed for vegvegan diners who want to eat more standard nonveg food burgers bacon etc if thats what youre looking for then you may really like hcv however this focus tends to favor an emphasis on flavored soybased products over an array of fresh fruits and vegetables i think cutting down on the soy heavy meat and chicken imitations and focusing more on fresh vegcentric dishes would go a long way for hcv  still some of their food is pretty good the quinoa chili is nice in the winter their desserts are great the banana whips are a delicious healthy treat and they have really good vegan cupcakes that they bring in from a local bakery also their staff is typically very friendlyhow could this place not have been reviewed yet its an upscale supermarket here in stl years ago it was a full step above schnucks markets but now that we have super schnucks not so much still i think they are a bit on the pricy side but no as bad as strabes  this particular store is clean and well stocked and parking is never a problem i have issues with some of the marketing associated with the meat department there have been in my experience some bait and switch tactics associated with some of the sales they have any five items for 20 special the meat department has the often obscure use of special sale tags are confusing and you never know until check out that your paying more than you thought  staff outside the meat department is helpful and the lines are never too longcosi was the breakfast spot of choice this morning after three food trucks suggested by yelp were missing or closed at 715 humph found cosi on the way back to the sheraton and jumped at the breakfast sign out front yes as other yelped have noted similar feel to panera but with a more modern feel   santa fe wrap and medium coffee was 507 wrap was oknothing special but better than other optionswhich were none coffee was fine some scones etc also were available   plenty of seating inside outside and upstairs  functionality and proximity were the key words for cosi today but im not sure vibrancy or delectability would apply based on our brief visitif youre ordering a coffee drink with espresso one thing to know is that whether you order regular or large they put a double shot in this means that ordering a large latte just gets you a lot more milk than a regular which seems weird my husband ordered the nitro coffee which tasted watery and not carbonated at all fun atmosphere though and people seem to really like the donuts so maybe go for thata little over a year later they closed no warning nothing they say they are looking for a larger restaurant i find this hard to believe because they really were looking for larger site the tollytown shop a rama sonic location has been vacant for years and would be perfect for what they want they could you drive up service drivethrough service and theres a outdoor seating area but they wont because theyre closing because they suck not because it got too big for the site i wish them best of luck with their two other well established restaurantswe visited the restaurant for sunday brunch and had a nice time  the service was somewhat scattered but the manager worked hard to sort out an issue that came up with regard to our reservation  we were seated quickly    the complimentary beignets were really good and otherwise the food was good for this type of restaurant  the price  the train station atmosphere is inviting  the byob policy was also niceive swung by henrys several times to grab my morning joe and occasionally a bite to eat i havent been back in awhile and theres a reason why  average  ive tried several hot and cold coffee drinks and they underwhelm in comparison to the other local coffee shops the food  snacks are pretty good  service has always been good friendly staff and management  i would come back but wouldnt expect much out of my visitwe were told by several people to give this place a try while we were downtown a few days ago its a neat restaurant with cool atmosphere and very friendly service but i feel like its overrated while they claim they have a large draft beer selection and they do not one beer is recognizable the menu wasnt much better  the 11 burger selection is pretty out there and they dont come with any sides those are ordered separately after eating we all said it was nothing outstanding and we agreed the fries were the best part of the entire meal and they were just fries nothing special themselves the experience wasnt entirely regretful but we will not be backcame here for drinks with my family  still think the menu is subpar i believe they have a seasonal menu because things i remember ordering the first time are not listed at least this time i was coming for the beer between us all we tried many different beers  not one of us was disappointed also i did order a side of wedges  it did consist of more than four in case anyone was curiouscame in specifically to buy a vanilla cake with butter cream frosting   the lady sold me a 12 in double layer cake and said it would feed 18 to 20 ppl cost me over  50  when i picked up this huge cake a different lady said it would feed up to  35  i was a little disappointed because i didnt need so much but was excited to eat this cake   they did make a mistake on the colors i wanted for the cake but i stuck around and they were able to fix it with ease   my expectations i guess were pretty high because of all of the reviews and i was really let down   it was really just ok  there was absolutely nothing amazing about this cake   i had leftovers of course and was going to freeze it because they informed me that their cakes freeze well and i thought for what  so i tossed the rest of it    during my visit i also bought a carmel pecan apple pie choco chip and oatmeal cookies an oreo cupcake and blueberry muffins  i had to try the lot   the pie was amazing and im not a pie person   the cookies were awesome  chewy center wcrisp edges  the cupcake muffins and cake was where it felt way short for myself and the other 6 members of my family   these like items were all spongy not very moist and crumby  even the kid didnt care to eat all of his slice of cake  great pie and cookies probably isnt enough to get me to be a frequent costomer  but the customer service was good  they had my order done on time and its a convenient location   im sure they will continue to do a great business but it was just a little over rated for mei am not a huge fan of burger king  im really not  but sometimes when you have kids grandkids a full time job school and 25 hours worth of things to do in a 24 hour day sometimes its a necessary evil  ive never been in this particular burger king before however it was right near main street and we were at the new port richey christmas parade with the little ones  when a four year old starts tugging on your shirt whining gramma i gots to peeeeeee you head for the nearest bathroom no questions asked  we were all starving any way so heywhy not  thankfully enough a clean bathroom and playground are the highlights here  but you know its still burger king on a saturday night  so swarms of teenagers and always some inconsiderate fool who has no problem smoking in the playground in front of other peoples children  the area is clearly marked no smoking but invariably gets ignored by the inconsiderate inhabitants getting their fast food fix on  while this bk is clean and nice i feel i must minus a star because management refuses to speak up to the rude customers who insist on lighting up in the playground in front of the children and those of us who prefer clean air with our onion rings  i have nothing against smokers  honestly  if you want to kill yourself by smoking thats fine  no issue  theyre your lungs but innocent kids shouldnt have to breathe it inand management should protect their littlest customers its sort of in their best interest  kind of hard to order food when your clientele all have oxygen masks on from lung cancer    however if you have to stop inits not the worst place in pasco to stop for a quickie snack  and lets be realthey sell cinnabon cinnamon rolls  2 in a package for about three bucks  thats always a yummy treat for the grandkids especially right before returning them to their parents  this is called grandmas revenge and i highly recommend it   just bring a gas mask for the kidsjapanese foodnot at its best its fast food that takes some time their food is somewhat greasy such as the crazy roll or somethign that deals with spice for some reason the spicy sauce is oily and leaves a bad after taste  but i do recommend their udon its at a good price and it cant go wrong pair that with spicy tuna doesnt use the sauce mentioned abovelots of potential here but a lack of preparation for the insane crowds that came out meant many folks went away hungry    this event  which i heartily hope will return to east passyunk again in a more robust form with lots and lots more vendors  was just a victim of its own outsized buzz  bloggers the twitterati and every hungry hipster in the vicinity came out with their dogs and babies  i laughed out loud when i saw the line for tacos  you can walk two blocks in any direction from passyunk  tasker and get 3 for 5    hopefully the food trust learned they need to scale this event up if they actually want to feed anyone the interest is certainly thereupdate i deducted a star because they no longer offer their white peach pear iced tea we moved to london for work so i guess i missed the memo unaware we went for breakfast when we were in town a few weeks ago as soon as we were seated i ordered my what i thought was going to be first of many white peach pear iced tea big smile on my face  london has great hot tea but crap iced teayou really have to make it yourself usually over here at any rate  denied  waitress uh we dont have that any more  me checking the menu in disbelief mouth agape in horror what  her yeah like i dont know why they did itit was really popular  me suspicious it might actually be my own fault given how many refills i always ordered and how often we frequented turning point yeah doesnt make sense  my husband impatient and not trying to be helpful despite whatever he says just order something else me withering glare putting him on noticethinking that iced tea is the only reason i come to turning point so often you order first  after trial and error i found you can order the available as hot only white orchard tea with two accompanying glasses of ice and make your own but hell i might as well be eating breakfast in london slopping the whole table up with tea drippings and condensation plus i miss the pure joy of having a perfect white peach pear iced tea in a takeaway cup to savor while my husband is dawdling his way across home depot or something so yeah turning point  one less star take thatokay second try first try i checked in because i was here but we didnt order anything cause it was bumping on a friday night and we needed to get somewhere for that night saturday night still bumping this has to be good it has to live up to its hype  so the question youre all wondering was it worth the hype in all honesty it was okay walking in the line situation was something thats really noticeable at first you think its because this place is amazing then once you pass those second pair of doors you know why it goes out the door the counter where you order is right next to the door i think they could have planned that out a little better or at least place the register somewhere else so it doesnt get in the way of just people waiting in line or people going in and out to serve people   anyways enough about the hypeness whats up with the food i ordered i believe 4 or 5 tacos the ones that stood out in my mouth was the southern fried taco  which tacos did i order southern fried taco korean bbq taco smoked brisket i believe the local bbq i want to say the tequila lime chicken taco but i cant be positive  i know i know youre probably wondering why im even writing this if i dont even remember exactly what i ate its because they werent all that great nothing really stood out in my mind except the southern fried taco so my advice if youre going to order any taco get that one the other ones werent that amazing the korean bbq taco i ate about half of it before i got the taste of the bbq part also i dont think there was just enough meat in the taco itself   theres a lot of seating indoor and outdoor well indoor during winter is going to be limited however the seating outside is under a canopy so its not the best place to sit as far as insulation wise but its still a place to sit if its needed  all in all its alright i enjoyed the food mostly but the one piece of advice from me if you do come here to eat get the southern fried taco you wont be disappointedsad disappointment shake was amazing and food is probably good but that doesnt make up for wait time i waited so long for my food and when it came out some things were hot some where cold hence kitchen staff lacks timing skills or expediter was to quick on draw they gave me a greek salad with no dressing some food that didnt belong to me and water downed sauce for my falafel that tasted like old oilas a huge fan of italia pizza due to their vegan cheese and glutenfree crust offerings i havent ordered any pizza from castrillos due to this however due to my mischief and affection for malbec the previous evening castrillos was now an option due to their delivery service it should also be notated that i only live 2 blocks away i was not going to peel myself off the couch today  i was stoked to find out that they were able to accommodate my vegan requests by serving up spaghetti with marinara sauce dry breadsticks and a salad sans cheese the food was filling and hit the spot and was delivered in under 45 minutes i am curious to try the vegetarian sandwich but am bummed that pizza doesnt appear to be in my near future  service was friendly fast and the daily specials offered on the website are enticingtheir prices are quite reasonable i was leaning towards 4 stars but would like to try a few other items on the menu before i can commit to that hopefully some vegan cheese will be on their menu soon i will definitely order up from castrillos againlets hope that i can actually have the energy to do carryout next timeupland nachos are very good and plenty for everyone ordered pork and chicken just the right temperature 2 pints on sunday would be a great bar to watch a sporting event but the tvs are so small it is difficult to see a gamei really want to love it but a few things stop me every time  service is soooo sloooow pretty much not an option for a business lunch because you cant get in and out quickly  also dont look up  those hanging window decorations awesome but dirty dust balls hanging off of them  yucktypical cracker barrel was here for breakfast their breakfast is my favorite eggs biscuits and bacon were perfect grits need salt  service was faster than many cracker barrelswe went back a second time shortly after the first and unfortunately it just wasnt as good as the first time i actually got sick shortly after we leftlike 10 minutes i was suspicious of the goat cheese this time around and actually took it off after eating 12 the sandwich obviously i have no idea for sure it was the sandwich but once i was rid of whatever it was i was fine everything just tasted ok this time hoping this was a fluke and my first impression will keep this place thrivingbeautiful clean but regrettably noisy  nice room overlooking courtyard clean and lovely  really good complimentary breakfast  unfortunately it was as if the walls to outside were made of paper you could hear a lot of noise  if you are a partyer this may not be a problem but we are middle aged and getting up early to sightsee so we needed our sleep they told me they usually clear everyone out of the courtyard by 12 midnight or so  wow had no idea  its possible that rooms not facing the courtyard are not as loud  if it were not for this i would have given it 5 stars  but for what we paid this was too much35 stars had our first beignet and chicory coffee here and loved it service was excellent extremely friendly  tried blt and a cowboy burger the blt was loaded with bacon and tasted fine burger was a little over cooked but the bbq sauce was good ingredients were fresh and fries were tastycame here for lunch with my hubby  beautiful decor  poor and slow service  we felt like we were troubling the hostess or doing her a favor by being here  our server wasnt much better  our table was wonky and we asked him to put a beer mat under one of the legs  he gave us a look like we were insane and said he would do it and then didnt even attempt it  we did it ourselves in the end  he offered refills on my husbands coke but didnt notice my water was empty  it took about half an hour for the food to come out but it was decent  hubby got the chicken mole enchiladas and he grew up in socal breathing mexican food  and he thought they were solid  i had half spinach salad half avocado salad and a side of black beans and they were all good  would have given it 4 stars for food but with slow and marginal service it only gets 3  would prob come back if there werent so many other good places to eat close byagain 35 stars and to be fair this review is for the bakery more than the restaurant you walk into a dizzyingly beautiful display  of assorted pastries and you are overwhelmed by all the choices so you ask for help and the answer always is baklava cheesecakeok its not bad but everyone that works there had the same favorite try the question im curious now  i wish i could say all the desserts were great  trust me after five years i should have a favorite right nope still looking for something other than the baklava  when pressed i will agree the baklava cheesecake isnt bad and the tiramisu is also pretty good  the cupcakes are awful how can that even be in any case i still keep going back looking for the elusive pastry that will capture my heart enjoy the search  its a fun place regardless and a true tarpon traditioni come here for the lunch special small salad miso soup soda choice of 6 rolls crunchy california or one other option and choice of rice bowl with like chicken beef tempura etc they have 10 different bowl options in total i think the lunch special is only 11 after tax and its super reasonable i usually split the meal with someone the chicken katsu and the gyoza are my usually choices for the ricemeat bowl that they serve with the lunch special  quality here wavers some days its better than others and i wish i could rate sushiya 35 overall but you get what you pay for most rolls cost between 9 and 13 they also offer mochi as dessert at a dollar each which is ridiculous  but yea lunch special great everything else mehi think i was expecting something more here and because i was i need to go back and try them again  the concept is just a good tasting simple hamburger but i thought i would be getting something more substantial but the price does reflect what you get  it may be that i need to get 2 of these at a time to fairly compare their offerings to other food trucks  it is a good tasting burger so do try them out  just writing what i am thinking heredisappointed food okay clerks clueless i got charged for a small cheese pizza in addition to my order by a newbie cashier when i pointed out the error a more senior employee suggested she refund the overage in cash fine enough but she didnt think to tell her how to cancel the kitchen order out comes two pizzas and she refunded me less than its cost on review of events so her cash drawer will be way off and they wasted a small cheese pizza my suggestion keep an eye on them especially if everyone seems to be in trainingbasically this is a convenience store that sells food along with cigarillos and condoms great reviews convinced me to give it a try  visited at 630pm after we paid the owner brought our butter chicken after about 15 minutes apologizing that he had run out of rice and so gave four extra pieces of naan  food was tasty but not super cheap at 12 each for takeout butter chicken without rice and a few pieces of naandont hate it but dont love it ive yet to find a starbucks where they are actually moderate to quick service wise and i just mean to take my order obviously it takes time to make coffee  i went to this location on a saturday to try the new smores frap there was one guy ahead of me he was ordering a bag of coffee it took the lady a really long time to get him this coffee meanwhile 3 other employees walked around behind the counter looking at me but not asking me if i needed help i continue to wonder why this part of the starbucks chain fails at every locationcupcakes are great for the most part a couple of the frostings are sickening sweet but love the birthday cake pink frosted fruit had blueberry and berry the only real problem is the packaging the cardboard insert is so shallow any slight tip sends the top heavy cupcakes on their side making a huge mess and ruining themleave the pasteries take the cannolis  literally only good for those the cakes and pies not nearly as good herei was referred to johns by a friend who said the ritas wasnt a true representation of good water ice and that i should go to johns   yes johns is a lot simpler with only 5 flavors cherry chocolate peach pineapple and one other it does taste a lot healthier and like it has less sugar but the peach ice that i had was nothing out of the ordinary not much flavor at all ill stick with ritasi used to be a big fan of ted drewes actually i lived right around the block on francis park so i frequented this st louis institution quite often however during my last few visits i have been extremely disappointed with the amount of toppings that they put in my concrete i normally order a chocolate concrete with reeses and oreos but ive had to play wheres waldo to find any pieces of treats in my concrete  last visit i ordered the smores concrete and had to do the same there were only three tiny pieces of graham cracker so sad   these days i live right around the block from another frozen custard stand not going to drop any names but when i order a chocolate concrete there it is overflowing with my toppings both on the inside and on top it almost has more toppings than custard  woohoo and the custard is actually very chocolatey to think about it perhaps my next house will be around the corner from a fruit stand or farmers marketthat may be a little easier on my waistline  ok ok now i have to divulge that i am 8 months pregnantso i think that makes me a very credible frozen custard and ice cream critic bottom line ted drewes please stop being skimpy on the toppings it only disappoints the kids and pregnant ladies and nobody wants that  and we know business is goodguys and galsyou can handle itnot a lot of tables for seating and the wait is long the flavors are unique and crafty i can see why theres so much hype for this trendy place  but if you just want a quick sweet treat better off getting a frosty at wendys across the street if you dont mind waiting get a cutesy little ice smile treat yummy but average  found on yelp and glad it was close to home  they claim to be food from the hill and it was a lot like moms deli  the food was ok wait kinda stunk but the guy who took our order and delivered food to the table was awesome very nice and funi enjoyed almost everything we ordered here and i plan to return for more of sylvias comfort food their simple mac n cheese was delicious the collard greens were cooked exactly the way i like them and the cornbread was good and served toasty warm  my partner had the oxtail which was the daily special and it was extremely flavorful and tender  i had the harlem style chicken  waffles the fried chicken was tasty with crispy skin although the waffles themselves were just okay they were a too soft for my taste   the dessert peach cobbler was a mushy and overly sweet disappointment    their service was friendly with no annoying hovering and their decor was tastefully simple extremely clean and well lit   we look forward to having another meal here ive heard the ribs are great although i will probably skip dessertim not sure exactly when it happened but the prices at wct have jumped a lot the 3 for 5 deal appears to have been replaced by 3 for 850 say what i get it the price of meat has gone up but thats a pretty steep increase especially since i need to eat 4 of those little tacos to really feel full it puts the price of a meal over 1100 guess this is going to turn into a rare occasion kind of meal for me instead of a havetohaveit kind of mealyeah i like this place its pretty average but also pretty reasonable and decent it has a super cute atmosphere if that sorta thing matters to you the milk shakes will knock your face off they are so good and the food will make your tummy happy even the corned beef hash was pretty delightful and not everyone does that well they do the service is good too lunch isnt my favorite here but breakfast is greatthe calamari was soso and the food was just average i got the chicken fried rice and it wasnt anything to write home about the sushi was okgood pizza with fresh ingredients the crust is average we mostly do take out i think weve eaten at the restaurant once i see it more of a lunch atmosphere for dinning in but they have added beer and wine to improve this i believe the staff has their highs and lows in terms of customer service but we keep coming back for the consistency of the pizzai purchased four of the small square cakes to sample as i hadnt been to swiss haus since chef jim took over in 2008  while the quality has improved im still not a fan of thin slices of cake surrounded by generous amounts of sweet fluffy icing which would be a mouse if it was thicker in consistency and probably a product that i would more enjoy  the carrot cake was more to my liking  lots of nuts and a nice cream cheese icing  i would imagine that the strawberry shortcake is a winner based on the style of many of their other cakes  the service was good friendly and helpful  my friend and i stopped in a bit after 5p on a wednesdayi have no major issues with apollos its close to home and the service is generally always on point ive eaten through here numerous times over the years and it tends to be the spot everyone goes to that lives in the area personally its not my first choice im not here to give shout outs to other businesses so ill keep it at that the food is just okay for me i will make a positive note that they do have some pretty fat cheesesteaks so if youre looking for a  joint that doesnt bum you out on the lack of meat come here for sure im a huge fan of white pizza and for some reason theres something missing from theirs will i eat from here again yeah its hard not tobreakfast was good good bang for your buck  however not the biggest fan of the shredded and fried lunch meat that came with it but it was practically an extra anyway  the service is what cost it 2 stars coffee is 3 but the server never refilled my water or coffee  thats pretty bad anyway you look at it and she definitely wasnt busy unless chatting with coworkers countsi really miss the tofu and spicy eggplant i always get half chow mein and half steamed vegetables mostly very good but under no circumstances should you even put one of those awful carrots into your mouth i cant imagine what they have done to the carrots but they taste like poison  and maybe cut the broccoli just a little bit moregreat service quick and efficient bison burger was great and sweet potato fries done well  three stars because my kale salad had cashews instead of roasted hazelnuts and dried cranberries instead of dried cherries and i wasnt informed of the change i had never been here before so i thought i had mixed up two salads and ordered the wrong one when i double checked later on for sure had different ingredients than listed on the menu didnt worry about sending back the salad was fine but not a 10 salad for surethis place definitely feeds into that overhype for a restaurant in which the ambiance is cute but the seating is limited the food is pretty but only good and not deserving for the price you pay the service is pretty decent and the ingredients seems pretty fresh if youre going for a cute place to brunch id pick other locations that come up when you search if its a weekday and this is convenient than i probably would be okay going here but i definitely would not recommend it to be worth the trip on the weekendsfirst timewe had heard good things about this restaurant  microbrewery it didnt dissapoint food was between good and great appetizers were the best including the shishito peppers and macncheese beer was good tooespecially their unique offering pisteleroa smoke infused pilsner  overall nice experiencea bit over priced but good if you need to pick something up quick and they do have an atm there which is a pluslocal grassfeed beef appeals to my middleclass whiteness but not when said beef has the dryness of a cardboard big mac container i like my chardonnay dry not my sustainably sourced meatnot your average american chinese restaurant the sauces have a different delicacy to them they are definitely more of an authentic version my partner got general tsos chicken and the sauce was absolutely delish it starts out with a little bit of sweet then sour like vinegar and them bam the warmness of the hot chilis kicks in i had the chicken in garlic sauce chicken and unfortunately because it was so saltyi meanreally salty i like salt normallythat i could only take a few bites and that was the end of the meal for me i took it home and threw it in our compost pile to recycle for the vegetable garden next year next time ill get the general tsos the egg drop soup was good too though i never had it with corn in it beforea totally different taste sensation service was attentive and other than the back of my vinyl booth being torn the restaurant was quite clean  i wont write this place off yetit wasnt my favorite bar of the bar hop the beers on tap on this particular day were just to craft for my liking the unique decor is nice but not inviting definitely not allot of space to hang with a group i do appreciate another brewery in the seminole heights area so ill be back to give it another whirlbff and i had been dying to try this place and this was our first visit got there at 900 just before the rush and were seated on the patio right away by the friendly hostesses hostii promptly greeted with water and menus for drinks a fuzzy navel mimosa and a meinkes mayor  both delicious and a good value at 5 and 6 respectively for breakfast i ordered the monte cristo while my friend ordered the sweet potato hash we were unimpressed with each menu item both were bland and it seemed everything was undercooked from the potatoes in the country hash to the brioche in the monte cristo consensus ill give it another chance as some other entrees passing by our table looked enviable and the service is super duper look out am relleno youre on my listdollar tacos were alright beer was a little expensivewe asked a group of locals for a lunch suggestion and uncle mikes was the unanimous response when we arrived the aroma of smoked meats greated us out in the parking lot we arrived for a lateish lunch or early dinner the staff seemed nice and the food was good i can see how it would be a jumping place at night too if we ever find ourselves close by we would stop againthis goleta location presents a fascinatingly diverse slice of life the crossroads of local humanity  this is where the supposed downtrodden and common masses become royalty  to wit  a man in a grungy work shirt and baseball cap with swank mullet peeking out requested the staff clean his table my good man a wipe down for this table if you please an elegant silverhaired woman sitting near me fingers covered in tasteful rings chomps on her burger adjacent to borderline homeless and a group of newage travellers scratching their heads over how they managed to get off track on their roadtrip to humbolt   but most notable  speedy on all counts truly in and out  i had to leave work early today thanksslightly overrated but not bad i respect that its been open for so long and continues to operate at relatively low prices  that being said i would have preferred more variety my cherry and pineapple ice was quite good but ive had better in philly  i would come back here but i wouldnt seek it there must be better places to get italian ice around these partsok coming along this visit upgrades spasso to a place where you actually might try eating  visited midweek with about 6 people this time and got the standard start we wait five minutes in the foyer while staff mill about a notclosetofull restaurant doing i dont know what after being seated though everything went right  our server a lady with a european accent was much more attentive and welcoming this time that helps she was nice enough to make a reasonable suggestion for someone who had a sense of what she wanted but didnt want to traverse the menu to find it the waitress assured her they could make what she was describing  the wine list has enough selections that you should be able to find something you like we got some bread appetizers drinks etc and were neither being hurried along nor ignored another positive and 180 degrees from prior visits  i think it may be wise to order the specials as they seem to put some attention and care into those we all found the entrees to be flavorful and attractively presented another positive is we did not experience the dumped from a jar feel of some of the accouterments like the last couple of times   so i upgrade spasso to worth a try but be ready for a hit or miss experience so far for what its worth wednesday has proved to be our best night there sunday looks like a nofly zonewe had lunch here a few weeks ago  found the place on a list of best burgers in st louis there was nothing wrong with the food but the actual burger patties werent that great i would describe the selection as having a large and interesting variety of burger toppings but the patties and buns were just ok i would check out other burger joints before returning i had a mint chocolate chip shake that was great and the fries and house made rooster sauce mayo  sriracha  grainy mustard were good tooi went here for the lunch buffet the other day and i need to come back and order off the menu like most buffets the food has to appeal to a broad palette so it was a bit too bland and mild for me but the variety they offered was goodi love chickfila but the last three times ive visited this location over a two month period this location has not been as clean as in the past  tables are dirty and the bathrooms are not as clean as they used to be  definitely not what you expect when eating at chickfilaok so me and a few friends went here after the reo speedwagonstyx concert and had some good drunk food    the sweet and spicy wings were seriously tasty but needed a little more heat to even be considered mild  the burgers were just ok in need of a little seasoning which is an amateur mistake if you ask me  the parmesan garlic fries were amazing  very garlicy and cheesey    their beer selection isnt bad  im glad they have one of my favorite everyday wheat beers hoegaarden on tap  yum  id go back just for thatits bee a while since ive been here and my last visit i ordered breakfast this visit i ordered lunch which im disappointed in i had the marinated chicken sandwich minus the bun and was shocked to see it was not a fresh chicken breast but yet a precooked breast they just reheated for a small establishment i would have expected a fresh grilled chicken breast not processed   i have to praise the waitstaff seems they were multi taskingthe price was really great and the food was pretty decent but the service left a little to be desired  for a small business i usually expect a little extra on the service sidebut to be fair it was really early in the morning and i totally understand the morning sluggishness  i would have probably gotten a coffeedrink but they didnt offer any nondairy alternatives  i wouldnt mind going back if it was on the way but i also wouldnt go out of my way to get herehad lunch there today so far the best burger ive had in boise went with my daughter a cheeseburger 2 fries 2 sodas and a corn dog set me back 10  the burger was cooked appropriately dressed with fry sauce and fresh cool veggies and served nicely wrapped the corn dog was nothing special the fries were good but not fabulousbut wow plenty of them  all in all a fine place to go for a burger if youre in the area  warningi hear they charge extra for fry suace which is bs but i didnt have any so i dont know for surei really like the design and layout of this coffee house  seats were comfortable with adequate spacing between tables  ambience was nice with a mixture of tables and sofa seats  i would give them 5 stars for this  i ordered a ham and guyerre quiche  for my daughters a blueberry muffin and apricot scone along with two hot chocolates and a white chocolate mocha  took forever for the food to come out  the quiche had nice flavoring but the consistency was too runny  they need to adjust the recipe in this blueberry muffin was ok nothing to write home about  apricot scone was the best one and tasted professionally done  we had already finished with our food before the drinks arrived  one hot chocolate had to be sent back because it was basically milk with no chocolate in it  my 9 year old took one sip and said it tasted funny  they were gracious enough to take it back and it was fine after that  my coffee was ok but i prefer starbucks better  overall this is a good place to go to meet friends and chit chat if you have the time but they really need to work on their service and food  service was very friendly i am talking about the timeliness of it  not sure i will be going back3 days here been here twice incredible pancakes we got the buckwheat pancakes the first time most gluten free option very delicious would highly recommend   the second time we got the banana batter pancakes with pecans the sweet potato pancakes and cornbread pancakes of all these the sweet potato was best but the buckwheat ones were the best the sweet potato and banana were too sugary for my taste   two stars down because the eggs were very eh and the line was really long expect to wait we waited over an hour to get in and on top of that we waited another 50 minutes to get our foodsorta pricey for a taiwanesechinese restaurant but the food is pretty good  had the  1 beef noodle soup 45 my fav compared to everything else below 2 stinky tofu 35 great for stinky tofu firsttimers it was just stinky enough that you wont get traumatized but honestly it was a watereddown version of true stinky tofu it was pungent on the outside but the inside lacked flavor 3 tofu and baby bok choy 35 good for vegetarians unlike most chinese restaurants where their veggies are always dunked in oil this dish is healthy and good on its own i personally think they can add more garlic thoughquick review 3  let me fist say that i am not a fan of drinking spirits straight we had friends who asked us to go to their free tasting they offer the first friday of the month   atmosphere   3  the building is in an old hardees you can tell they are making improvements its a new business so that is how i gave the rating otherwise i would have given a 1 it is in need of a lot of work   food  none   staff   4  the owner gets a five star but the one bartender was a bit slow there was a long line to wait in to get drinks   drinks   3 they do offer mixed drinks  the one i had was good it was tiny for 8 again i can not drink spirits without a mixer   all in all  3 we might go back for a tasting if we are in the area and because its near 4 handsso for as hyped as this place was to be honest i was expecting more we went on a saturday evening where the temp was still 95 at 7pm this is important because we were told the wait would be ten minutes and it was at least a half hour the waiting area was hotter than it was outside everyone waiting was miserable once we got seated the temperature improved a little but there was not enough air for the space or the volume i was also unimpressed by the burgers the price is high 912 per burger and this does not include anything except a burger homemade ketchup which i did not care for and a pickle which was exquisite also they ask you how you would like your burger cooked if it is ground meat there should not be any redpink so naturally to avoid getting sick i asked for medium well my burger was dry and lacking in taste overall i choose the special smoke and fire my dates burger was slightly better he got the american but i was still not won over especially for the price  now to the good the wait staff was friendly and attentive not so much the hostbut that might be attributed to the heat the drinks were superb i got the sweet raspberry ice tea and was blown away and my date enjoyed one of his favorite local beers from their extensive selection the fries were good i recommend asking for them well done and the homemade cheese sauce and horsey mayo were delicious dip choices also the crowning glory was the sweet sweet bacon milkshake we shared for dessert this is an epic bacon bourbon caramel wonder that you will never forget i dont even care for bourbon and this stole my heart  overall come here for ice cream drinks or fries but leave before the main dishyou can do betterawesome prices  decent breakfast  the food is decent not amazing not bad while unremarkable the food is very good for the money i almost feel bad writing a 3 star review for them because its stupid cheap i felt like i was eating ihop now ihob quality for waffle house prices the scrambled eggs skillet was the highlight of my meal the pancakes were dry and not fluffy and made worse by the cheap syrup in the super sticky bottle  the atmosphere is like a lincoln square  johnny rockets and the crowd featured many incessant baby cries i typically break fast on my weekends at a cracker barrel southport or 38th lincoln square by iupui and or charlie browns by speedway i would advise sticking to that list unless you are already west of the i465 loopi really wanted to love this place but im a little underwhelmed  the place is lovely the service is good but slow  the packaging very cute but takes to long to do it  the red velvet cake didnt taste too much like a red velvet cake and it doesnt need to extra sugar on the outside it is really sweet as is  the coconut cake has a nice flavor but i found the cake to be very dense and compacted  for the price i expected to love the cakes and crave to come back not the case  perhaps the other flavors are betterwilliam m said it exactly right about this place  httpwwwyelpcombizcasitataqueriasaintpetersburghridw2jxtylmnogciwtdbzigxw   my husband and i have frequented casita taqueria since we moved to st pete   pros food is definitely fresh from the salad to the rice bowls guacamole flautas even desserts everything is fresh you can not only see but taste that the vibe both inside and in the back outdoor seating is funky and fun staff is friendly good value for a meal in the casita bowl or salad only place locally ive found freshly made flautas sofar churros when they have them whoa heaven i dont usually like pico de gallo raw onion grosses me out but this rendition is yummy  cons i dont eat a lot of meat and when i do i insist its high quality there are very few vegetarian options and no meat substitutes i dont like a ton of spices on my fish or shrimp they both come heavily covered with a kind of chipotle spice mixture and ive asked many times they wont give me plain proteins everything is preseasoned as for the chicken i have gotten chewy fatty pieces a few times and this totally turns me off this is totally tragic because i want to eat here   homemade hot sauces are just ok a little vinegary and unbalanced for my taste   all in all we enjoy this local spot we stop by for lunch often but lately i find myself less tolerant of the protein issues give me plain shrimp just a little salt and pepper is all they need free range chicken or better yet tempeh ill be here every other day ill wait for you casita taqueria until thenbreakfast visit and wish i could report back epic stuff but alas i cannot makes me sad sharing that a 30 breakfast just didnt hit the spot for two people what the heck  first the artichoke and ham omelet for nearly 11 is a massive disappointment not much of an omelette and was served with 2 sourdough toasts that quite frankly tasted a little just a little better than the omelette the cheese was partially melted in the omeletteseriously thats a big no no the artichoke was alright and the ham wasnt great   the granola pancakes were tasty but not fluffy and lots of air holes you get 4 thin ones for roughly 11  we were asked if bottomless coffee was what we wanted and of course that sounds awesome right wellskip it cause for nearly 350 youre just paying for unlimited refills which doesnt make much sense considering everywhere else lets you get bottomless coffee for under 250 or thereabouts we had to ask for milk since they dont keep that at the coffee bar  service is mehthey are somewhat friendly at the bar but theres no table service and it feels awkward if they clean the table or if youre supposed to do ithowever they dont mind asking for a tip when you pay for your order also they give you a number its a stand that has a number and you take it to your table they should try to adopt what chickfila has and go with colors or what mud house does with animal faces i dont know something better than a number   will i be back probablybut when theres other choices nearbyyou knowi wanted to like this place a lot but it just didnt happen this time i am hoping that i can give them another try because i am a burger fanatic and would love to enjoy a good nonmcdonalds burger every once in a while i came here around 930 pm and ordered a double trenton burger with ketchup mayonnaise pickles and raw onions along with fries and an oreo milkshake the milkshake was decently good there were too many fries and they were a tad on the dark side for me there needs to be a good frytoburger ratio in my opinion when ordering a burger and fries what am i gonna do with a whole bunch of fries after im done my burger i wish theyd charge less and give less fries on to the 9 burger it was okay but fell short in so many ways and thats ultimately why this place only gets 3 stars it seemed to lack seasoning as there was little taste to the burger the bottom bun had also gotten soggy and flat from the other ingredients and sort of fell apart in my hand as i was grasping the burger for whatever reason the pork roll didnt add much to the already unseasoned burger wouldve maybe been better if there were two pork rolls on the double burger and if the beef patties were seasoned more thoroughly with at least salt and pepper i could not even taste salt at all i wanted to fall in love with the burger so badly but the lack of flavor each time i took a bite was just so disheartening id like to give this place a try when im having another cheat meal in a week or two i hope my next experience will be better and that this was just a oneoffim stuck between 3 and 4 stars its a 5oz burger and for 6 bucks you can get more meat elsewhere but whats really going for them are their ingredients beautiful roll letuce tomato and especially the meat like a good steak the first bite had that blood red greese dripping onto the parchment not too greesey overall its pretty much a classic allamerican burger joint with minimal offerings of shakes and fries   this is definitely a lunch place but as good as the burgers are i cant afford a 10 lunch most days a good tip a friend gave me was that an order of fries are quite ample so go with a friend get two burgers and a fry to share  i wish it blew my mind but it didnt its a solid hamburger thoughnot what i expected first time to tarpon springs very touristy area and in addition to sponges you could buy everywhere lots of the usual tourist tees magnets glasses etc the hellas has a nice looking bakery if you are looking for sugar and gluten we were there for the greek food at lunch time the place was packed and it was huge noisy dark and bustling the menu had dolmas spanokapitas and other goodies but as dinner plates not as appetizers and they were a little pricey their combo plate was close to 20 also a little much for lunch we settled on gyros classic greek well if you are into lots of meat this is the sandwich for you it was big wrapped in a yummy warm pita but had very little of what adds flavor to the dryness of the lambbeef rotisserie very little onion lettuce tomato i had to ask for more tzatziki sauce what came out was basically a thick sour cream very little of the yogurt garlic cuke flavor that you expect really im used to juices running down my arm this was kind of  boring meat meat more meat the couple next to us had ordered a soup concluding ive had better greek soup than this it wasnt bad it just wasnt what you expect coming to a town with the greek reputation ts has ive had much better in gulf breeze florida near pensacola beach i want garlic breath   worth a try if you like gyro meat youre in luckwe were looking forward to a nice dinner at tre lune for our anniversary unfortunately we were very disappointed our waitperson was very cold and abrupt with our service there was simply zero interaction if this was a diner i would overlook this but not a restaurant serving a community such as montecitothe pizza was good not the best i have had seemed like too much sauce and not enough cheese but i do have to say i had it delivered and they were at my house before the online time said it would be and it was still hot all in all ill still order from herethe only thing i liked about this place was the taro boba tea which im obsessed with anything taroi probably need an intervention but thats for another conversation the pad thai was mediocre and i dont want no mediocre ill come back for the bobabasically if you want to buy some cupcakes to go pretty good spot  5 stars but pretty pricey for a togo activity if you want to sit down and eat a cupcake with one other adult friend also a 5 star activity but worth the money bc of the cute shop and experience  with that said my experience bringing children 1 star there is no part of this place that is kid friendly and i dont have kids  just nieces and nephews  so that doesnt usually bother me but i wanted to bring my nieces here for their birthdays and only realized once i got here that it was a terrible idea which sucked bc i dont really know too many adults who want to sit down and share a cupcake in a cupcake store   children cant see the high display of cupcakes unless you pick them up because of our group three adults two babies and a four year old there was only one part of the shop that we could all fit bar chairs and tables  cant sit on and hold a baby at the same time the four year old needed help getting up and down off of the chair and constant vigilance bc a fall off of the bar stool wouldve been a disaster the four year old was also thirsty and infused water is cute for adults but kids think its disgusting the paper dixie cups dont hold enough water  even for the four year old and not having a top on them sometimes ends in wet situations luckily not this day then there wasnt anymore water and you cant eat a cupcake when your mouth is dry  meltdown so sorry to the workers and other patrons for that my sis and i had to inhale the cupcakes and we took the kids cupcakes to go im not giving up on this place but rearranging the shop a little to have more seating for groups larger than two and closer to the ground making sure theres water easily available with cups larger than shot glasses and figuring out a better way to display the goods for all sizes of people wouldve made our experience really enjoyable rather than resulting in the kind of story i tell my boyfriend when he talks about wanting kids  previous experience 5 stars i went here 15min before closing so naturally i figured i was going to get a dried out crusty cupcake because it was the end of the day nope i didnt ask when they made it but it was super moist and delicious and exactly what i wanted at the time great service great selection i left very happyok i get it donuts are great nice to be able to get a parking service is friendly and place is cool but 250 for a donut 20 for a dozen at least offer a free cup of coffee with that dozen  i hear the chicken is awesome but i was in such shock after my donut tab i had to go sit down and regroup next time ill get chicken but definitely skip the donuti used to work at this shop and save a long time ago in a galaxy far away well thats what it seems like  when i stopped in here to pick up a couple of things for dinner  i hadnt been in this location for quite some time years in fact and after my last visit i am sure its going to be years more before i return  while i navigated around the store i kept noticing the difference in appearance it looked from the years i worked there the store was clean however i didnt find the employees to be that friendly nor helpful   i was able to find what i was looking for however i wasnt expecting to stand in a line for about 15 minutes waiting to check out there was only 3 lines open and only one of the express self checkouts was in operation  i did see one cashier still working there from the days when i was there however she was so over the place and looked like she had had enough i didnt even bother talking to her to find out how things were compared to when we worked together because it was obvious  i tend to stay away from shop and saves and now after this last visit i will stay away for good and just stick to my schnucks where  know i will get  treated good and have a satisfying shopping experience3500 winehaus is a nice local wine bar and a welcomed addition to the neighborhood they have two outdoor areas a front patio and a back patio both are covered and heated in the cool weather months they also have a small wine bar inside and a couple of sofas  service seems to be the biggest drawback if you come with a group it will throw them off additionally they get a little pissy if they seat you outside and you go to the bar for service even if you are not getting served in a timely manner and table service is inadequate also dont go hungry they only have cheese and sausage plates to offer no upscale cheese and meat choices very basic  my only other complaint is that there are no high top tables the bar is small and the rest of the seating is low they would do really well if they added a substantial amount of high tops so that people can mingle a bit especially since they dont have much room in the bar  overall its a nice place but i will not be there often because i am social and like to mingle in a wine bar and its not really set up for thatwell now that they have gotten more popular so i guess they think its safe to cut back a bit less meat less bread and omg its mostly iceberg lettuce now  do i still its worth it  definitely  i guess im a little spoiled because i was there when they were first opened the servings were much better and they used romaine lettuce only  the meat on the spit could be better  el greco is a greek place in sarasota  they have meat on spit as well but somehow theirs doesnt look dried out on the spit  you can see because its visible from the window as you walk by the restaurant  love the staffok so love that there was a dog to greet us upon entry so friendly we went up to bar and the lady was very informative she gave everyone a sample of every beer they had on tap i didnt get any since i was driving i tasted some of my husbands though and really only liked two of them you can buy bullets which is 32oz bottles as carry out but you couldnt drink there otherwise i found it strange but it is just a tasting room they did have some pretty creative names for their beers that were for next week makes me want to go back just to try them40 minute ticket time on a callin order with a 15 minute estimate no apology i get that youre busy just be honest about itwe waited outside for a hot minute and was not worth the wait server was great seafood etouffe was good boo fries decent  char grilled oysters were a 6 out of 10 felixs accross the street is better if you know what to ordermy family and i have been going here for a long time  they have a consistent wait staff who are always very polite it depends on when you go for fresh food  the sat 10 lunch or lunch time is the best value   ive had one bad experience but we went back and they were super nice and accommodating to usi was really looking forward to trying this place today even though they just opened i thought i would give them a chance it got off to a rocky start when we arrived at 11 am and they were still prepping the restaurant for service people mopping the floors etc nothing like being really hungry and smelling cleaning solutions i have only had poke at poke loa so i am not an expert but to me momos poke ingredients are just strange carrots radishes and they were kind of stingy with them the toppings at poke loa are way yummier the pork ramen dish was pretty good i will say and the spicy pork dumplings appetizer was pretty good as well another knock would be that our waitress smelled like an ashtray also management should let the waitresses know that patrons do not want to hear their personal stories about their lives while they are trying to enjoy lunch it was a constant yapping session   i will definitely come back for the ramen i would never get the poke again and i would like to try some other appetizers the place has only been open for a little while so i do expect things to get betterdeeply disappointed that this once vegetarian restaurant has started serving meat at the same time food quality in general seems to have taken a dip i am grateful they still serve some vegan dishes but things there have not changed for the betterso new spot for katie and some rough patches flatbread pizza with salume beddu had so much lemon it was inedible and bitter arugula spoiled the delicacy of capellini artichoke salad delicious and wait staff though harried competent why however would prominent southeast window look out on trash containers eeesh put up one of teds paintingshad brunch and i must say that the website sold me in coming here been awhiles since i had a hearty frenchy type of meal and it was definitely tempting but i dunno   prices were fairly appropriate um from the ghini delights for those who are watchin their weight kudos their provencale must say their hash browns were mighty yummy a lil overboard with butter but it was oh so damn yummy and their bread was excellent mmm  awesome bread   another downer uncomfy chairs  anyhoo overall it would be an average of a 2 star but i will say that the bathroom made me give ghini an extra star    ladies  dont fret a handy tampon tray that always come in handy  excellent for those who are being punished with mother nature  you on a date scope mouth wash with cute lil cups to rinse your mouth and more did i ever tell you i carry around a bottle of mouth wash in my car too  yes my ex was a dentist so id be super paranoid in having my breath stink even though i truly believe mouth wash is for cheaters but doesnt hurt to have an eatery with mouthwash   now for the bathroom downers this is just  my own personal preference  whats up with having the toilet paper roll across from you i dont know about you all but i sure dont like getting up and having my cheekies smooch one another bleh its ok definitely over hyped its a step above ihop but nothing to write mother abouti also used the coupon in this app for the free appetizer the value is 9 so if you want the nachos youll pay 2 for that  while not that busy service was slow which seems a common problem we ordered the whole shebang platter which included all their meats and four sides the brisket was on par with salt and smokes fatty in other words great the sausage was cold same with the pulled pork the ribs were very good nice pull but very tender there was also sliced turkey several very tasty sauces as to the side baked beans just average cole slaw was micro chopped if you catch my drift very strange green beans were average the fried potatoes were very good my wifes crown royal with a splash of soda was 10 pricey in my opinion this is not an inexpensive place  a regular stop on our errand circuit and a godsend during the winter months   the positives are the generally good prices the regular appearance of high end items such as black garlic purple asparagus figs and heirloom tomatoes  the sizable  array of chilis and peppers and the lovely fresh flowers   a concrete example of pjs great pricing  three bunches of cilantro for 2 versus one bunch for 199 at tanners     the downsides are the divided fruit and vegetable counters forcing a shopper to stand in multiple lines the uneven produce quality some items appear to be seconds and unreliable inventory cant rely on any particular item being in stock and the cashonly sale terms  i also dont love the fact that you cant select your own fruit and veggies prebagged and the absence of scales so you can check the weight of itemsmy boyfriend and i had a groupon we didnt have to drive long to find a street parking this is an adorable little corner location  my boyfriend has the moles enchiladas and had the eggplant vegetarian dish the mole enchiladas were a traditional hispanic dish and it brought back memories of studying abroad in costa rica the eggplant dish was poorly seasoned with little to know flavor in addition it was really hot and ice cold in other places which was confusing however the eggplant was well cooked and not mushy also it had a beautiful presentation   why the three stars this is a small location and my boyfriend and i went at the end of october we sat next to the door because that was the only spot opened there was a party in the upstairs room and the wait staff kept opening and closing the door allowing cold air in and the people arriving at the party kept the door open constantly too i asked for caf de olla despite being eight oclock at night because i was frozen i told the waiter i was very cold and so was my boyfriend he said he would try to keep the door open which didnt happen my boyfriend got up several times to shut the door the waiter also forgot the coffee so i was annoyed and my boyfriend felt bad the food was fairly good but the atmosphere of the meal took away from it leaving it disappointingso disappointed fries overlooked burger undercooked ordered an egg on my burger and it was runny which made the bottom bun uselessi like this place more as a local experience than an italian market most cities have an italian store such as mazzaros imported sauces olives cheeses and meats are sold along with prepared foods and made to order sandwiches what makes mazzaros unique is the hordes of customers as in every other local place the people are  exceptionally polite and patient   at the sandwich counter you take a number and despite the hovering crowd you are amazed when your number is called almost as soon as you dispensed it but it is only to take your order you then join the waiting crowd after a lengthy wait you receive your sub wrapped in butcher paper then a wait at one of two cashiers   there are shelves and coolers  crammed with anything remotely italian a coffee counter a screened in patio and a few outdoor tables those on work lunch hours somehow find a place to eat    on my recent visit i had the number 2 which is called the italian anywhere else  both the soft salami and the provolone were tightly rolled and placed in the middle of the bread the italian cole slaw needs vinegar and the tomato and lettuce were hardly noticed more dressing and the ingredients layered rather than rolled may have improved this sandwich as it was each mouthful was of too cold provolone and too cold genoa salami or just bread the bread is so chewy my jaw got tired and i had to store the sandwich in the refrig for later not my favorite sub by any means at 5 it is really hard to complain i think the hot sandwiches i have had are much betteri always do mobile orders so that way as im on my way to work i can just pick it up no wait i usually order about 15 minutes before im actually there and it says say itll be ready in 56 minutes its literally never ready most of the time they havent even started it i understand if theyre extremely busy but every single time totally defeats the purpose on mobile ordersparking is usually not a problem but sometimes it is if caseys is packed prices vary but look for salesthere can be some good ones customer service has been good for me over the years store is pretty easy to navigate the pharmacy gets backed up from time to timethis review is a really tough one to write there are two aspects to this store the selling of brewing equipment and their outward servicey aspect  for the gear id like to rate a little lower maybe two stars their cardinal sin running out of liquid malt extract honestly we quit shopping for supplies here bc three times in a row they were out of pale lme that stuff is pretty common and additionally the dry me is super expensive anywhere you buy it its so common itd be like a grocery store running out of bread they also dont have an amazing selection of hops and yeast often they are out of some varieties  on the other hand they regularly host free beer tastings from local and out of state breweries put on a great show organize food trucks and have a quaint little tap room with 45 rotating taps this part makes me wish i lived down the street  so there you go three stars is the compromise i dont want these guys to go away i just want them to up their game in terms of sales  stockhad an early dinner with my friend here a few weeks ago we split three apps octopus malohwa and lamajun they were all fine no complaints  we had decent outdoor seating too  however there was nothing too mind blowing about this place it was all very adequate i would by no means steer people away from here but id simply state to expect a satisfactory dining experience and nothing morereally enjoyed the ambienceoutdoors in great weather  foodraw oysters  smoked fried oysters were excellent the touffe was not remarkable which was disappointing cause this new orleans  it should be the best the bar menu was good  the service was spotty the main server was greathis helper was not so goodthis arbys been here many years and parking lot and inside is forever empty  i think there best thing is deli sandwiches roast beef is of poor to barely fair quality its very expensive for fast food  quality doesnt match pricing  usually when i eat here i regret it pity one would think that there signature item would be outstanding  not at all many other places to chose from i pass by here every day on my way to work and i try to stop in as much as i can but theres one problem i almost never carry cash  yes good karma is a great coffee house the coffee is pleasant though a little on the expensive side  a small is 2 im used to closer to 150 for drip not starbucks burnt and the baked goods are sometimes vegan and always yummy the staff is low key and really friendly the interior itself is huge  several rooms  which means that youre not wanting for table space they also have a nice outdoor seating area and a dog bowl of water for thirsty pups   but there is one drawback cash only it is the one factor that has me going to the starbucks three blocks away more often than not because of that i get why a business would be cash only  im sure there are many factors  but cmon its 2011 no one really carries cash any moregreat happy hour and nice selection of drafts  i love that they have dairy freevegan options for free i dont think anyone here expects authentic mexican food the food is fine service has been really great and friendly as opposed to the university city location which leaves much to be desired  heres the thing while i understand that mad mex has a party atmosphere in university city this is the burbs you need to modify your business based on your demographic loud music is fine and dandy on a friday evening but when youre trying to have a friendly drink at 5pm on a tuesday the noise level is just annoying tone it down a little and i think you will get more businesswe had ice cream crepe and a sandwich here the food is good but nothing memorable   a weird thing happen a guy asked for my husbands name and wrote it down he also manually enter the number in the system as well as looking at the back quite slowly my husband was super sketched out but nothing happened so far they might just took the name for the order and the cashier is new so he was figuring his way out with cards but be careful just in case thoughdecent prices and variety of tacos  however my fish taco was very bland and seemed like the fish was boiled  also the donuts had a good taste but ultimately were dry  this is good for a quick meal but not my top 5 places to grab a tacothis is a pretty solid mexican food truck you can pick your ingredients although sometimes they run out i love the sweet potato option which puts a unique twist on the truck very cheap compared to other burrito options around university city its conveniently located on the strip of spruce food trucks and overall just a decent burritothis store carries many items that cant be found anywhere else but their pricing fluctuates so much i buy cases of coconut cream there and the price is never the same last time i was charged 38 today i was charged 48 this has happened many times in the past they do have great prices on produce but the random pricing of items can be frustratingi really really wanted to love dd especially because theyre the only place in town to offer kolaches   ive had dd about five times ive had sliders donuts a breakfast taco kolaches and a breakfast biscuit   the sliders were okay nothing was wrong with them per se but i found them to be very average with all of the rave around this establishment i was braced to have my socks knocked off but socks were not knocked   the donuts their main selling point are far below average yes they have some fancy concoctions however they taste like a stale 3 day old donut from your offices break room i feel like the novelty of the flavors are meant to make up for the mediocrity of the actual donut   as a texan ill admit i have some high expectations for my tacos dd tortillas were extremely bland and bathed in butter i couldnt eat more than three or four bites   the kolaches are okay again as a texan i have high expectations the kolaches are probably the best thing ive had at dd theyre not award winning material but they get the job done   the biscuit okay yall flat and dense i dont even know how that happens   overall dd is a unique experience with some unique items but the novelty far out shadows the actual flavor of the foodnothing fancy the place can lean towards dirty but prices are great and they often carry things other places dont   as they say price sellsfirst let me say the location is amazing therefore 3 stars however the food is not really good we had a lobster soup which tasted like instant tomatoe soup and a uni which was okay  not aure if i would go again for lunch here or just stay here and enjoy the viewi pass by here almost monthly in the morning and just stop for breakfast  so since breakfast is served fast and you are out of there in 30 minutes or less my review will be just as fast  coffee a little bitter2 stars omelets huge piping hot very good  4 stars home fries inconsistent some burnt some pale and almost raw  2 stars bacon 3 slices more like jerky  2 stars service attentive friendly  4 stars prices reasonable  3 starsthis place has gone downhill it is such a shame because my boyfriend and i were looking forward to some authentic mexican food within the downtown area we have been here a few times and the initial visits were really promising they had a few things to work out from a service perspective but i felt the food was on par and very fresh since those initial visits my experience here has not been favorable it seems that the operations of this place has some constraints which has now impacted the food quality they have completely dumb down their menu the mole dish is gone the pescado was not printed on the menu but the server said it was still available although it did not taste like the original the tacos were lacking flavor we tried the carne chicken and ground beef tacos and felt the meat was lacking seasoning we did enjoy the salsa verde which accompanied the tacos and added some much needed flavor when i asked the server what was going on she mentioned that they were transitioning menus this seems to be the theme of this place specifically since they had a closure and reopening within the course of this year oh and i must mention that on a prior occasion we were turned away because apparently the kitchen had crashed i wish they would have stayed true to their original concept and worked on the service and their cocktail program which needs an overhaul unfortunately i do not think they will lastloved the poke bowls in cali so wanted to try one local to my area this one is a little hole in the wall where you order in a drivethru i built my own bowl with brown rice shrimp salmon pineapple ginger scallions sesame and spicy poke sauce overall it wasnt bad not up to par with my experience at poke bowl places in cali but still pretty good i would go backhad the turkey wrap which was a bit dry fries were cold service was quick and pleasant ok experience  other people in my party enjoyed their foodgreat digs renovated train depot a bit sketchy side of reno we went for lunch and ran into the mob across the street lined up for food  the mens bathroom is cool hubby snapped a photo of the bank vault door for me to see i was excited for the food but it was ok not knock your socks off beer flight when we went were largely ipas we like the darks stuff but did get two flights to try mehvisited asian harbor on a friday evening the place was about half full and we were seated immediately i really liked the modern decoration but was a little surprised to hear a rihanna cd blaring through our dinner i ordered the bourbon chicken and my fiance ordered the beef and broccoli both dishes arrived in under 10 minutes and were okay but pretty chewy i also tried the wonton soup which was good service was prompt but our waters went without refills overall experience mehbeer  45 food 35 service 3  will return because the food and beer were good but the waitress we had was subpar  they seemed understaffed for some reason saturday afternoon so maybe that was the reason for the poor service   we ordered the chips and guac appetizer pretty solid  the chips were homemade and the guac and salsa were on the money only complaint would be the use of parsley in lieu of cilantro in the salsa overall though we were pleased   our lunch consisted of the carnitas and carne asada tacos the former were far better mango salsa should be saved for fish tacos not carne asada not bad but not great   for beer we had the hop hands apa the house staple im sad porter smooth and dangerous peridot jasmine ipa cellophane thin tropical ipa and technicolor splendor iipa  all were very good and distinct  tech splendor was the favorite of the day  the setting was great and the atmosphere was fun my only hope is that the folks at tired hands dont get any more pretentious as their brand growsmet our fearless new cm brett here at a lunch break he was right about the hummus fo sho i had a hofbruhaus draft from munich and it was most righteous its what i would call a hole in a wall cept made from a gas station that has the potential depending on the party you bring 5 of us yelpers made it and we had a most enlightening bs session id do it again i alos saw potential on the menu of healthy sammies too way to break up the day brett lets do it again soonvery sorry to make this comments im a very typical taiwanese guy and very easy on food also very know well of taiwanese cooking  the resturant is very unigue people there is very friendly  helpful thats why i gave 3 stars for the place  personnel but 0 for the food  basically noting wrong but the food  i was very exciting to find this place but once i try the food tonight i wont go back to the resturant again but for the people dont know any things about taiwanese cooking it maybe ok all the traditional taiwanese dishes i order nothing is what i expected we only finished 35 of our food  it just my personal opinion expensive but the food is not the best the area is very clean though and the service nice i think that if i was going to have a salad then it shouldnt cost what it does here the hummus is all right thocold stone is decent ice cream but i dont think its better enough than the nearby competition to justify their pricesid actually give this place 35 stars if i could the food is good however im not a big pastry eater so all ive had is their breakfast and lunch sandwiches and coffee all three are good but i wish they had more options in the lunch sandwich dept i should probably give them 4 stars for having the sand to open up in channelside i am very grateful for that as i live there and the area is in great need of additional restaurants all of the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere of the place is great its my local goto breakfast jointpretty fast service even during a very busy day and decently clean  unfortunately due to starbucks regulations when i asked to try one of the teas they couldnt give me a sample but hey i guess with a chain we cant be too picky they could have been a little bit more informed on the coffee and tea choices when my boyfriend asked one of the baristas which of their coffees has the most bold flavor she answered sorry i dont know that answer i dont drink coffee hmmm what how are you a barista with no opinion in coffee because you dont drink it ouch that was not a good thing my boyfriend eventually got a coffee that was not nearly as strong as hopedim not usually a marsh shopper as i find their prices higher than my main store kroger that being said i found an amazing deal on pizzas and 2 liters of soda two pizzas two sodas for 1050even little caesars cant beat that you win my vote on this day marshanyone who walks into an ajs should know they arent walking out without taking a significant hit to the wallet but even with that said i think there is a bit of buyer beware to be mindful of here  my wife and i stopped here to check out their specialty selections and found it to be a very mixed bag  the sushi bar was an excellent find love the dragon roll but the bistro was a total disappointment  their website said fivestar quality and while of course that was a bit of an exaggeration the selection of hot entrees we found didnt even approach twostar quality level    on the plus side though the dessert and coffee bar was outstanding  the selection is simply amazing from chocolates to pastries to fruits coffee tea hot cocoa you name it  we should have just stuck to sushi and dessert  those were definitely the highlights  as a grocery store i would only see myself shopping here to take advantage of their butcher and seafood selections  there were some cuts and items here that you simply cant find at your typical grocery store  but outside of that youre just paying for marked up cheerios    so if you stick to those specialties ajs does well you will feel like you got your moneys worthargh  i want so much to like the food in this cool little place but it just aint working for me  the fruit smoothies are not to thick and taste like fresh fruity goodness  the price is right too  the people who work there that ive encountered have been superduper nice  like really nice not just smile for the camera nice  i somehow ended up ordering a supersize mixitallup platter   it came with lots of food and even subbed in something for something else  my problem was that the pita bread was so tough it was almost inedible  it made it hard to scoop the other components  left in the warmer to long  although there was a lot of food a large part of it was greek salad  i would have liked more hummus and tabbouleh which were good  at 1899 less salad and more substance  i am sure that they would be accommodating if askedi am right in the middle of the road here the parking lot is ample they are closed on sundays and mondays i would think they would do a lot of business on sundays but i am not a business owner there is outdoor seating on the front porch walking in the hostess stand is immediately to your right the bar is to the left and the dining room is on your right they do evidently have poker machines in an enclosed room everything is neat and clean if a bit dark the restrooms are neat clean and well stocked  last night i had their special which was the seafood lasagne layers of cheese noodles shrimp crawfish clams and yummyness that when i couldnt finish it reheated nicely for lunch today the rest of the food is just ok you can expect the same at any other chain restaurant which they are not a chain but it is just the same they have no sweet tea but depending on the waitress they will add simple syrup though not all of the wait staff will pieces of room temperature bread will be served with your meal with butter that you can add but its not warm enough to melt the butter and does not seem to be homemade  i will continue to be an occasional patron but it isnt going to be a regular visit for mefirst impressions walking into baileys range were good we were greeted by a single table stretching the length of the lower floor running alongside the open kitchen i liked the thriftstore chic look of the dcor  old windows hanging from the ceiling mason jars for water glasses milk jug lanterns for lighting its also nice that the entire kitchen is open for the diners to see   i was happy to see their large varied draft selection and thrilled when i realized that all but a single guest tap are beers from st louis breweries i was less thrilled to see the prices  5 or 7 dollars for a pint seems steep even for the high quality beers available my party stuck to the mixed drinks which come in three varieties boozy lemonade boozy milkshakes and icepicks my strawberry basil lemonade was good if a bit light on the basil flavor but the star of the evening was the sweet sweet bacon perhaps the most indulgent item i have ever seen on a menu this milkshake contains bourbon salted caramel ice cream and candied bacon it tasted as amazing as it sounds and it definitely earned the boozy title  i ordered the buzzed burger a beef patty rubbed in espresso topped with onion bacon blue cheese and apple i asked for it medium but it came welldone though i was the only one at my table to whom this happened the burger itself was a bit disappointing the bold flavors seemed to fight rather than complement each other the blue cheese being the worst offender i tried my friends lgbt a beef patty topped with arugula goat cheese bacon and tomato and found it to be far superior we also got an abc with apples bacon and camembert which was excellent all of the burgers came with ketchup though i cant imagine anyone actually putting any on these elaborately topped burgers special note goes to the dill pickles served on the side  theyre housemade and delicious  none of the burgers came with fries so we ordered a large order that came with two side sauces the number of sauces available is impressive i plan to return just to try some of the other ones we got the rooster sauce pretty good and the crazy catsup excellent the fries themselves were tasty but had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a while this surprised me especially given the atmosphere of fresh honest cooking given by the open kitchen  the service was some of the best ive experienced in a while our server was attentive knowledgeable and friendly when my friend asked her to recommend a dessert she immediately ran and fetched a sample of the salted caramel ice cream which is made in house all of the wait staff seemed to be having a good time which was a refreshing change from the surly servers one often sees in burger joints  overall i liked baileys range the shakes atmosphere and dcor were all excellent if they fix their execution problems overcooked burger stale fries and lower the price on their beer they could easily get bumped up to 45 starshad the pancakes and were honestly not too impressed almost tasted a bit raw my friend had the shrimp and grits and the sauce for that was very tasty wouldnt return here but wasnt too bad eithermehnothing too special it was oki really wanted to love this place but between their odd hours and just ok coffee it doesnt hit the mark for me if i am going to buy coffee on the go i want it to be amazing so i dont have to think about how much cheaper it would have been if i had just made it at home ha and this place just doesnt do it for me maybe i need to try some different drinks other than just a cafe mocha or whatever it is called it is on the way home from work so i will give it another chance and hopefully this review will change the drive through option is really nice i will say thatbit of a mixed bag the coffee was good and the service was friendly but they totally forgot about my coffee and i had to remind them about it 10 minutes later also pretty damn slow in general taking orders   on the plus side the lady did punch my loyalty card twice as way of apology would be far more awesome if i actually lived in nashvillethe food is always great its a place that my whole family likes and that is a bonus the staff on the other hand are not so great ordering in the drive thru is a joke they person on the other end can never hear you correctly it seems as though most of the staff doesnt speak english very well and they get mad at you when they dont understand you my order always has to be corrected at the window and it usually takes more than one person to fix itwent back again to have the vegan french toast and this time it was totally different i honestly think they forgot to dip it in batter and fry it it was like warm cinnamon bread with powder sugar on top the waitress was not very friendly at all either the silverware was put in a mason jar on the table and was still wet from the wash  hopefully it was just a bad sunday csuse we need more vegan restraunts in renoi really wanted some shrimp and grits for brunch and found this hole in the wall spot from my experience those places are usually the best it was fairly crowded but we were seated pretty quickly however they quickly forgot about us as well nonetheless i ordered my shrimp and grits and was very disappointed the sauce on top of the grits was a huge letdown the flavors were terrible mixed with the shrimp and cheese grits it tasted as if the sauce was spoiled way to lemony it would probably pair well with grilled chicken and pasta but not on cheesy grits and shrimp it would have been great if they eliminated the sauce this was definitely not a win when im back in nola ive got to try somewhere elseafter waiting days to go because of the ridiculously long line over a block long it was finally a delicious meal i was able to enjoy however service was so cold and inhospitable almost keeps me from returning again but the waffle i ate was just too deliciousi was very excited to find a taiwanese place that also served milk tea in reno being in the bay area has certainly spoiled me and my milk tea craze there are so many different places to choose from   they are nice people overall their food is just okay i do love their daily soups they are some legit chinese soups which i simply adore and cannot get enough of their zha jiang mien tasted like taiwanese spaghetti which they do advertise as in fine print their popcorn chicken tastes like every other popcorn chicken out there so it was satisfying   they only serve black milk teas which was a little bit disappointing to me since i prefer jasmine green milk tea   overall 3 stars just because theres no other milk tea place in reno would i come back yea i guess its nice that they have a checkin discount offer thoughi wish i could always give taco bell five stars this taco bell has pros and cons theres a really friendly guy on the drive thru speaker youll know it if you get him  food is great because taco bell downsides are i cant sit inside in this one because there is always this beeping that makes me want to throw things  in addition they are missing and item from our drive thru pretty regularly so make sure you check before you goi got the 1 and the burger was ok i personally dont think it had a lot of flavor i think the fries were just ok too i honestly prob would rather get in and outthis place is very cute and very clean with good coffee the staff is very nice but ive been here three times recently and they are consistently very slow even when i am the only one in the whole shop they also have been consistently out of things and asked me if id mind if they gave me a different drink or a different milk after i have already paid i will continue to come back for convenience but id love to see service get a bit betteri like the ice cream here bc its really creative and pretty good but what really put me off was the smell it might just be me but i dont know it smells kind of dingy to me but it looks very clean so i was confused other than that this place is cute and i like the flavor options they havegeneral tsos chicken is pretty good but the crab rangoon is barely edible for the price i would expect just a little bit better qualityfood is good not great we ordered the lamb which cost 15 we expected a plate of food instead we paid 15 for a tray 34 full of french fries and two slices of lamb no salad nothing else in total we spent 40 on two dishes and a salad we were just looking for some quick greek food honestly like what you would find in a food court and this is not the place for itlike crown liquors and this is one of the better location great prices and specials will return again the selection of vodka always seems on pointfoods good texmex margis  are nice and strong just dont go if you are in a hurry service is rather badi wish their were half stars as i would rate this place a 35 stars   the first thing to note about this place is the decor outside it looks like a mexican shack but once you walk in it is wonderfully decorated just a note if the front parking lot is full they have a lot in back once inside we were seated immediately they seated us at the communal high top tables in the bar area the first thing we noticed was how loud it was it was hard to have a conversation without speaking quite loudly once our server arrived we had a hard time hearing her she was quite friendly she dropped off chips and salsa and we ordered some guacamole both were very tasty i ordered the wet burrito with chicken and green sauce and my girlfriend ordered the veggie enchiladas  the food came out very quickly less than 10 minutes the place was fairly full on a friday night the food was dropped off but we had no silverware or napkins once we received our silverware we dug in   the food was very flavorful the burrito had a nice mix of chicken beans veggies and rice my girlfriends veggie enchiladas looked tasty but she said they were a bit dry and lacked the sauce they needed  overall we felt the food was decent bit not outstanding  while we didnt have a bad experience we didnt have the best experience  i enjoyed my meal and look forward to trying something else the next time we can visiti dont think i got a very fair representation of sparkles we came around 2 oclock and there were only two flavors of cupcakes left there was a plain chocolate and a plain vanilla they were not the best cupcakes i have ever had they were a little dry but still far better than gigis i cannot stand an over abundance of frosting and sparkles cupcakes have just the right amount  the customer service was great and definately gets 5 stars we will have to try back another day when the cupcakes are fresh and fully stocked they do things right when it comes to convenience and that is the biggest reason i go to toppers  their website is fast and userfriendly they open earlier and close later than any pizza place nearby they have frequent deals etc  the pizza is also pretty solid and a good price id put it above donatos dominos or phut but below any locally owned place in terms of qualitykinda miss the days when the baldwins ran the place our pancakes did not have that fresh taste and flavor  the omelet was ok  service was still good but when i walked out i just didnt feel like it was what it used to be we said to ourselves waffle house might have been a better alternative if youre looking for breakfast if the line is too long think about itcracker barrel must be the mcdonalds of comfort food chains theyve got pancakes waffles fried chicken and waffles shrimp grits steak fish dumplings mac n cheese chicken pot pie etc i have never had a bad meal at any of the restaurants i didnt say they were healthy they are far from healthy but they are delicious so if you are into the health and fitness lifestyle turn around get back in your car and drive somewhere else you do not want to eat here  breakfast comes with a basket of biscuits and corn muffins as a starter boy are they good fresh out of the oven and toasty warm todays or rather yesterdays plate du jour was the old timers breakfast two eggs any style turkey bacon grits and gravy yum  cracker barrel is not only a restaurant its an old fashioned general store where you can get just about anything except car parts they sell candy games toys clothes kitchen wares home decorations cards books cds jewelry etc  the decor looks like you are stepping into a hoarders farmhouse complete with a fire place yes every single cracker barrel i have stepped into is designed with the exact same layout you walk into what you think is the restaurant only to give your name and number in party where you are put on a waiting list well played cracker barrel then you must wander the general store until you are tempted to open the trunk of your vehicle and pack the 4 rocking chairs youve just purchased once your name is called you follow the host to your seat past the big burning fire place the checker board tables and the other dinersyou are given a small chinese checker game to occupy yourselves until your food comes  the place is always busy and the menu is huge one for breakfastone for lunch  dinner so my suggestion is that you peruse those while waiting for your name to be calledthese fries were amazing crusted in parmesan and truffle oil side of aioli the service was quick only had to wait a few minutes the options werent as customizable as i would have liked i wanted light toppings on the fries looks like they only went easy on the aioli but there arent that many items and additives to addremove to begin with their simplicity is their strength as every edible part of the sandwiches is packed with bold flavorstopped in here for lunch while completing my sandwich tour of nashville via thecitypaper and tried the italian sausage stuffed pretzel  i was very excited for this sandwich and the uniqueness of using a pretzel as a bun  however i was disappointed with the taste and overall presentation of the meal  for starters the pretzel dude at the amusement park can make a better pretzel thats warm moist slight crisp and of course that delicious salt  the pretzel here fell short as soggy and flavorless  the cheese seemed to have been sitting on the burger as well  still with all this the sandwich was ok yes just ok  the waitstaff was very friendly and even gave obliged on 12 price beers when there werent any a waitress informed us there was 2 for 1s even though there werent  but the manager still helped us out  the atmosphere was decent as well with a nice patio  the beer selection is just ok as well  for a beer garden id expect them to have more    given all the wonderful reviews of this place i may just have to give it a second chancethis was actually a taco bell and pizza hut express i got tacos but wife wanted bread sticks so it all worked out  the 2 meal deals are radically different prices everywhere we go and this place was no exception charging 279 they did come with a large drink though i wonder if thats all they had left as everyone seemed to be getting one i would much rather pay less and have to walk up to get refills oh well   my burrito was all right nothing special but not bad my wifes pizza was about the same the bread sticks were worth the trip though so all is wella decent escape but not enough to occupy for long  we were only there for about two hours but when we left i felt like i bathed in a giant ashtray filled with cheap cigarettes and stale beer  patrons of all walks of life all shapes and sizes  not unlike vegas its a peoplewatchers dream    there are several styles of new machines including a video blackjack with a live recorded dealer and a heavilycomputerized roulette and craps set up  urban legends say casinos pump oxygen through their air vents to keep people awake longer and spending more  hard rock doesnt even need to because there are so many people there who carry their own toting their oxygen tank in one hand and a lit smoke in the other   there are several rooms of games and it seems like the slots go on forever  a lot of the slot machines dont let you choose the lines you want to play you just have to play max lines all the time so beware of those if youre not the fullbore kind of gambler  did notice the food court sporting some good food and some reasonable prices  less than 10 for a burgerfries combo so thats a plus  didnt dine there though the smoke was so heavy all i wanted to do was leave  showered that night woke up the next morning and i could still smell it in the hotel and in the cari was expecting a bit more from this restaurant as i am a fan of the bailey restaurants the decor was good and our waiter was nice bringing a few beers for my guests to taste without our even asking i was with two friends from spain  one ordered a salad which she said was good the second ordered the ozark burger which looked good and was tasty she said i ordered the turkey burger which was fairly small and on the dry side i dont eat beef so order turkey burgers whenever possible they do not have to be dry i promise  try the one at harry  izzys in indianapolis and you will taste the difference  in addition my fries were stonecold no excuse when the restaurant is virtually empty we came in on the late side of lunch after visiting a museum there were maybe 6 tables total that were occupied  so no excuse for cold fries  a restaurant of this caliber should not be scraping together the left over fries to serve to a customer  our waiter was quick to replace them when i flagged him down but  by the time my hot fries came out i was already more than halfway done my meal which was disappointing sorry we didnt try the boozy shakesfirst of all i would like to say that i adore the idea of this shop and the decor of the outsidebut when you step inside it is not really consumer friendly or spaced so you can look around you are in a tiny space trying to decide what cupcake you want while the employeeowner is right there trying to have you decideso not your typical cupcake or baker display case and the website doesnt prepare you for thisthere are only a few flavors everyday so you  would have to preorder or call ahead to see if they have what you want    i enjoyed the flavor of the cupcakes i had and the decorations are topnotch oh so cute so i would go there again but wish it were a little more on the inviting and comfortable side to go in and be a consumeri got the impression they just want to cater to special orders and industry people   yes the cupcakes are pricey but they are special and as i said previously decorated above and beyond so i think you would be hard pressed to find a cupcake that is as precious as these onesi still stand by my original review but for purely the professional response i will give it a 3 star i will add that the presentation is very nice but the taste still is average in my books could be better but is solid given their effortchili chicken salad was really good but ordering is a pain we ordered directly from staff that area is noisy and i couldnt hear the gals voice  i asked her to speak up but she didnt   i was asked what type of bread i wanted and i said i didnt want any bread turns out i could have had an apple i heard this when my sister was ordering and asked her cashier if i could get a cut apple since i didnt know that i there was a choice her cashier asked if my sister wanted to pay for it she said no why isnt that free with her meal she finally figured that out the apple arrived at my table uncut  tables are usually dirty when i get there saturday was no exception  staff near the quick pickup window were yelling and laughing at each other rather disruptive while we were eating  food is really good here the staff and cleanliness could be improved thowent with a buddy for 35 cent wing night definitely made the right choice the wings were delicious and only paying 350 for ten of em made my day for being 6pm on a monday the place was pretty empty just the usual bar crowd hanging about didnt bother me just thought itd be way more packed for 35 cent wings the only reason for the 3 star is that it wasnt anything really memorable the staff was really laid back and the building was just typical i havent tried any food other than the wings but if your lookin for some wings on the cheap get here i really want to test out wing deliverythe dishes were a bit salty for my taste the drinks on the other hand are definitely the forte of this place loved the ambience and laid back atmosphereexpensive mediocre food ham swiss spinach sandwich was okay but wouldnt bother coming here againlets try this one more again came to get my complimentary meal due to a complaint over the weekend 30 minute wait for wings after an initial 6 mins wait was what was told to me that was to include complimentary apple pies which i never received i appreciate the general manager taking the time to make up the horrible experience of waiting a long period for hot and fresh food i shall enjoy my free foodso i do like pretty sweet drinks and i like cider and usually meads however the mead here is a little sweet and syrup like for me i think that if they had a few more options that it would be better the wine varieties were the best in my opinion they tasted very similar to grape juice the strawberry pbj wasnt anyone in my groups favorite i think this place is nice to go for a drink with a date but overall i think they need more offerings to make me stayi am new to the area been working on cleaning and unpacking  decided coffee and donuts were needed for breakfast and stopped here for breakfast yesterday morning the place was packed the hustle and bustle of morning rush but the young lady at the counter was on the ball and patient with my indecision  even offered m a dozen card so when i get it all punched i can get a free dozen   the donuts were a wonderfully delightful experience on my tongue will not be long till i get that card filled i am sure   did i mention i am in the process of unpacking and moving here  good i will tell you i was impressed enough with this place at 7 am in the morning with how fast and efficient that after a hard day of unloading a 26 ft moving truck lifting furniture into place i decided at 9 pm to try this places other half    the diner   we walked in found a table as there was quite a few open   waitress 1 walked by  i will be with you in a moment   5 minutes later waitress 2 said i will be with you in just a second  did i mention that there were not that many tables filled the counter was completely open   several minutes passed  waitress 3 stops and says do you need menus and has your drink order been taken  still more minutes pass  waitress 4 brings us menus and asks what we would like to drink  still more minutes tick past and our beverages arrive  we place our order and the waitress disappears   now after a long hard day of work and finally getting to sit down and relax i drank my ice cold sweet tea half down in just a few sips  and i started watching the show  waitresses running here and there with no real organization  did not appear to the observant eye that there was any real logic to their madness   i have worked food service and customer service for over 3 decades  i have received awards from major national corporations on customer service  i admit i am hyper critical of customer service and its lack there of   i know this is a family owned establishment as my husband and i never eat at chain restaurants   we were excited to see if this would be our late night go to place    after about 20 minutes our food arrived our drinks were basically water from ice melting  our food was placed in front of us and no refill was offered  the sandwiches were good the fries were luke warm and our glasses were empty    the only sign of our waitress was from across the room and she was not making eye contact none of the first 3 waitresses approached us they were too busy with the other 4 or 5 tables counter was still empty    after we finished eating i was commenting to my husband about the lack of assigned stations  that management needed to divide the room up into areas so that the wait staff was not running over each other   the waitress we had came by asked if we needed anything else  we were done ready to leave only wanting our check  then two of the other waitresses came by to see if we wanted to go boxes or a refill   i wasnt vocal in my critic of the staff or the place i wasnt rude  i just was having a quiet conversation  i am not sure if it was overheard but i was not impressed that for over an hour and 20 minutes in an establishment that had gotten such rave reviews we were basically ignored on an evening and time that was not to all appearances busy   the total bill was 21 dollars  i left 25 percent tip only in the hopes that the waitress will recognize us next time if we come in and work a little harder for the tip  i usually tip 30 percent  and 50 percent for outstanding customer service   and as the only mom and pop type place open 24 hours a day we will most likely be back even if it is just for the donutsthis is the closest grocery to where we are staying it seems to have just about everything we need but not quite the store is clean well stocked and friendly customer service  my experience i use this store for the staples or if i need to pick up 1 or 2 itemsit has been awhile since i last been here they are now charging 10 to park in the parking garage  the parking lot that used to be in front of the casino is now under construction  its going to be awhile before i come back heregot in line opening day to take advantage of the buy one get one free burgers with free fries loved how they let you choose your temp for the burger and the homemade buns were light and tasty the burger patty was delicious and juicy with a nice meaty slice of tomato and fresh lettuce the fries were crispy and well seasoned i was a little dissapointed with the milkshake not quite as thick and chocolatey as i would have liked and for 5 i wanted a little more overall i was pleased with my meal but might not order a shake next timepretty basic food the place itself is basic looking i didnt find anything differentiating about this diner and its food  if you are looking for a quick bite for breakfast its fine for that but nothing special about itnot bad pretty good for fast food and nice mango chicken salad i would prefer a vinaigrette over the creamy cilantro dressing really needs extra mango ask for extra mango if you order this salad check to see if there is a vinaigrette because the creamy dressing masked the other flavors in the saladwe were really excited about trying out baileys range during a trip to st louis based on the reviews photos and eclectic menu  we arrived around 6 pm on a sunday evening to a full restaurant but were seated upstairs where you have a full view of the kitchen the restaurant was very warm which surprised me but the patrons seemed happylots of families with children and couples in their 20s30s  we waited quite awhile for our server to show and were eventually taken care of by an employee who wasnt our server because wed waited so long we knew everything we wanted to order my wife has a gluten sensitivity so thankfully they were able to provide a bun for her their boozy milkshakes were delicious but the rest of the food was just okay we started with the house chips which came to us cold i asked our server if they normally came like that and he said yes this surprised me as most locations with house chips serve them fresh from the fryer i think they wouldve been better if they were warmbut we were so hungry that we had no problem finishing them  the burgers are quite small for what you pay but with the beef being grass fed and local i could see why neither my wife or i were blown away by the burger but ive never met a burger i didnt like so it did the job the fries are quite good and come with your choice of two housemade sauces i thought the horsey sauce was very good but didnt care for the others  if youre in the downtown stl area and looking for a good bite id recommend this for most but if youre looking for a larger burger you might want to look elsewhere all in all the food was good but seemed pricey for what we receivedsooooooooul food  i went with a few friends to yummies today for lunch  when we arrived we were the only people in the joint  we were greeted by an overly energetic server and hostess who pointed out that all the food was on display in the case  we were invited to sit anywhere we liked and informed that we could order from the menu or from the case  i ordered the fried pork chop the macaroni and the greens  i agree with previous reviews that the greens were cooked with way too much vinegar for my liking  the pork chop was tasty as was the mac and cheese    service was a little casual and slow on this visit  while our food was already cooked it took roughly ten minutes for it to be served  take away orders seemed to be served faster than dine in customers  yummies does not accept credit or debit cards even though they have the stickers indicating they do posted on their cash register  on this visit the establishment didnt even have cash to make change  we scrounged to come up with enough change to pay for the soda i ordered  if you visit yummies website prior to your visit you could receive a coupon for a free meal just by joining ningcom  be warned that it may take a day or two to receive an email with the coupon  httpwwwyummiesrestaurantcomaboutusspecials  all in all the food was good but the establishment was pretty quieti like creole creamery but not nearly as much as it appears every one else does any place that lets me sample as many flavors as i want before ordering scores major points in my books and i like the classic ice cream shop feel but while the ice cream is certainly good i dont think its the best ive ever had it is the best ive found so far in new orleans though so that counts for something sometimes parking is a little tricky in the neighborhood but a long walk to and from my car only justifies that extra scoop i inevitably always order righta nice bar to catch up with a few friends over a quality beer beer aside  my partner really enjoyed her pretzel and i am hearing from others that they also have enjoyed their pretzels i ordered what the menu describes as tomato confit bruschetta i personally was not overly fussed on this particular dish  pros boutique beers nice atmosphere friendly staff cool people attend the german sausages on the menu look nice but i have not tried them they had a special deal the night i went on selected mixed spirit drinks served in pewter mugs which was a really nice twist caring management who care about their customers  cons  not to much to say here the only thing i can say is that the village pub  beer garden has limited food menu options but i do understand they are a pub and not a restaurant as suchthe service is very fast some times too fast and my fries are not always cooked very well i have to have fries that are cook all the way but all in all the place is legithate love thing on this chain sometimes good some time irrr  todays visit was kinda stressful the server kinda mumbled his way through kept having to repeat things  they also were behind on refreshing choicespetit piquant was oh so disappointing i loved the cold case with all the pretty pastries and cakes they dont have that now maybe later i felt like what they have was very minimal they do have breakfast sandwiches and other sandwiches but i came for a sweet treat  i ordered two nutella croissants one for me and one for my hubby the only thing that made them look fascinating was the over the top powdered sugar  when i tried it it was lackluster kinda hard and quite lacking in nutella was that nutella or some slight chocolate feeling either way it wasnt worth it   they are new in this spot as petit piquant perhaps there will be more to come in the futuregood if you have a craving but not my favorite boba place in town the bobas seemed smaller than what i normally see but the texture was good not as much flavor but decent enough service was slow but my order was accurate seems like a fun place to hang outi came back again on a cold tuesday for lunch there was two other tables eating lunch at the time the hostess was nowhere to be seen after waiting couple of minutes we eventually decided to sit ourselves and hope that someone would come the waitress finally showed up we ordered pizza and a whipped ricotta   my boyfriend loved the pizza per usual its amazing that it was 18 dollars which is a tad bit absurd i love the whipped ricotta i bring my own gluten free cracker and it ends up being a delicious fatty gluten free meal for me  i was frustrated again my the lack of service we both had empty water she came by and we asked for water we were finished 15 odd minutes later before she brought the water the check was another service battle she brought the check and after another 10 minutes of not returning for the card i went into the kitchen area to find here  it wasnt a busy day so i am confused by the lack of service if you are buying gourmet pizzas and higher end drink i would expect a different level of service maybe it was just an off day but i was disappointed because this didnt match my previous experiencesif i could rate the brewery and the restaurant separately i would beer is excellent worthy of a 5 star review the food however is a 1 star at best i stopped here for lunch with a friend and both of our meals were inedible the waiter was terrible too im glad they use all locally grown ingredients in the restaurant but they need to hire decent chefs  the brewery is super cool and i went to the beer school which was so much fun and highly educationalsurprisingly cheap go here when youre short of money and need to fill a grocery cart for about 110 on a good day the pizza isnt bad the bakery is tolerable the baked chicken can be good hey its a lot of name brand food sold much cheaper than other supermarkets nothing at all wrong with the placeclean and efficient you bag yourselfsaves costs   theres a cheese i like that goes for around 1012 at area grocery stores but here its 6  and a great wash state wine that is 799 at discount wine houses went for 6 here  theyre getting my attention  funny last week at scolaris a customer was bagging his own groceries and joking about it and an employee joked back that they didnt have winco prices  no credit cards so bewarethis place is pretty good but nothing too special theres always a long wait because its a hip spot but you could go down the street for the same meal without the waitthe food was very good big portions prices according to what you are eating fast service going againthe food is okay great for a quick stop not not earth shattering i mean its fast food with a tropical twist  their cilantrogarlic dipping sauce is awesome thoughreally good ice cream store was very dirty unfortunately old ice cream spilled all over counters and a little pricey could be five stars with a little cleaning and decor could use a little updatingthe beer selection is good however they dont offer flights to sample them all bar staff is less than friendly if you dont already know what you wpretty bland pizza its just missing something maybe more sauce would help or more cheese im not sure the workers were really friendly but im going to keep trying other pizza places until i find my favorite this definitely isnt itthe place is cute but small and noisy the coffee machines are loud if you sit in the front im sure its more quiet in the back i had an iced latte the drink was pretty good the service was mediocre thoughi felt like i was intruding the barista for asking a question about their drink menuok im mildly embarrassed to be writing this review but all my cards on the table sometimes when the going gets tough i go to dairy queen and the fact that this location  1 is open till 10pm 2 takes credit for 250 3 has smiling happy people every time ive been dont judge me  is enough to make me get on yelp pull up a chain a chain whos soft serve certainly isnt the best in town to write a review i wish we had a bunny hutch a la lincolnwood il old stomping grounds but until then a mini pecan cluster blizzard is going to have to do and this place does the trickfirst time visiting this place and while i was not blown away by their food i gotta say that the staff was very friendly so it made up for it some  took my son for dinner and we both ordered burgers medium rare for me and medium for him they tasted fine but were overcooked  as i mentioned before this was my first visit so i will give them another tryive been searching for the best coffee in franklin so i gave high brow a try  love the facility decor and location simple brewed coffee was fine the nutella pop tart was amazing and must have been hand crafted  staff was efficient but not overly friendly i will definitely returni had the opportunity to try kachi at the south street night market on 815 it was on my lets try list  for the evening based on the brief description on the night market website and i happened to stumble on it at the right time well not the right time because i waited for over an hour but i was hungry and the menu was intriguing   since i knew i didnt have the time to hit up another truck i decided to try two of the menu items and went for the bulgogi taco and the fried kimchi rice balls i added the pineapple habanero sauce and gochujang to both lets start with the taco it came with the beef and the red cabbage slaw even with the two sauces for whatever reason the flavors just didnt mesh to me towards the end a piece of the bulgogi did fall out and i sampled it by itself it was a tasty little piece of meat i think i would have been happy with a chunk of that and some of the pineapple habanero sauce as forewarned both sauces did have a nice little kick to them the rice balls were just okay i was expecting them have a little more flavor on their own but they were fairly bland i could kind of taste the cheese but i was expecting a little more of a meltiness to the dish that just wasnt there im not sure what kind of cheese it wasmaybe it wasnt supposed to get melty i added a little extra of the pineapple sauce and i enjoyed it a little more the kimchi rice balls came with two balls and the the taco was one per order for the 8 i paid i think the proportions were appropriate   im glad i waited for it however it wasnt necessarily worth the wait i would eat there again sans the long line however i dont love it enough to dedicate another hour or so of my lifethe food was good but their world famous margaritas not so much i couldve had a better margarita from a premixed bottle  the state store that was disappointing  service was goodi liked the seafood gumbo but it wasnt anything crazy different or spectacular the grand isle salad with chicken was massive in size which was great because all ingredients were nice and fresh and the dressing was wonderful bleu cheese   this is a great lunch spot if you want some predictable but still yummy and filling food thats a good value for the cost but not a place for a foody looking for something exciting and different in new orleanspretty good on the other hand i am totally unconvinced there is any kind of home cooking going on here which is implied in a really circumspect and roundabout way when i mildly pressed the owners about recipes and ingredients i got an odd mixture of sales pitch and something about the food actually coming from india judging from that i think a very good part of what they offer are the kinds of heat and serve or quickprep prepackaged indian dishes you can get at an indopak grocery or even trader joes really its a great idea for what it is kind of like a hindukush flavored skyline chili but this is really and truly fast foodinsanely long wait for a sunday brunch and once we finally got seated it took forever for someone to come take our order they seem disorganized and inefficient i was pretty grumpy by the time we ordered    5 star dish beef wrapped pancake  4 star dish pork wrapped pancake  not as good as beef version pork ribs noodle soup  sorta like curry but not as intensely flavored  3 star dish half beeftendon noodle soup  beef good tendon delicious but noodles lacked flavor   2 star dish braised pork with rice  bland mostly rice crispy fish filet burger  bland needed some kind of sauce pork curry over rice  not the kinda curry im used to pork seemed overdone mango smoothie  way too sweet   thumbs up for authentic flavors thumbs way down for the crazy wait and disorganizationsome of the other reviewers are out to lunch this place does not pack their donairs with meat  if anything their donairs are on the small side  an average man with an average appetite would have to order a supersized donair to be satisfied  that means their donairs are not big  not only that theyre not even of average size  other than that the proprietor is a lovely fella and the dining room is clean enough  this is an average donair place worth checking out if youre in the area and youd like a donairok for a chain it isnt bad a solid choice for a casual meal this new location opened up near to us so the allure of unlimited french fries with your entree was too good to pass up i mean bottomless french fries it doesnt get better for when you want to indulge a bit for sandwiches and salads its a good option my husband always orders the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich topped with cheddar barbeque sauce and crispy onions  i tend to order the southwest grilled chicken salad it has chicken avocado red and green bell pepper black beans corn cheese and fried jalapeno coins a few fried jalapeno coins make this girl very happy i could probably eat an entire basket of those bad boys the restaurant seems to be on a wait a lot during the weekends so be prepared to wait at peak timesthis walmart was okay  we stopped in to grab some groceries on our way home from the mountains its about 10 minutes from the pa turnpike  from the looks of the place its huge we thought it was a super walmart but no  so no fresh meats or produce or any of the other good stuff super walmarts offer  it also seemed a little disorganized to me so it took me awhile to find the things i was looking for  oh well  wed stop in for conveniences sake again but at least well know next time what they have and dont have so we can plan accordinglylooking for a quick dinner during the week  2 of 3 of us vegetarians i am not ordered the number 4 combo 2 tacos beef beef enchilada and  chile con queso with beef  pretty good  a lot of food the menu actually had a nonmeat section so the vegetarians did well here service was servicable  nothing special but not badthe food was delicious we had both a chicago style and a ny style for the kids but we stole one lol the service was also pretty good the reason for the 3 stars is solely for the lack of credit card acceptance i usually carry little to no cash and always pay with credit cards and we were not notified until we tried to pay that credit cards are not accepted is this 1980 i can count on one hand how many times ive had 70 bucks on me in the last year what would they have done if i didnt have the cash on memost of the time the food is delicious  but lately the food and the drinks have suffered today i got grilled cheese sandwiches and they were terrible how does someone mess up a grilled cheese sandwich  plus i got to cherry dr peppers and they both tasted horrible  one was too sweet and the other one honestly i couldnt describe the taste except that it was baddecided to stop in for a bite an ordered the southwestern wings an the crabby corn  quesadilla the wings are spicy not sure why cause they should only have cilantro garlic olive oil an lime according to the menu the quesadilla was fine but needed some sour cream or dipping sauce on the side its dark in here also very darkive only had culvers a few timesthe best part for me is always the fries this little drivein restaurant in the tiny town i grew up in had the same kind they are crinkle cut but thin delicious this time i had the tenderloin which was not quite up to my hoosier standards it tasted good but something was off for me on the texture i like thin breading and this was a bit on the thick side i have had the fish sandwich on my only other visit to culvers and it was good fries are where it is at it is a bit more expensive than standard drive thru but they make it when you order you may have to wait a few minutes longer than a normal drive thru too i will wait for fresh food the food is decent not great not bad fairly priced i also think they might be rationing napkins the dining area and parking lot are not very fun the drive thru line goes right through the middle of the parking lot waited 5 minutes to back out and leave seating is scarce and the lines to order and pick up might as well be sitting on your lap i wont tell you not to go you might like it it just wasnt for menot recommended if you are hungry unable to provide timely service food could be better for the time it takes to receive your meal also they should not serve burned hash browns coffee was goodserious disappointment   this place could be awesome but there were only like 3 cookies to choose from the brownies were great and the cookies were good avoid the candyonly a crazy person would take a huge party here when the group was known to include many vegans it happened it wasnt my fault i went along to enjoy my allotment of tasty meats  thank gosh the salad bar is so diverse and fresh otherwise half our group would have starved  we always get consistent service and enjoy ourselves just be warned this place is about meat meat and more meat vegans stay awayon a recent evening some girlfriends and i went to zeppoli for a night hopeful of good food and good company they had just opened only about a month prior so we were openminded but also knew the chef was reputable and a few reviews on here said everything was good although we were skeptical if they were customer written or employee written but we were pretty confident that the food would be good  and in the grand scheme of things the food was good the other components though are what prompted me to write my first ever yelp review and my girlfriends were all on board with me writing this as they too felt the same way  first i would like to say that the service was great  our server had literally just started working there a reddishbrownblonde haired girl named christina i believe and she fared very well  checking with the kitchen when she couldnt answer our questions raving about the desserts and rightfully so and also being very friendly and reading our table appropriately the atmosphere was simple nice clean kind of cutedefinitely could use a little color perhaps our server told us that the plates were smaller and so do not expect heaping portions this was ok with us and how we preferred it usually she mentioned that the chef suggests we order an appetizer pasta and an entree  that was how the menu was created  we ordered appetizers each an entree and each a dessert the portions were indeed very small but some of what we ordered definitely did not equate to any value whatsoever a seafood dish  with a few pieces of seafood and some cous cous was 26 the special with lamb and gnocchi was similarly priced and also was a small portion  all of the desserts although very good except the flourless chocolate torte was very unexciting were 8 each that is expensive we felt as though some of the prices were citylike prices but we were in collingswood our bill including gratuity came to just over 250 thats 50 a personfor a byob  insane we were all still hungry after dinner and hence why we all ordered dessert  which we never ever do overall we each ordered one entree one dessert and we all split two appetizers the one appetizer was the antipasti which we tripled per the servers suggestion because its 9 per person and it was a very small portion with very little cheese or meat in the end we paid 27 for an appetizer of mostly marinated vegetables and such that is just ridiculous and absurd all in all we enjoyed ourselves because of the company of each other and we did enjoy some of the food but for the price i know i will never go back and having spoken to the others i know they feel the same way its unfortunate because the place has potentialthe yogurt has great flavor but you really need to be careful or youll end up spending a fortune the yogurt and toppings are sold by the ounce since the cups are so large you dont realize how much youre getting until you put it on the scale to pay  i love their yogurt but id rather the old fashion method of small medium large for pricing the shock at the register isnt worth it if you go often you can start to sense how much your bowl will cost ive gotten consistent at keeping it under 3 but i dont get muchok we made a stop here for a nice dinner on our travels home from spring break first of all all of the food was wonderful atmosphere was pretty neat as well  our server was very attentive and friendly but not overbearingas a server myselfthat is important knowing just the right level of interaction desired by a serverthumbs upthe reason i have rated a 3 out of 5 is because unlike the server food and atmosphere there was a manwho seemed to be in the role of a server assistantkey hourlyhe was extremely rude with his looks and demeanori wish i knew his name because i would make that known but i didnt see a name tag so i def recommend for amazing food and as long as no interaction with this man im positive your experience will be awesomeclean lots of toppingsno line the overall flavor of the yogurt mediocre as an overweight person the worker  made me feel a little bit uncomfortable when he weighed by ice cream 3 times because it was over 9 for just minetheir breakfast is wicked cheap cheaper than those swanky hotels lining the street and theyre open until 4am fridays and saturdays  and they have jalapeno poppers winner combinationawesome idea  execution is a bit haphazard sometimes it can be absolutely amazing sometimes not and it can be a bit loud   all that being said it is still the best burgers in the city and the best milkshakes in missourii spent a few hours at the starbucks the other day doing some work on the computer sometimes you just have a different scenery i noticed that this starbucks is a neighborhood starbucks pretty much the people that came in  know the employees me personally im not a huge starbucks fan i dont drink a lot of coffee but the atmosphere is so calming and soothing and the smell of the coffee in the teas and pastries are somewhat relaxing so what the fall season they have all these new and  different coffee mixes for the fall season that customers  are flocking in to get   i decided to try the iced caramel macchiato with pumpkin sauce instead of vanilla let me tell you it was an acquired taste very different yet delicious  you can earn starbucks rewards and have a starbucks account and you can purchase really cool glasses and cups they have an online store where you can purchase items and coffees of all different flavors  the holidays are coming soon so there will be all kinds of  gifts to purchase friends and family although im not a coffee drinker i do love the starbucks atmospherelet me start out with the food is amazing and i would give them more stars if the service wasnt subpar the young lady who rang me up could communicate better i ordered a kids menu burger fries and drink i told her i worked at the mall they give mall discounts but the total was still the same i had to ask her again and than she said that they dont give discounts under 10 which is fine just communicate this the only choices for drink were sodas and energy drinks i told her i didnt want these and she just said well it comes with a drink she had to ask the manager if i could have a water but the food again was amazing so im giving his place a second chance this time the manager rang me up he is so forlorn i tried to make conversation with him the owner has shopped in my store before nothing he seems perturbed that im even there too bad the grill cook is behind the counter he is always a pleasurei ordered a havana yacht club sandwich ham turkey spanish chorizo bacon swiss and provolone for 1050 it turns out that spanish chorizo is much different than mexican chorizo but i enjoyed the sandwich it was big the bread is fresh taste of havana offers the option of ordering a side and soft drink for an additional 250 you dont need a side dish though the sandwich is enough to fill you up   the staff was very friendly and nice to me as i placed my order it takes longer than you would think for them to make a sandwich as i was eating they walked out from behind the counter to near my table and started talking in spanish and laughing it was probably perfectly innocent but it seemed like they were making fun of me as i ate my meal it felt awkward   my sandwich was good but it was too expensive i would give a higher rating if the prices were lowerthe meat is not fresh at all but you can get the traditional chinese food especially seasoning or something like this herei love the aesthetics and culture of this place its very clean and has a warm enviroment although  i was impressed by the culture and presentation the food could do more justicegood for drunken college nights not sure what its doing in carmel indiana besides inviting us to relive those unfortunate choices but if youre going to make sure to get the taco sticks this location holds true to the disappointment of any standard type of pizza if pizza is a must though go with the loaded totzafor what it is this cafe isnt badbut based on my one visit it just wasnt anything particularly special or memorable either  its situated in the small downtown area of clearwater theres not much going on down there but unfortunately i still had to pay for parking at a nearby garage theres some free parking nearby on nights and weekends the cafe is pretty cool inside  has interesting decor that seems both elegant and modern but also distinctly steampunk style one major drawback for me is that it was warm as heck in there not sure if there were just ac problems that day or if thats the normal temp but i cut my trip significantly short due to this also a lot of tables and chairs had crumbs or napkinswrappers on them so that was a little offputting as well  the staff that helped me were ok kind of stiff but i guess decent enough i ordered an iced espressobased drink called smores freddo espresso over ice with chocolate sauce a ton of marshmallow whipped cream graham cracker crumbs and a piece of tiramisu again nothing special  both were just ok to me the drink was not nearly as sweet as i hoped it would be bit the espresso was smooth and robust the tiramisu was a little stale like perhaps it had been out in the case too long but the flavors were alright  all in all i dont have anything super critical to say of this place  i just wasnt impressed in any regard in my opinion there are just too many other coffeeshopcafe options i could choose from that would probably also be a little cheaper for me to want to try here againoverall a sub par experience bordering and teetering on a 2 star rating decided to try yoko with all the great reviews about it easy to find in a shopping plaza off the herded path   entered the restaurant and beatles music was playing in the background it seemed only about 5 songs were playing till it was repeated over and over our waitress didnt speak any english which was rather annoying she really didnt understand us and we had trouble understanding her   ordered the miso soup which was very tasty had sushi which was flavorful but ok i was expecting from some of the reviewers fresh fish but it wasnt as fresh as i had hoped i also had the chicken and rice no kobe beef which i was disappointed with bathrooms were very clean and fresh   this place was very cold but the end of the night most customers had jackets on and were freezing i had complained but was ignored very expensive as well for subpar food the place was dead for a saturday night maybe word is getting around  most likely would not returnhotel mazarin  we chose this hotel because it was rated 2 hotel in the french quarter  i was going to give it only 2 stars because it was so loud in our room but there are many good qualities to this charming hotel   ive never been to nola so i wanted to be within walking distance to everything and hotel mazarin is located in the heart of the fq however it is really really close to bourbon street and therefore was loud until 4am every night we stayed a cacophony of music screaming drunk people revving motorcycles honking horns made times square seem like alaska in the dead of winter in comparison   now we chose to visit nola just a couple of months ago so there were only three rooms available we got the king deluxe with a balcony over bienville streetand i see why this room wasnt picked earlier by anyone  the room is nice with marble floors comfortable bed and good view outside  but i would never ever stay here again because im sleep deprived  i wonder if the rooms away from the street are quieter  if so i would reconsider staying here again and give this place a 45 star rating  the front desk people are nice and polite  the bellmen are helpful the concierge is wonderful and got us into restaurants when we couldnt get a reservation  thank you janet  she also booked us on two tours that picked us up right here rooms were clean  wifi is free though too slow for streaming shows or skype most of the time the hotel is beautiful with a central courtyard  complimentary breakfast was pretty good  maybe i am too middle aged and this hotel is only for young party goers  i see now it would have been better to stay block and blocks away from bourbon streetive been back here 3 times since my horrible experience below luckily i didnt see the waiter in question i hope he no longer works there i was brought in the door by the elite event a few months ago it is a great space for a party and i really liked the fudge and the boozy ice cream drinks  i came back here once for just ice cream with allison b and stephanie s during the midtown alley streetfest i got a scoop of after dinner mint and a scoop of coconut almond joy they were delicious i especially like the coconut almond joy its a very unique flavor that i havent seen elsewhere  the other time i tried the food we got the symphony platter to start it was basically cheese garlic bread with pesto i liked it a lot it was dropping with oil though which was a little bit of a turn off then i got the royal grill with stutz salad it took a long time for our food to come out i was glad we got an appetizer my sandwich was just ok there werent many apples on it and despite having special sauce on it it was a bit dry the salad was not good it looked appetizing but the dressing was bland and flavorless i couldnt eat it   i topped the meal off with a scoop of the coconut almond joy yum  all in all id come back now for dessert and appetizers im not sure if ill have a meal here but i might give it one more goif you are looking for fast fast foodughthis is not it  it took 10 minutes to even order our food  speed does not seem to be their thing  we ordered 2 bowls with orange chickentheir speciality right  it still took another 5 minutes to get it i am not sure they are doing things the most effective way or whatbut if you are in a hurry  go elsewhere  the food tastes just like any other panda so you get what you expectit is rare that i give bad reviews but this review in particular is for the super greasy and under cook boneless chicken like how do you serve under cook boneless wings smh this wings stop is the closest to my house so hopefully next time the service and food is better note to self  stick with bone in pleaseperhaps i need to give prep and pastry a second shot because my first visit was not as amazing as the reviews would suggest  i must give them a lot of credit for their unique menu impressive bakery and extensive array of brunch cocktails  i also loved the rustic venue with its high ceilings and wood floors  our waiter was a delight he really made our experience a pleasant one    my only criticism is the food  i was told that i have to order the french toast because its their specialty  i ending up getting the french toast of the day which had whipped cream blueberries sweet cream cheese and brioche bread  to begin with the portion was way too big  they gave me four huge slices and im the type of person who prefers less food so that i can enjoy my meal without feeling engorged  the texture of the french toast was too dry it seems like they didnt soak it in the custard long enough  there were very few blueberries and the combo of whipped cream and cream cheese was just too rich  maybe i ordered the wrong item  my mom had the am relleno which was the perfect portion size and very tasty but a little too spicy  my brother ordered the monte cristo with a side of biscuits and gravy  again the portion was out of control  two giant sandwiches that were impossible to eat with a ton of potatoes  altogether just too heavy  as for the drinks my coffee and peachorange mimosa was delicious but the red sangria was far too sweet  to top it off this place is crazy busy on the weekend  my family and i got there at 9am so we only had to wait about 20 minutes  after 10am it was a zoo  im probably in the minority here but i think prep and pastry is trying too hard to impress their customers with lots of flavors and huge portions  they should scale back and simplify  i know its brunch and its supposed to be decadent but you have to strike a balance  i think ill stick with bline for breakfastwent here last night for the first time  parking is horrible but so is everything on south grand  the place is smaller than i expected but it was quaint  they had a really good selection of martinis as thats what they are known for but the service wasnt very good  even though we were at a table with a server we still had to go back up the bar to get drinks and cash out  i may consider going back another time strictly for the martinis  i will probably sit at the bar next timei have to say i have never dined here but one night i was lucky enough to find a parking spot to go inside and order some donuts i was surprised at how expansive the space was one half of the space is just for donuts and the other half for sit down diner food  its true what harden says you can find cops eating there all the time at night im not sure if their service is as good as the first reviewer mentioned but they make a pretty tasty mushroom swiss burger  their donuts are really good soo good that my sister ordered a mini donut tray for a party and they were a big hit they also have one of the better kingcakes in town if you dont want to drive to gretna for your kingcake fixfirst time here the wife wanted pizza and somehow the place showed up on the list of best pizza in indy huge fan of 3wiseman but we want try something else for a change the porter was good scotch eggs were pretty good as well didnt enjoy the beer cheese crock with bread found it a bit salty and way more beer than cheese as for the pizza we went with a large pub pizza which was good but 3wisemen dr herrs is still much better best part of the meal would be the bread pudding just good sweet bread pudding with some layers of chocolate and a good strong bourbon glaze overall the dining experience was ok maybe wed come back some other time and try the other dishesthe organ box that you get is nice and well cutpacked but the service is not the best first they deliver only one day a week and since exactly on that day i have all my important meetings it was pretty difficult to arrange a delivery they almost wanted to leave the frozen pieces in a box behind a door on a relatively busy street in my organ box there were no pieces of tail at first place but what i finally got after sending couple of emailslayout is a bit questionable and their ancillary selection which should be the redeeming factor here is a bit lighter than expected still fuel points are great and sticking to the kroger network helps those little tidies all add up so despite wandering around for far longer than i should have been in search of something that the store ultimately and moderately unbelievably did not have this one gets a pass wine and beer selection here also seemed a bit on the slight sidealbertsons is still the best bet in this market for obvious reasons and were it not for those pointsone other thing of notethe gas pumps for this location are nowhere near the actual storea couple of colleagues and coworkers rave about this place so we checked it out one time   similar to a quick chipotlestyle choose your toppings lineup its fast and fairly quick i ordered a veggie burrito combo lunch meal which came with a hefty size burrito chips and salsa and a large drink it was good but nothing to rave about   the service was quick and nice but i cant say i had the same feelings towards this place as i had previously heard from othersinteresting pairing of tacos and donuts  they tried for the trend factor and it was just ok there is only one counter to order so pray there is not a large family in front of you it looks family friendly but then there is a bar a coffee bar would probably make more sense it was slow for a friday eve food was just ok too much jalapeo in the cheese sauce they cant easily customize your orderexample  i just wanted plain shredded cheese instead of spice  no can do  donuts were good waiters were very friendly i will give it another shot but not as wowed as other reviewersgood intentions but poor execution in some areas friendly staff relaxed and quirky atmosphere especially the music if not the best decor our waiter was very attentive and nice but a bit forgetful so some of the dishes we requested did not make it to the table  the chicken and waffles were quite tasty but sliders they were not but cut that waffle piece in half use it to sandwich the chicken and its close enough we were not offered much syrup with them and ended up requesting more on the side so i dont think we really got to perceive the sriracha component that was supposed to be present   cowboy burger was freshly made and the meat juicy but the bottled overly sweet bbq sauce ruined it a bit the turkey burger was similarly fresh but suffered from a conflict in flavors roasted garlic hummus is tasty  but it and possibly the spices in the patty itself competed with a cranberry chutney i was hoping to taste fries needed salt the sauteed spinach was far too oily to eat those who ordered enchiladas were happy enough the places eponymous grilled cheese lacked cheese so that was a bit of a letdown  we did not try the ice cream or the desserts that generally garner positive reviews but at that point we didnt want to be disappointed any further this is an okay place with the potential to be quite nice but it could use a little bit of editing in the menu and its execution stop by for the chicken and waffles if nothing else1 disgusting truffle oil fries the only reason why people use crap like truffle oil is to make the food seem fancy fries are something that do not need truffle oil flavoring especially not fake truffle flavoring that nearly all restaurants use   fyi folks almost all truffle oil is not made from truffles its made from synthetic chemicals  2 they do have delicious sliders and delicious seafood slidersi hate change  i could walk around the old shoprite blindfolded and know exactly where to put my hand on which shelf to grab what i need and still get outta there quicker than this fiasco they call the new shoprite    its not terrible but its got some kinks it needs to work out and by work out i mean the whole layout needs to be demolished and then redesigned to accommodate the large crowds    i dont think they took into account that double the amount of people will be crammed into this space regardless of square footage  not only do you have the old snyder shoprite folks now begrudgingly making their way over to the new location you still have the former oregon pathmark people who are like hey this is our turf  its literally the only onestop shop unless you wanna go to walmart or target for terrible meatproduce selections and lets face it no one wants to go there unless absolutely necessary  shoprites selections and deals are the shiiitttt  so anyway the pros larger space for dat entrance doe with all the fun extra shit we never had or probably needed before like a hot chinese food buffet sushi area amazing cheese variety way more fresh donuts pastries cakes breads etc and a sweet bonus tuckedawayinacorner pricy organic section where you can get 8 brown sugar tons more of the 15 items or less registers with kitschy signs named after philly streets   pro tip you can also check out at customer service during high volume  which it always is toiletriesbathroom stuff section is in the dead center of the aisles lower shelves and very well lit  seems much better than the last place and has a great selection parking lot is larger i think  i havent encountered many problems with this the inner aisles seem spacier and more breathable and everything seems to have a better selectionvariety in general  as for the outskirts of the store stay tuned below they finally adopted the giant family boxes of cereal like target  buy in bulk people  the cons carts allllll the way on the left when the entrance is allllll the way on the right  produce area is justweird  like i gotta dig inside deep  shelving to get to the good onions instead of them being out in the open i guess so peoples grubby fingers dont touch everything at once every goddamn thing i need besides the meat luckily is in coolers with doors in the wall now as opposed to the old grab and go looseygoosey feel  so if 10 people need milkojeggsjuiceyogurt in the same area youre in you best be sure youve gotta politely wait for 10 people to browse select and leave  legit the giant area from where the coolers start to where they end is just a sea of people and carts youve gotta meander through  honestly forego the cart and do small basket grocery runs to save yourself the hassle if you can the dreaded crowds the fishmeatcoolers sections are terrible but even worse is the checkout lines  somehow the old place managed to get a handle on this  i think this space is narrower here  try to get to the speedy checkout if you only have a little bit but otherwise have fun finding where one line ends and the other begins with all the damn carts  overall come here on offpeak hours  avoid the weekends  a tuesday night is better than a saturday morningright off exit 7 on the njtp south  has a drive through and a big parking lot right next to a convenience storeit is a nashville staple that must be tried but only if you have the time as the line to get in tends to wrap around the building and typically results in a wait of about an hour or so  because of its reputation its a magnet for tourists especially on the weekends  my favorite time to go is in the early afternoon during the week after the lunch rush but before they close at 3  its really the best way to enjoy pancake pantry  the food is sturdy traditional delicious breakfast fare that is served up fresh and plentiful  dont come here if youre not eating carbs or are looking for fancy breakfast cuisine  pretty much anything they offer is good so much so that im hard pressed to pick a favorite menu item  they serve real maple syrup which is a rare thing to find especially down south  the servers are friendly but brisk as they are well aware of the line outside  the table service and turnover is actually pretty efficient so even though youre waiting in line for an hour expect to get your food within 10 or so minutes of ordering    the reason for the long wait is the small size of the restaurant  theyve masterfully put as many tables as they can in their dining room but its nowhere near the capacity needed to fill the demand  heres a hint and a tip for coming her in a large group  dont  its not a very good place to go eat if youve got more than three or so people with you unless you plan to split up and sit at different tables  and its aggravating for those waiting in line who have to wait longer because they now have to take three of their already limited tables to fit your whole group  one little unknown thing about pancake pantry is that you can order food to go which is a great way to get a delicious breakfast and not have to wait around for it  if youre in a hurry or just impatient call your order in ahead of time grab it and go  also they serve sandwiches salads and soups for those of you nonbreakfast eaters though i dont know anyone who goes there strictly to eat lunchneeded a few things was in the area so stopped in this store  safeway never seems to have any real competitive prices on things i buy in other words not cheap  we wanted to purchase something from the bakery department of which there was need for an employees assistance  trying to get someones attention in the department was unsuccessful so i found another employee and asked him to assist he did get another from the deli and we got what we wanted and went on our way  we were told no one was working in the bakery  it took a few minutes for the person to be found and brought over to help and this gave us time to actually look over the department man this place needs a good scrub what we saw could not have been the result of one days neglect we almost left before we were actually helped but braved it and hope we did not kill anyone that received what we bought  perhaps someone should be working the department if for no other reason to clean it upfriendly bartender the beer was middle of the road quality  folks seemed to enjoy the molecular munchies food truck  the ambiance fits the tech park environmentbreakfast in my hometown  i like sharing dining experiences with my family whenever i come home  the food at pancake pantry is ok  the service is excellentthe curry is soupy the pad thai is too saltysaucy i like that they have a lunch menu special but it feels like theyre catering to the american palateive never been here before but the waitress is probably the rudest i have ever encountered  her patience is lowits a cute corner coffee shop ive never been too impressed with their drinks tbh i wouldnt recommend going there for that at all but their pastries are legit especially the banana bread and cookies id suggest they get vegan cookies for the lactose intolerant folks but otherwise the place is pretty cool its more of a oh crap whats close by than a lets drive here kind of place mornings its full of construction workers no harm to them i get it but theres no where to really sit or stand thats not in the way of someone else one up point the people who work behind the counter are all genuine and friendly ive never had a bad experience due to them but im most excited to see how theyll grow and hopefully how their reputation will improvei really wanted to give a 5 star review and on some of the dishes i can but others were average and others a bit below  the sausage and broccoli rabe was very good clearly housemade  the sardines were huge and nicely grilled  the lemon pasta the reason i was so excited to go was awful  the delicate homemade noodles were completely lost in what appeared to be straight lemon juice  the seafood stew with a moroccan vibe was delicious and the bass was ok  the almond pannacotta was light and lovely but the zeppoli were large and really just sweet    its a lovely little place very friendly and helpful staff but tiny and with really hard uncomfortable chairs maybe a way to move diners along to make room for the next batch  when our check came we were told that the credit card machine was down and they could only accept cash  would have been nice to know before we ordered almost 200 worth of foodi was expecting more from baileys range but i think theyre still working out the kinks at least i hope so there was a crowd saturday night but no wait when we got there around 730 we were seated at the last 2person table upstairs directly overlooking the kitchen so lets just say i got to watch a whole lot of chaos including an order being returned orders sitting way too long on the counter and just general pandemonium  i dont get the long communal table downstairs all the different parties were seated with empty chairs between them so isnt that just a huge waste of space and if you do sit strangers right next to each other who wants that i definitely do not  service seemed to be hit or miss our waitress took forever to take our order and bring out the check but our food came out pretty quickly conversely the table right behind us came in 10 minutes after us but they had their desserts and check way before us  i really liked the smoked onions rings at first but then the more i ate the less i liked they have a thick soft batter on them and the onions are thickly cut we didnt get appetizer plates when they were brought out yet the dipping sauce is served in a small jar that you cant fit an onion ring into unless you cut it up im all for the cute little touches in this place like the jars but in this case its not functional  i also wasnt a fan of the two types of catsup i tried the normal that comes with the burgers is really sweet and i got the crazy catsup with my fries and liked that even less kudos for making their own sauces but in this case i prefer heinz  however the fries were really good salty and hot i ordered the patty melt which came on crustless rye instead of the homemade bun by the time the food was delivered the bread was soaked through with grease so i had to eat it with a fork it tasted pretty good but i couldnt differentiate between the mo grassfed beef and beef at any other restaurant it was a little crumbly too i ordered no pink though the onions were too thickly sliced for my liking but the rooster sauce tasted good the burgers come with lettuce tomato onions and pickle slices on the side the 2 tiny pickle chips i got were so good but they covered about half my burger the same is true of the tiny tomato slices extra pickles cost extra bad  they have the largest soda selection of any place ive ever been pretty much anything you could possibly want they have i went with the cola on draft good stuff  since we were at the very last table we were closest to the upstairs soda fountain and dirty dishes table where the servers stack all the dirty dishes it seemed like the wait staff was a little frazzled and i definitely overheard some complaints coming from them the dirty dishes were stacked so high i thought they were going to fall over apparently no one was coming up to take them to the kitchen yet i saw one employee filling water bottles the entire time and another wiping glasses the entire time i think they just need some better organization here   for 2 burgers 2 sodas onion rings and small fries our bill came to 30  tip not too baddierbergs in brentwood is a pretty decent grocery store thats about it because its like a grocery store with groceriesand sometimes wifi  way back when i was stocking my cabinets with food instead of books dierbergs and trader joes was a weekly run i bought the hell out of couscous cheese sparkling grape juice and fruit leather the cheese packaged instore was phenomenal plus i loved having an entire aisle dedicated to organicnaturalspecial diet items being able to pick up vitamins sweet potato chips dark chocolate frozen indian meals and toothpaste within 10 feet was perfect the selection for these items was greater than at schnucks and the store always was cleaner youd pay 0501 more for things but that was an acceptable tradeoff also huzzah for the store being at a metrolink stop  dierbergs still has all of that but i use the store completely differently now these days i go for lunch snacks and wifi i grab fresh fruit from the produce section make a salad from the bar pick up a 050 bottle of water and head to the cafe area to eat while writing the store still works but over the past few months ive had some setbacks  salad bar  not the best selectionvariety of toppings   bar always is messy  labels are used only about half the time  not as vegetarian friendly as it first appears kidney beans are usually the only kind of vegetarian protein available and those arent put out all the time meaty toppingspasta salads often are in back so customers spill them into the vegetarian ones toward the front during the reach labels dont have vegetarian notation and its hard to see whats in some of the pastas hot soups arent vegetarian despite being broccoli or vegetable usually made with meatbased stockbroth  i asked  wifi cafe  convenient nook at the front of the store bright and pleasant thanks to large windows  out of about 14 tablesbooths only one of them has an outlet and its not accessible unless youre sitting in that booth  wifi takes forever to be recognized and then to connect sometimes it doesnt happen at all  if wifi is working its often very slow it also bans you from most streaming media no im not trying to watch netflix but for my job i often need to listen to individual songs or watch videos embedded within blog posts despite this spotify works for some reason though not well  there are no utensils near the cafe area so if you drop your fork you have to go all the way back to the salad bar to get it  not awesome when youve already got your laptop and such strewn about why not stock some utensils at the cafe area with the coffee cups and napkins  generally i like dierbergs if i actually kept food at my place id likely buy some of it here and having a store and wifi cafe in the inner ring is nice for a quick stop between clients but even though dierbergs is a little better than regular schnucks stores it could learn a lot about salad bar arrangement and maintenance and wifi cafes from schnucks culinaria model downtowni arrived to work today feeling a little under the weather aka i drank my weight in wine last night and felt like death warmed over i decided to drink oj for breakfast and load up on calories for lunch pizza thats a no brainer  i walked to the comcast center with a friend and chose a slice of la scalas pizza of the day which was pepperoni and sausage and also asked for a plain slice to top it off i ordered a root beer soda my total was close to 9 i havent had any of their entrees but they all looked delicious sitting pretty behind the display glass my name was called a few minutes after i ordered and i loaded up my pizza slices with crushed red pepper and garlic from the tray located a few feet in front of the setup  the pizza was a little too greasy but nothing a few napkins couldnt take care of each bite was delicious and the crust was fantastic if i win the lottery or am lucky enough to get an annual raise this year ill be sure to make la scalas a favorite eatery until then i might have to stick with 5 foot long sandwichesthis place has pretty good food for a decent price and its close to my house sold   as some other yelpers have said the atmosphere is a little off so i prefer to get it to go its very casual to say the least its very open and usually quietempty so you almost feel like youre intruding on the employees when dining in each time ive dined in weve been the only occupied table its a little awkward and the tv on the wall is always playing pop music videos   the menu is limited but the hummus salad homemade chips and yeero as they call it are all pretty good i saw a sign the other day that they have added falafel to the menu  its about time   the staff has always been very friendly and helpful one employee recognized us and somehow remembered that a few weeks before we had ordered the same thing and brought us samples of a couple of different things to try while we waited hopefully she just has a really good memory and they dont just have that few customers   the menu seems to keep growing and it seems to be getting more popular so i may have to reevaluate after my next visitcame here for brunch on a monday by suggestion of one of the merchants across the street i was one of two patrons so the bartender was very attentive although the food was still slow to arrive i liked fresh muddled fruit mimosas and was torn between the fried green tomato benedict sandwich which was on special and the spicy boudin omelet the bartender suggested the omelet which was quite good although the cheese grits were not but im spoiled see my review for trips dinercute little restaurant very good for sunday brunch we avoided the long lines of other nolibs and downtown places i had the huervos mexicanos  very tasty  attentive service wide menu authentic mexican foodi visited with for the first time this last weekend  my sister and i popped in to check it out first impression of the interior was good its cute to keep the core i want to like the place because i think its great that they opened up a bakery on cherokee street   second impression the girl working behind the counter this last saturday is not really the best person to represent whisk she did not go out of her way to be personable didnt smile in fact didnt say much of anything  maybe she was the last choice because everyone else was working at the best of missouri at mobot  we both chose the blueberry scone it was pretty darn good  i would definitely stop back into whisk to sample more of their sweetsthe diner experience in a space that feels nothing like a diner  the best dish that mtjic serves up is the cajun turkey meatloaf  it is a large portion on top of mash potatoes and they serve it up with a whole head of steamed broccoli  the grilled cheese was also tasty with a cup of tomato bisque the french fries were really good thin perfectly fried and delicious  the service is friendly but during the dinner rush was a bit on the slow sideive been coming here for years and its usually a good place but this past trip was terrible i ordered a breakfast meal and was told they were waiting on hashbrowns i watched the cook make several meals and 15 minutes later caught my eye and asked a coworker yall needed a hashbrown 15 minutes after my order was placed she got around to my hashbrown they gave me an extra hash brown with a sorry about that i dont care for extra food at a 15 minute wait with 8 customers coming and going in that time refund my meal or give me a comp on the next  terribletasted pretty good however for 11 the portion size of my brisket sandwich was far too smalllet me just start with this place has the best cannolies they are delish and made with fresh ricotta cheese which is the only reason ill go back but the service is thumbs down the host probably owners son was rude and texting on his phone during our whole meal mind you there for some reason was a host on every wing of the restaurant equaling 3 my aunt asked for lemons and he referred us to our waiter our waiter was ok but was in a rush with every request seems that quality over quantity was not his goal we sat a bit after to digest and finish our drinks they were like hawks to our check after returning to give him a cash tip in hand my girlfriend noticed the waiter rolls his eyes to the host in response to i guess the amount of our 15 tip we usually will tip over 20 but not this time   on a positive note cannolies can be bought as take out no tipping requiredill start with saying the guac at this place is great so so on to the tacos tried the carne asada pollo and chicarrone tacos not bad quality of meat the tortillas were a little dry and broke apart the carne was good but the chicarrone was a little soggy prefer it crispywe went there as a group our meetup group chose this place for dinner  a show they had a package with the sketch players its a great idea dinner  a show it was not understood exactly at first that the show wasnt there we had to go someplace else but that was ok   all the people that were there for the dinner  show made it rather loud it has a quaint ambiance hence the name it was a train station with the old fashioned high ceilings  tile floors made it hard for conversation also the large glass windows made it unbearable to see with a low setting bright sun so if any thought could be put into some acoustical tiles or some sun glare help with the glass without taking away from the charm it would be a bonus  onto the food i had the herb encrusted sirloin of beef  sliced tenderloin served on a bed of wild mushrooms topped with the chefs signature barnaise sauce it was very good the beef was tender but could have used a few more potatoes i got 2 wedges maybe even a mashed potatoes  my husband had stuffed salmon florentine  fresh farm raised salmon stuffed with crabmeat and baby spinach lightly dusted with ritz crackers and topped with hollandaise sauce he said it was ehhh ok i tasted it  it was awful according to me it was like a mrs pauls frozen something or other i would think even if they did a fried flounder or something there it would be better then this frozen item they just stuck in the oven there was a mix up with our order we were there for this large event so the restaurant was packed with trying to get us to the show on time they somehow missed our ticket the manager came over  apologized  then our order came out quickly which may or may not have attributed to the fish maybe not being done it wasnt hot it was only room temperature we would try it again on a less busy night to consider possibly a better rating however we probably still wouldnt recommend the fisha nice little ice creamdessert shop next to coccos pizza theres a fair selection of homemade gelato and its ok but honestly you can find much better downtown they have a wide variety of other desserts as well including ice cream cakes cookies etc oh and coffee who doesnt love coffee with dessert  the decor is cute with ice cream parlour wireback chairs tables and a comfy couch to cuddle up on while you eat your sweet treat its nice to have a convenient place to satisfy your sweet tooth instead of just grabbing a pint of ice cream at wawawrong brewery for a margarita  i was beered out from a bbq the day before but wife and i wanted to sit outside and enjoy a margarita with lunch the only quality tequila they had was patron so thats what wife and i ordered unfortunately the drinks came out extremely watered down but it was hot we were thirsty we had committed to tequila so we ordered a second round when i got the bill those tequilaflavored glasses of water were14 each a bev total of 56 for four drinks  serves me right for ordering a margarita at a brewery but if a place cant do it right why bother even offering it   the food is good and the staff is friendly the deck could use a little more charm and shade during the day and 14 for a high quality margarita might be fair in new york city however margaritawater in carmel might be worth a fiver even if it is patronwent for dinner great reviews   pricey but food was good so i didnt care   our waitress omg  she repeated our drinks 4 times  yes coke diet coke and water   food came out quickly  she brought our check and then just lingered and lingered and lingered how uncomfortable we handed her our credit card she processed it and brought it back to us explaining what we need to do  yes thank you i know how to sign my name on the line  she  then again lingered and lingered till we signed   my very patient husband was no longer patient i dont think ive seen him so angrybeen here before when we came to town liked their lasagna but this time around it was dry and over cooked wife had the ribs and those where meaty but also dry so food is or was this time soso  on the other hand service was very good think the place is interesting and good if you have kidsthis is my first time to ever feel the need to leave a review at any restaurant i eat at granite city maybe once a month good beer and good service i ate here last weekend and sat at the bar great bartenders and service was on point this night up until lets just say a very unexpected experience for the entire bar i have never experienced anything like this and was not expecting it from granite city as i consider it one of the more classy establishments but i guess being next to a hotel you never know what people could frequent there out of nowhere the entire bar hears people screaming specifically one lady now i have no idea what was going on as i was adjacent at the bar but it escalated quickly the blonde bartender says she is going to get the manager and quickly after the manager appears behind the bar the lady is cussing at the manager and bartender yelling distracting everyone the manager was a young woman i dont recall her name but is there every time i have ever been in the building she tells her bartender that its ok she would handle things and could tell her first concern was that bartender was ok i was pleasantly surprised by that then proceeds to get yelled at by lady and man which i assumed to be the ladys husband or boyfriend the manager is calm the whole time asking them to calm down but they refused mind you this has been going on for several minutes and she finally asks them to leave the manager remained professional and polite meanwhile being cussed at repeatedly i can not hear every word as i was not directly beside the people but she did ask them to leave and the man wanted to talk to another manager there was a man standing around watching and come to find out this was the general manager he was watching this happen and did not speak up until man requested another manager and thats when the lady pointed him in the man general managers direction being a man and finding out the general manager who is also a man was letting his female staff be yelled at and cussed is what drove me to leaving this review now i do not know what the general manager said to this man because they went outside to talk but the man came back in and had a margarita at the bar after he was asked to leave by the other manager how does that work is my question the young woman manager apologized to the bar for the disruption and asked if there was anything she could do before she walked away i have never experienced anything like this like i prior stated i would have thought the young woman was general manager by how the situation was handled i wrote this review not to scrutinize anyone but hope someone of higher power sees this and finds out what is going on in that place with upper management again restaurant is great and never have had any complaints just this weekend was out of the usual for this place2 star food 5 star service could get better food else where i ordered my food and it was at my table so fast you could freak was it already mademostly cheese and sauce while the rest is premade place was packed too our waiter was great menu needs more descriptions in both english and spanish on food items desert menu is verbal which is senseless because its a high margin addon as a owner or manager i want to offer it all not depend on my staff to verbalize it specials menuabsenti noticed a chalk board on my way outkids menu absent theres alot of potential here i doubt we will returnkaty perry kissed a  girl and liked it i had a mcrib sandwich and didnt like it   the other day on my way to work without a lunch the morning djs were talking about the mcrib and the limited availability in all the years mcrib has been offered i have never tried it with its departure from the menu coming up soon and the positive spin one of the djs gave i thought id try one for lunch   i ordered a mcrib combo meal with a small french fry and small coke kevin the dj said he orders his without pickle and onions i like pickles and onions so i kept them on mine im glad that i did the bun along with the crisp pickles and onions were the best thing about the sandwich the processed meat was tasteless it was over sauced with a bbq that was way to sweet i thank my luck stars that i had an order of fries i only wished i had upgraded to a larger size to fill the void left by a flavorless sandwich   this is a very clean and friendly mcdonalds i will not lower their star rating due to a seasonal sandwich that i did not enjoy however i would not recommend a mcrib to anyone not even my worst enemywe came here on saturday morning expected to have a small wait food however is average and service also very average definitely not an exceptional breakfast placei had the most fabulous salt caramel shake last night it was excellent perfecti only wish i had ordered the large i will be back for sure for another one of these shakes  i met a friend here for dinner we both ordered the hamburger fries onion rings and the date salad   the burgers were nothing special i was asked how i wanted it cooked and i said medium and it came out well done i still ate it it was kind of on the cold side and the bun was too chewy and not very fresh the fries were ok nothing special my friend had the onion rings and i tasted one which was great   since i was paying  i thought over 50 bucks for a very mediocre simple dinner for 2 with the main course being hamburger was a bit stiff  also and im being a bit of a snob i know but youd think with all the floor to ceiling windows they would keep them clean they were filthy everyone of them and while im at it i also thought the seating was a bit uncomfortable who the hell wants to sit at a picnic table to eat inside   i will be back for the shake but nothing elsesmall place inexpensive  mediterranean in style but not my type of food service was slow  had a place to sit inside casual  more for younger crowd  quick bitemy wife and were so excited when culvers was being built but working in food service as managers we didnt get a chance to try you guys out until today   got a warm welcome from employees that were leaving but a bare stare as we were asking questions at the register so we figured out the menu ourselves because we would of just got yes or no answers    was excited about the cheese churd and they were very delicious i had the the melt and very good but a little greasy for my taste  as a manager i know customer service should be number one and the presence of a manager is very important and talking to new guest and building a relationship with the guest should be top of the listi personally thought the buffalo chicken sandwich was delicious it was spicy bread was hot service is fairly quick but my friend got food poisoned here after eating their mashed potatoes so i gotta reduce the rating i actually avoided coming here for as long as possible since i hated the name hahaa few people here said they thought the place was overpriced i have to disagree overall i thought the prices were fair  the service left me more to be desired but that a different thing altogether   i think i paid around 20 for a dinner and a dessert granted it might have been a little more if the waitress had come back to take my drink order as i wanted to wait to try a friends beverage before i ordered it the wine prices were on par we were looking at the list and nothing stood out as over what you would expect to pay for wine in a restaurant   as for the food i really enjoyed it i also got their crme brulee and that was particularly good  one of the nice things was the glassware they had a friend ordered a lambic and it came in the frambrose glass which was cool since you dont normally see them as muchtacos are decent but small and not nearly as flavorful or zesty as some other options in the nashville area the best part about this place is the space itself and the margaritas which are made super quickly at their little bar  i keep coming back to this place because its so quaint and casuali have reviewed this once before but for some reason the review is no longer here  so i will try again  the food is ok i have found the meat philly cheese steak and pulled pork to be tasty but grisilly  one of the best things about this place is the coke dispenser  you can get just about any flavor of soda you can imagine i like sarah found the front counter help not so helpful  no hello or welcome it appears that you have to interact with them first before you can get someone to talk to youwent on a weekday to avoid the reported long line as reported on weekends the service was very good and attentive the food didnt knock my socks off but it was good i cant remember what it was called but i got the chefs special that was some kind of loaded hash brown large portion the cheese on top tasted processed and cheap wasnt the same as left overs too hard and chewy my friend got eggs bacon and a sweet potato pancake it was the same as any other restaurant but what she ordered was pretty basic i couldnt really tell a difference that the pancake was sweet potato just tasted like a pancake she agreed  i was surprised it looks so outdated inside to be such a famous little place making a lot of money it just felt kind of generic  had i stood in line for a long time i wouldnt say it was worth the wait guess i expected more due to the hype maybe i ordered the wrong thing all in all i would go again if someone insisted on eating there and try something differentbut only on a weekday5 stars for the really great use of the developmenthistorical and industrialcrafty dcor and for the attentive wait staff  however i feel compared to other cafes with similar food this place was not as flavorful or filling and overpriced i should have ordered the goddess salad i guess  i ordered the spring roll salad because i love spring rolls and thought there might be similar flavorings  no   really beautiful but i guess i was expecting more  like a spring roll on top or seasoned noodles or something  yes i doused it in the thin dressing but added lots of sriracha salt and pepper but i disappointing for 10  i was still hungry so i ordered the peanut butter shake with almond milk  needed better blending and more thickness especially for 6    i think pictures on the menu would help in the futuresuper bummed to drive all the way from greenwood to tjs for pumpkin spiced cookie butter to find out that they no long had any   still love me some trader joes and walked out with pumpkin salsa corn and pepper soup and a cookie butter chocolate bar if you are looking to try something new and eclectic try tjsthe morning drive thru crew are rock stars they are fast fast fast and very friendly  efficient the same people have worked that position for years and they deserve applause in general this mcdonalds is one of the best theyre good about getting your order right and the employees are nicei got the dragon roll for my order and thought it was ok but not great wasnt really expecting too much there were somewhat a lot of bones in the eel overall decent would go back again if i want quick sushi but the miso soup that came with the roll was very bland really watered downreally a 35  hard to judge because when i walked in on a midsaturday afternoon the place was surprisingly packed  im talking like wall to wall filipinos with the occasional white boyfriend lurking on the sidelines  wow youre doing great i said to the cashier  oh its for a life celebration for a dead person she said blithely  i paid my 12 and shuffled slowly towards the buffet line  there were about 10 people in front of me and wouldnt you know i got the last clean plate but the steam table trays were completely emptied out  we had to wait about 15 minutes for more food to slowly trickle in so i only got to try a few dishes    as usual none of the dishes were labeled  apparently theres an unwritten rule in every frigging filipino restaurant to have unlabeled food items which assumes 1 youre filipino or know some and automatically can identify the dishes  just by sight or smell and 2 your restaurant staff enjoy being asked 987 times a day what is that  here are the dishes i was able to try  lechon  sliced pork belly fried to a crisp  nicely proportioned with not too much fat  crunchy and delicious  kare kare  this is a filipino stew that is a staple  its got peanut butter in it and the universal standard is using oxtail as the main meat but here they chintzed out and used thinly sliced steak  veggies included eggplant and baby bok choy  tasty but a bit too much peanut flavor than what my mom usually uses  flan  a simple custard  flavorful  jasmine rice  fresh hot and moist  i hate dry rice   i did see that others had on their plates pancit and lumpia but i didnt feel like waiting around for the food to come back on the steam trays  overall good decent filipino food  i just need to come back on a normal dayis the egg white delight mcmuffin delightfully delicious yes if you add franks hot sauce   when you break down the nutrition facts and compare the new egg white to the regular mcmuffin there really isnt that much of a difference you save 50 calories and 5 grams of fat ordering the ew ordering the regular egg mcmuffin you lose 1 gram of fiber and get 20 mg less of sodium if you count points on the weight watchers program a regular mcmuffin is 8 points and the new egg white is 7 one point is not that big of a savings the egg whites and white cheddar is not exclusive to the mcmuffin you can try it on any egg  cheese sandwich which means you can have it your way oh wait that is another burger joints phrase   normally i am not a fan of mcdonalds but this one is close to work and surprisingly is better then any of the ones near my home in saint louis when i am in need of a quick breakfast this is a great place to stop the staff is friendly and awake when i stop by at 530 amdefinitely worth a visit for their novelty donuts but for me its not a regular goto type place their weird flavors are unique  mango pineapple oreo blueberry cheesecake banana nut crunch and barts revenge to name a few  but the prices are pretty high we got 6 donuts and a small bottle of milk for 14 my favorite donut was the mango pineapple dont get me wrong i would never say no to the sweet ones but they involved a thick layer of frosting which made them pretty heavy to eat i mainly came here looking for the famed gooey butter cake donut but sadly they didnt have them that dayperhaps i will venture back in hopes of tasting that strange strange donuti have been here a few times due to its close proximity to where i live the pho and spring rolls are pretty good and the prices are ok the service however leaves something to be desired i have been told twice they were out of cilantro i love cilantro and basically use pho as a vessel for it today i was told they were out by my waiter so i decided to pack everything up and go home where the cilantro is plentiful then suddenly someone found some cilantro dude just didnt want to miss whatever was playing in his phone long enough to ask also they are right next to rouses where bunches cilantro is about a dollar i just dont get itthis is probably the worst place ive been to in a bit such potential wasted  as the concept is really nice  the woman who took our order  had the worst attitude we experienced quite a few issues  i spoke with the manager thomas who was a true processional  he listened to is and showed genuine care for our concerns  his courtesy and professional demeanor made me change my review from a 1 to a 3hey great place to get seafood but not very service driven literally had to drive over not once but twice to place an order for live crawfish because time and time again they will not answer their damn phone once inside i could still hear the phone ringing and no one attempting to answer it and it wasnt due to being inundated with customers here is a hint dont keep aggravating people because eventually they will find another place to go for me it is a proximity issue and they really do have a good selection and quality seafood but i am very turned off by businesses that believe that they dont have to try to service customerspeople make sure u clear a whole bunch of time in your appointment book the wait on a sunday afternoon was almost an hour and a half from walking in the door to getting my ice cream in hand my end of line wasnt at the door at the time so those people had to have waited longer   yes its brand new and theres nothing like it yet elsewise so theres the justification of the hype  at least i talked to everyone waiting in line around me  we were all in the same boat   it was really good when i finally got my order it was 11 kaka crunchy with nutella and cereal ice cream and my toppings were kit kat m and m and fresh strawberry my sauces were strawberry and caramel  im glad i tried it and the price was okay but still that wait wowthe food is good for santa barbara mediocre at best for la but the service is seriously lacking  i have been coming to this restaurant for years due in large part to the sheer lack of dining options in this town and have noticed a steady decline in the service given the restaurants outrageous prices the consistently rude condescending and apathetic staff is entirely atrocious and unacceptable for instance last night i made a specific request when ordering for the chef not to include a particular ingredient in my meal because of a food allergy lo and behold my food came out and of course had the ingredient i had begged them not to put in it rather than apologizing for the mistake the rude blonde waitress looked at me as if it were my fault and said well i made a note but they include it in the sauce so next time you should specify she went on to defend her mistake in a very condescending manner     bottom line horrendous service mediocre food and outrageous prices and its only getting worse   santa barbara needs more choices stative never seen a super center that is this small  it lacks a cohesive plus size clothing center  heck what used to be their plus wear is mostly clearance now  they do have a decent electronics department if you have an iphone a fairly ok selection of health  beauty  but this is mostly a walmart if you need to quick stop theres a real super center 20 minutes away on sr54 or just up the road on aldermantheir tacos were great but their sauce was poor and less than mediocre i asked for real mexican hot sauce and they gave me their homemade  stuff  you put second class sauce on a great taco and what do you get yep a second class tacofood  amazing well get the that in a minute  because there are so many great food options around especially this area the thing that sets places apart are their service   the first time i came to sofresh it was amazing erin greater me right away she asked if i had been there before and proceeded to explain the menu and the build your own options she made it so simple to figure out what i wanted and gave me so much info in such a professional way with tasteful humor here and there she seemed so passionate and genuine after i ordered she asked if i was new to the area and then explained the lunch card system somehow in todays society customer service has died a little erin reminded me how it should be she made me feels so comfortable and gave me an urge to want to come back   heres why i gave sofresh 3 starts instead of 5 april 7 2017i enjoyed my first experience so much that i had to bring my girlfriend back to show her this new amazing place i found the experience was nothing like the first we walked in the door and the girl at the counter didnt great us she continued do whatever it was she was doing i started to feel as if we were a bother and maybe should go finally the young blonde girl looked up and said hey then put something in her mouth and was chewing i again felt as if i was interrupting and didnt want to bother her while she was eating once i noticed she was done chewing i grabbed her attention she never asked us what we would like to order and began ordering my girlfriend began ordering and these two guys walked in her friends one guy screened this very loud sofresh jingle he i guess came up up with and immediately the young blonde girls attention was gone she kept looking at them and laughing and barely even listening to us making us repeat ourselves over and over then one guy took out his phone and took a picture with a flash he must have not known his flash was on and then started explaining he was taking a picture of her it made us feel very uncomfortable and it was as if he was taking a picture of us we are a sane sex couple and have experienced males tormenting us even if it wasnt us he was taking a picture of it still made us feel uncomfortable and the possibility of our picture going around with peoples awful comments then when we were trying to close out the order my girlfriend said shed like everything wrapped to go the girl started charging us for a wrap togo she again wasnt listening to us i saw erin come out and began asking her questions i wanted to make sure our order was right because i had such little faith in the young blonde girl plus as uncomfortable as i was i knew talking with erin and id feel a little more comfortable erin made sure i got everything correct with the anthonys i wanted on the side we decided to eat a little bit in the store and take the rest home though we should have left as we sat there and ate we saw erin work so hard she was refilling napkins cleaning tables and do all kinds of things she never stopped working the blonde girl sat there and talked with her friends who were very obnoxious we watched him swipe a cookie from the counter right in front of her and she did nothing then drunk people started coming in and thats when we said enough was enough why are people drunk at 8pm but thats another issue unrelated to this   now for the food oh my goodness it is amazing both times i have gotten the build your own bowl and i just cant handle how amazing it is everything is so refreshing its light and full of body fuel we came the second time after a workout and that salmon was orgasmic their seasoning isnt over the top its very simple just enough to taste and makes the everything go down easy   however after this horrible second experience we are very hesitant to returni had previously visited the depot for drinks and wanted to taste some dishes on their menu i ordered the pulled pork sandwich and was not impressed the meat lacked flavour and the barbecue sauce provided was less than ideal i felt the combination of the two was average at best on top of the sandwich the sweet potato fries were lacking in the sweet flavor i hoped to enjoy in all honesty i would stick to the brews on tap and come for happy hour drinkswe stopped in to earl of sandwich and it is really similar to a soup and sandwich chain that you would expect like panera   i got the combo with half sandwich and half soup and they were both fine i got the roastbeef with horseradish sauce food came out pretty quick and was standard slightly high mall prices  the regular sandwich looks like its definitely big enough for 2 people to sharei have now been to baileys range 4 times  each time i have ordered something different but all 4 times my medium burger has come over way over cooked  yesterday 3 of us ordered our burgers medium 1 came out medium rare and the other 2 were very well done  i am not one to send something back but it shocks me that a burger place cannot get the cook of a burger correct   that being said their fries are great and they have some of the best ice cream in the city which is why we have been several times nowemployees used to be always rude but i can say ive never had my order messed up i usually just get a junior bacon cheeseburger small fry and occasionally a small chocolate frosty ive been more recently and they have some new faces there finallyi come here semifrequently because of its proximity to my house   love they have a great selection of natural organic nonwheat food stuffs the stuff they sell is high quality and i havent been disappointed with anything they have a great food buffet in the back awesome natural medicine skin care etc section christina from christina cooks does demonstration classes here that i have been to great community message board  hate  the stuff they sell is freakin expensive sure the organic peppers are great but for 3 each ill go to the italian market and get 5 peppers for that price for that reason even though the produce always looks great i refuse to buy it there unless im desperate or its too cold to walk elsewherethey were out of multiple products i waited almost an hour for an egg sandwich and yet someone who ordered 20 min after me got their food food was good though and he did apologize for my wait although it shouldnt take almost an hour for foodon our first stop of a 72 hour whirlwind pch drive we stopped in santa barbara for lunch  we love the beach the water seafood so what better place to eat than the wharf right  well  i forgot how much i dislike the smells of a pierwharf  the seafood was decent though  we got the special abalone and a crab sandwich to share  the abalone was pretty good lightly battered and fried with some delist tomato basil rice  i never realized how meaty abalone is  and it was a good thing that there was a good amount of abalone because the crab sandwich was kinda pathetic  there was barely any crab meat  and for over 12 there better be huge crab chunks to make this girl happy  overall go with the days specials  because the regular menu items are probably not worth itthis has a lot of potential but unfortunately falls short in a town thats regarded highly when it comes to cuban food the chicken bowl was very basic over salted and overpricedive been here twice and both times they have gotten my order wrong  first time they gave me the wrong bahn mi  i didnt notice it until i got home  the second time i dined in and got the chicken curry with a boba and received the wrong boba  they offered to get me another but said its fine  the bahn mi was average  they gave me i believe the pork so it was slightly on the dry side  the curry was average also as the sauce was missing that depth in  flavor of a good curry sauce but hey this is a fast food type place so i wasnt expecting anything more  i will return to try some more of their drink offeringsold church converted to coffee shoprestaurant in down town eagle newly remodeled and much more modern than before staff is very friendly and attentive they have your normal coffee selections and pasties in the counter displays  there is a separate restaurantsitting area for dinning or having your coffee at a table  i want to really like this place but there are a few things that made me give them 3 stars for now one wait time it took us 30 minutes to get a table for 2 on sunday morning i get that it is post church and probably the busiest time of the weekstill dont like to wait that long 2nd tried ordering a meal off the menu for first time and the chile relleno quiche sounded good the quich was good but i was told it was layered with chilies saw a few diced pieces and covered in red sauce had a dollop in any event it tasted like a quiche with a little ranchero sauce guess i expected more flavor i will try rembrandts again and give them another shot but probably not on a sunday afternoonthe kinks need to be worked out the service was not good i can forgive that as it was very busy and they are still getting started the drinks however werent that good the bartender needs helps and like he was extremely overwhelmed almost like he didnt know how to make their own cocktails  they only have like 3   the decor isnt complete either overall it just needs work  make the whole place feel like a laboratory get a couple skeletons maybe bunson burners for the tables servers wear lab coats periodic table behind the bar science posters framed own your uniqueness   i was very excited about this place and will definitely give it another shot in about 23 months and see if the kinks have been worked out   its a 3 star because like i mentioned they are brand new the owners have never been in the service industry i dont believe and i have hope itll get bettervery basic little shop on the harbor was looking for coffee nearby before getting back in the car and saw the sign outside that said coffee ok well its not starbucksits just drip coffee but if thats what youre looking for theyve got it and most other things you would find at a gas station conventient storegreat addition to manayunk prices are a little steep considering it is only manayunknot center city  i love fro yo and get it a bunch when i am in the city  staff was friendly minus the owner who was plugging away on his computer and didnt even look updont you think you should  be as energetic as your employees saying hello to all who walk inespecially since we are paying customersthis used to be my spot now that they took truffle mac off the menu i have no reason to go anymore  i have tried some of the new stuff and nothing compares i just dont understand how something can go from being a signature dish to not on the menu at allgood service theres a walk up window in addition to the sit in restaurant its at the end of the pier so the view is nice the food wasnt great  onion rings panko breeding with no seasoning no flavor clam chowder thin but great flavor box crab fine crab cakes inedible all breading and corn meal overly hard no meat we had to go somewhere else for my sister because they were so badyou have to know what youre getting yourself into when you come here  what i mean by that is are they expensive  yes do they have a lot and i mean a lot of beers  yes do they sell a lot of crafts and beers you cant find at most places  yes can you customize your own 6packs  yes do they have a deli where you can scarf down a sandwich and have a cold one  yes i havent had any sandwiches but heard theyre good do they have wifi so you can work from home at the foodery  yes did you forget if theyre pricey  yes are they on instagram  yes do they have specials and showcase different breweries  yes are they open late  yes  that is what they are  not a true deli not a true beer store not a grocery story  theyre your neighborhood goto spot for people who know nothing about beer to the people who consider themselves beer snobs  there are often tastingssamples of different beer and there is almost always some sort of special going on  overall its a solid place and a staple in our neighborhood especially in an area with so many byobsi do not know what the fuss about this place okay it is big they have variety of food mostly international foods the deli is packed but they sell boars head products like publix  i had the sesame tuna sandwich which was ok i also tried hot italian sandwich and it was also ok their bread is pretty good good beer and wine selection again this place sells no different stuff than publix just little better decoration thats allmaybe i was just too excited to try this place out but it fell short of my expectations  we arrived around 5306pm on a saturday night and put our names on the wait list  we were already kind of hungry so we ordered an appetizer from the togo line to snack on  while we were waiting they announced that they had ran out of lobster rolls  what it was like 6pm dinner rush had barely started  it was the sole reason my friend wanted to come needless to say she was highly disappointed  theres a of little shops on the wharf so if the wait is long theres plenty to explore downside is they dont tell you how long the wait is not even a rough estimate  my friends and i wanted to check out the candy shop so we asked them about how long we still had he gave us a really vague answer about how we could be up next or maybe another 20 minutes he didnt know  thanks   after we were seated we ended up getting a clam chower bowl 2 crab sandwiches and a lobster linguini  everything was average  not someplace id recommendthis place gets three stars for their amazing shakes way overpriced and for the goat cheese salad that i had  there cucumber ranch is fantastic    the interior is very modern and interesting  there is a long table when you walk in that can have you sit as though you are eating european style next to a stranger  they have fresh flowers on the tables and if you eat downstairs you can watch every aspect of the kitchen including washing dishes    the hamburgers are lacking flavor and their house ketchups are disgusting also lacking flavor  if you do however want a bison lamb any kind of meat burger this is the place for you  the pepperjack goat cheese is very peppery almost too much to eat for my taste  if you are downtown and want to pay for a 1215 burger this is the place for you   if you are downtown and want a great shake that is chunky this is a great stopthis small outpost of manhattan bagel is relatively wellrun and offers the same choices as other manhattan bagels and decent coffee for 159 for a small  not my favorite  but ok for a quick morning bagel or coffee runi used to love coming here i work around the corner and it was super easy to duck around for a quick burger the cooks are awesome they remember me every time theyre friendly and they know how to make a great burger cooked to a perfect mediumrare unfortunately the points off are for the guys at the counter i think one of them is the owner he always looks like he doesnt want to be there i dont think ive ever seen him smile and hes been cranky at customers on numerous occasions the other counter guy either has a hard time hearing or doesnt care enough to try kind of a problem in a place that gets so loud i had to repeat my order twice and then my name three times last visit i just ordered a shake my order was finally filled after 20 minutes of listening to these two guys get short with customers a girl whod ordered guacamole didnt see it on her receipt and brought it up with the guy who said you didnt say that you wanted guacamole  great its good to know that if theres ever a problem with my order its my fault  i wish i could give more than three because the cooks are seriously awesome and know their way around a grill but the two jerks taking orders really mess up the experiencemixed feeling   after driving for more than 5 hrs on the treacherous highway80 from bay area to reno  we spent more than 2 hrs near truckeedonner area  parking alike chainsuv required because of the snow storming condition we were so happy the 101 is still open unfortunately we encountered a very inpatient waitress who seemed so disappointed of seeing us walking in 20 minutes before 9pm closing time thankfully she realized it was not a right attitude towards the late customers and quickly reminded the kitchen not to shut the stove off later the two delicious noodles were presented to us deliciously were amazed how fast the food  were served after a few quick bites and noticed so many staffs were leaving the restaurant we decided to help them and not to delay any further by asking for doggy bags to go the sour veggie with pork noodle was delectable as expected the half beeftendon was tender but a bit salty but still very good id still recommend this restaurantdecent flavor and service below average ambiance and location  its a great idea to integrate cheesecake the peanut butter cheesecake works particularly wellgood indian place but unfortunately not as good as the lawrenceville nj location  i would recommend it but if you are passionate about indian food make the drive to central jerseyi dont gamble and i certainly dont smoke the only reason i come here is for the food ive been to council oak steakhouse rock n raw sushi and fresh harvest great service and food each and every visit i will go into further detail on each restaurant in their own separate reviews for this review its based on the combination of my prior visits to the restaurants and my stay in one of their rooms the room was nonsmoking which was a nice change from all the smoke downstairs extremely disgusting for us nonsmokers i dont enjoy my hair and nice clothes smelling like ive been rolling around in cigarettes they really need a nonsmoking casino area but anywaysthe room was clean modern and upscale they add little touches here and there which makes your stay special a bonus if youre a frequent casino goer is that they offer free rooms depending on how much you play too bad they dont offer the same deal for us foodies  the hard rock is fun to go to if you have the right crowd or are easily entertained by the games for me its about the food and endless oystersstill have yet to get our food smells good and looks good wish i could taste dont come here in your last day or if you have limited timei shop at pathmark bc it is super close to my house i dont own a car and its dirt cheap i would absolutely recommend this supermarket for the everyday sort of items or those you typically stock up on  canned goods toiletries paper items household cleaners dry goods etc there are amazing deals all the time on the things we useconsume the most often the place is relatively clean although once someone snuck their little rat dog in and it pooped in a shopping cartonto the floor in the frozen section and it was not cleaned up right away at all  and they left the cart w poop and all right there for everyone to walk by and gag  if its produce youre trying to buy iovines in the reading terminal market is even cheaper for 100x better quality products however the produce isnt horrid here either i would never buy seafood or meat here  items like purdue chickenturkey where you know the items have been packaged securely and cannot be reopened are ok the deli counter is the slowest this side of the masondixon and i have encountered several employees who have mispriced cold cuts make sure you check their work i even had one experience where the guy yelled at me for not telling him it was on sale he specifically said how am i suppose to know whats on sale all the time ummmmm yeah so customer service is definitely not enforced in the store  not to say that every employee is a jerk   sometimes items marked on sale in the circular arent marked on sale on the shelf  i usually forgo the items especially on large trips when i often forget to make sure the prices come up correctly at the register never go on thursdays  the aisles are a mess w new products and price stickers go missing bc new sales start on fridays by sunday most items on sale have not been restocked from the weekend masses either   if you are bringing your own bags dont use the self check out lines the scales are retarded and the employees arent usually the most observant or even locatable when you need assistance   if you ride a bike like me and typically can only buy what you can carry on your back there is a bike rack and other poles and such available to lock up to  never had a problem with thatwent for sunday brunch and its an all you can eat buffet its 1516 per person not impressed with the food i know its hard to keep things warm on a buffet but a lot of it was pretty bleh the best thing at the buffet was the smoked salmon and the reggiano potatoesi have been driving pass this store front restaurant and food truck for about a year now and decided to stop in the restaurant is nice and even have an outside space in the rear for u to dinein they serve alcohol beverages to go with ur mealhmmm did not expected itbut i came for the friesi did the base fries because this was my first time but how can u go wrong with potatoesthey were very good a bit priceybut i will return to elevate my taste budsloltwice in a row now theyve called me back after 30 minutes to tell me they are out of something i hate that i love them i dont want to resort to third party delivery apps i like oldschool deliverythree and a half stars clean bathrooms great service from our bartender sean the barback tried to dissuade me from attempting their notveryadvertised challenge even as he shucked my oysters live music some evenings my cocktail was on the sweeter side of okay so i ended up sticking to the conservative beer list smoked fried oysters were plated on a leaf of butter lettuce with a pool of garlic aioli and i barely got a hint of smoke flavor even when eaten naked i was more pleased with the fried chicken livers that were served on a bed of bacon marmalade to minimize texture phobia good crunch on both menu items future hit list house made gator sausage pork butt tamale spiced oyster taco chicken  house made andouille gumbo shrimp  roasted eggplant soup shrimp  grits fishermans stew  food challenge 12 local oysters with a heaping tablespoon of their hottest beaver horseradish on each to be eaten in 60 seconds without aid of a beverage reward upon completion one free beer the oysters get comped and a hilarious tshirt in your size that says i ate hot beaver at grand isle status completed 60 seconds advice dont eat dinner beforehand dont chew too thoroughly and be prepared for ten minutes of hyperactive tear gland production fifteen minutes of initial regret before you start mumbling that it was totally worth it nigh disrespectful to the tasty oysters to down them that fast an hour of tummy cramps and fermented burps to followit was ok but i wont be back they treat their white customers waaayyy better than their black customers and keep in mind the owner and all the staff are black i walked in behind two white guys and the lady serving the food explained to them with great gusto the food options of the day another lady passed by and joked with them its my turn and im excitedly expecting the same treatment the lady serving the food looks at me with a bored look on her face and mumbles what do you want i was taken aback i had never been there before so i asked her to tell me what were the dishes of the day she wasnt helpful at all and didnt recommend anything while i was eating my food it became even more apparent that the black ladies were treating the white customers much better than the black customers white people would walk through the door and they were greeted black customers including myself walked through the door and we got zero greetings they were also super friendly and jokey with the white customers in general it was a very awkward experience because i felt like even the white guys were looking and noticing the very different treatment i was getting as a black woman it was not a welcoming experience at all it was so unwelcoming that i wont be back quite embarrassing  with regards to the food i was not impressed at all it was all very ok the flavors were ok the ice cream was too sweet and not creamy i got the praline ice cream i prefer for my food to have more texture everything was sort of mushybread pudding grits mac  cheese and okra gumbo didnt feel like i was getting too many vitamins plus it was hard to believe it was all vegan would help if they listed the ingredients in their dishesexactly like every other 7 eleven ive ever been to was a penny cheaper than anywhere else around today so you better believe i am banking that savingsi had super high hopes for this place the interior and exterior design is amazing this place is beautiful the brunch was okayi got the chicken breakfast tacos and there was some salsa in them that tasted sour i mean i ate them but i wouldnt get them again my fiance got the corn beef hash with poached eggs it was good hash except the eggs were not in anyway poached the oysters were great the service was great the ambiance was great i think i just didnt order the best thing i will definitely try againif you are a big fan of tired hands beer then youll love this spot its a large industrial space with their beer tanks on display but it gets crowded and very noisy sometimes service can be spotty too the food is an eclectic mix of unusual tacos and other fare and is pretty good if you dont drink beer your limited to one choice of red or white wine or water personally i find the original tired hands pub better and their bread cannot be beat the beer list is the same toopros   fast service fresh food interesting twists on creole standards  cons pricey po boys french fries need work recipe duration  its expensive because theyre paying strip mall rent in a hightraffic neighborhood i can understand thatwe attempted to get coffee at the french quarter location a few times while in new orleans but the lines are so obscene it was a failed effort alas we headed to metarie to partake in this new orleans tradition of chicory and beignets  i had an iced cafe au lait and it was sweet perfection im not much of a sweet tooth but i had to at least taste the beignetswhen in rome they were tasty and lighter than i expected with the perfect amount of sugar i made the rookie mistake of attempting to eat one while wearing a black shirt beignet failill admit ive only eaten here once since i moved into the area a year and a half ago but im always tempted to try it again  i just  uh  havent   maybe i feel theres always something better to get or i forget about it  i wasnt all that impressed but the food was okay actually  i called and had some food ordered for a pickup    on the phone i asked about the hotness of their wings  see i like a little spicy but not a lot  i like the flavor of hot sauce and chicken and a bit of heat  but im not a fan of needing a fire hose either  so anyhow i asked and she said they do different heat levels  i asked for the mildest hot wings  i also ordered a chicken burger for my wife which was supposed to come with a large ortega chili roasted on it  when picking up the food the atmosphere was okay  they had a few locals that were drinking there but otherwise it was very empty  i kind of felt out of place  when getting home and digging in to our food the first thing i realized was  my mouth was on fire  like omg why is satan dancing on my tongue  i pushed through it though  the flavor of the sauce and the chicken was there and i appreciated that the wings werent scrawny  good meat on each of em  but the heat  dear lord the heat  somehow i did it i finished them all but i would regret it the rest of the night  oh i forgot i also had a cheeseburger  there wasnt anything special with it it was rather ordinary  certainly not bad though  my wifes chilichicken burger was okay i had a bite but lacking some flavor  my wife commented on it too  she said the ortega chili was mostly tasteless but the chicken itself was alright  thats about it  i dont have much else to say  i really should eat there again try some different things  ill have to remember theyre there  ps they often have some sweet cars sitting outside their place  hot vettes vws woodys etc  love driving by therei have a certain lovehate relationship with baileys range it has a lot of positive qualities but theres also plenty of negatives ive been here twice with the beautiful wife so its time to write a review rather than writing some gripping story lets just hit some points ill also say that this could have just as easily been a 4 star review but for the price ill keep it at three  the good 1 weve only been here in the evening for dinner but service has been really good weve also sat upstairs both times more about that later we also appreciated a visit by gene bailey manager and brother of owner dave where we were able to give some feedback  2 the two burgers that ive had pbj pesto goat cheese tomato jam on a bison patty and the ozark ozark mushrooms caramelized onions and goat cheese have both been great lots of lots with a good amount of toppings  3 the flavor of the shakes  weve had the irish coffee delicious and the sweet sweet bacon bourbon candied bacon salted caramel ice cream if youre a fan of pulp fiction youll remember vincent commenting about the 5 milkshake do they put bourbon in this one oh yes they do and is this a good milkshake nay its a a pretty fucking good milkshake  4 the beer list  theyre keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap  5 the house made pickles and catsup the fries the smoked onion rings  i enjoyed all of them  the not so good  1 price  especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages you can rack up some stupid bills the two times weve been there weve ended up with hefty bills with tip over 90 each time i guess if youre a lets split a burger an order fries and have one soda each type of couple youll be able to walk out of there for 20 but youre not much fun either so live with that  2 the consistency of the shakes  id put the irish coffee shake up there with anything that kota or the fountain offers but at baileys range theyre just too thin i know that kota bought some uber shake machine and while im not buying one for them at some point they should upgrade  3 the cheese curds  i like cheese curds but admittedly i expected fried cheese curds instead these are fresh so wisconsinites youve been warned  4 the rest of the alcoholic drink menu  just havent been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered for instance the bermuda is pretty much a dark  stormy with passion fruit nectar but as presented all you tasted was the passion fruit other drinks tasted more fruitylight but then again when youve gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time its probably my palate  5 the carolina burger topped with smoked pork shoulder house bbq sauce sweet  spicy slaw was so drenched in bbq sauce that you couldnt taste anything else the sauce was wonderful but if you really want this burger get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on  i really want to love baileys range  but that doesnt mean that i hate it more that i was hoping it would be a place where wed go on a tuesday night when we dont feel like cooking instead it feels more like a well come here once a monthso i am a boba snob i grew up in the bay area and by far i think the best taro milk tea comes from fantasia they use real taro and its not that lilac purple like places that use powder  look at some taro some day it is off white  anyways no one does real taro milk tea and bings is no exception i was really hoping they might since they are next to a huge asian supermarket where they can buy some taro but alas they use the purple powder stuff  i got a regular milk tea and something just wasnt right with it  not sure if theyre using a powdered tea for that too  it didnt taste like brewed tea for sure and i make a better milk tea at home with trader joes unsweetened black tea and some half and half  however ill give them props for knowing how to cook the boba really well  i just hope they arent buying boba from next door in lee lees because their boba comes from china which really the rule should just be dont buy anything processed or manufactured in china if youre going to consume it  if their boba comes from taiwan i will return a lot more often  i forgot to ask when i was there but ill double check next time  they were a little on the slow side an original milk tea shouldnt take almost 10 minutes to put together but they have a huge selection if youre into slushes and snows and they rotate seasonal flavors i guess  only time can tell if i end up craving bings when im all done with workordered poopoo plater for myselfinsert joke here it was very good the lo mein was boring its not fancy its a basic takeout jointnot many togo choices in terminal d all of them are pretty bad so get something to eat before you enter the terminal if possible  if you are unfortunately already stuck in the terminal and dont have time for a sit down meal i recommend cheesecake scoop for a quick bite they have readymade wraps and salads the shrimp louis sandwich was good i was worried about the quality of shrimp but it was fine they didnt give me enough salad dressing  which looks like a thick thousand island  i suppose they are better known for their unique way of serving cheescake  scooped and served into a cup the idea is cool but i have yet to try itive been wanting to try this bakery for a while after seeing the incredible pictures on their website i finally was able to stop in when i was in the city i was pretty disappointed at how limited the selection was everything i asked for they claimed was at other locations or they didnt have i opted for the carrot cake and eclair which were both yummy but nothing extraordinarythe food was really good and the waitress was very kind but i cant help but feel that the structure of the kitchen needs to be worked in the food didnt come together there were multiple mistakes with our orders and the waitress kept apologizing it could be either of the cook or waitresss fault but regardless i probably wouldnt come here by choice again the food did taste good it just took a very long time to come to the tablenot bad for a brazilian steakhouse in tampa if this were in a city such as chicago or san francisco where there are more brazilian steakhouses this would probably be average or below average  ive been there two times so far and i find that their salad bar which includes smoked salmon cheeses and some warm items is more exciting than their meat selections  of course youre coming here for the meat and id rate the meat quality and taste 75  80 out of 10    i was disappointed to learn that boizao does not serve plantains instead they serve breaded fried banana  my guess is that they do this because bananas are much cheaper     they also do not serve baked pineapple which is purported to have enzymes to help with digesting meat  if they can add plantains and pineapple id give it 4 stars    for dinner expect to spend at least 60 dollars a personthis is a beautiful hotel the ambiance is very romantic and quaint the hotel sits right in the heart of the french quarter and is within easy walking distance to all of the tourist sites and other notable locations within the city the hotel does offer a continental breakfast that is not bad for what it is its pretty much the standard fare of eggs pancakes sausage bacon potatoes or grits depending on the day they also have a wide selection of other breakfast items should you not like the hot food choices the rooms are elegant and cozy but are a little on the small side which is fine i also greatly appreciated that the floors were marble or some facsimile which meant you did not have to worry about what may be living in the carpet of the room it is a decent place to stay but i think the negatives do out weigh the positives  so what are the negatives first off if you have a rental car you will need to pay a huge fee of 36 dollars a day in order to have it parked for you it is true that the hotel is very good about getting the car for you when you need it and then parking it again when you are done where the shock with the parking comes from the fact that you are charged a tax on each of those days that it has been parked so in reality the parking of the care is not 36 but 40 dollars a day this is something that really needs to be placed on their website so that people know the second really bad thing was the housekeeping we came bake early one of the days and the room was not completed so the housekeeper asked us if we could wait we said it was no problem at all and for her to take her time well she made up the room but took a huge shortcut on making the bed the bed has a duvet on it and instead of putting the duvet in a cover she just wrapped it in two sheets so we had they nasty duvet touching our skin because she neglected to give us a sheet to use to cover our selves we also noted that the headboard seems to never get dusted or cleaned as we found some disgusting stuff on top of it the alarm clock in the room is very dated and while it is mentioned that you can use an ipod for your alarm that will only work if you have the older version of the ipod it is not able to use the newer ones the last thing that really upset us is that we booked our vacation on travelocity as a package so we know that the room was at a discounted rate we felt like we were penalized for this because we were placed in this back area that seemed like it was empty except for us and we had to walk up and down 25 stairs to get to and from our room it was not until the weekend that we noticed others that were also placed in the back area with us and one guest was so upset with the bedding that they threw it outside their room   all in all it was an okay hotel but not one that i would check into againclean and semiempty on july 4 during their limited opening hours got the 3 frap promo of double fudge bar for me and caramel waffle cone for the friend the caramel waffle cone was too sweet for my liking and same with the double fudge bar such have stuck with my usual green tea frap but this is the point of these 3frap promofor you to try something out of your comfort zone  anyway the milks were empty and i placed them at the starbucks counter and notified the staff to replaced them after 30 minutes they did no such thing at least they have nice tables where you can do your laptop work but no plugs near the tablesmore than just ice cream  the place is ok  i mean it is nothing to rave on about  it is a decent consistent place that has been a staple in philadelphia for years     turkey burger  probably one of the best you can get  chicken salad sandwich  very good cosmopolitan salad  seriously needs an update deserts  are once again ok   we recently had their over priced pumpkin pie and it was decent    also the waiters there seem to be on another planet some days   will i go again  yes it is a nice place to meet and grab a quick meal or ice cream  bathrooms were not cleanthis place is decent for fruits veggies some grains and international snacks the food court is also alright but it really depends on the time of day every time i go here i always see and smell rotten meat  beef pork and fish  so i would never trust the meat from this place the aisles are small and if its busy people tend to be pushy and inconsiderate if you know when the down times are then try to plan your visit around then its bad enough that the parking lot for this shopping centre is always chaotic so there is a good chance you wont get a break from that once you get insidewould only suggest coming here for a beer or when its slower good beer but really slow service and just average foodgiving 3 stars i have been there 3 times 1st time would be 5 stars 2nd time 3 stars and 3rd time 1 star 1st time we ate there but 2nd and 3rd we had takeout i strongly suggest do not do takeout and if you do check your food this last time im glad i did i ordered cornbread and they gave me a really nasty looking old biscuit i ordered an add on of burnt ends and there was 4 small pieces wth i went back in and manager corrected the mistake but he acted like it was no big deal this was a to go order it has to be right i also received a smoked jalapeo with no bacon on it on 2nd visit overall good food if your order is correcti was mildly disappointed by my visit here let me just say that service was great and the venue was awesome my issue was the food i didnt expect full on authentic latin foodi expected authentic tasting modern latin dishes and taste just isnt there i ordered empanadas and that is where i stopped i would still go back for the bar and food but not for latin foodfood was tasty but i was very disappointed that yelp had them on the list of gluten free pancakes and they do not have gluten free pancakes if i would have stood in the long line that is usually here i would have been pissed yelp needs to change their information so those with celiac who are craving pancakes wont be crying in their eggs like i am nowdecent bbq chicken panini that had bacon for free but lettuce tomatoes and onions cost extra seems a bit odd note a 7 minimum for a credit card and with a vitamin water my total was just north of 10ive always had such mixed feelings about bu  i so wanted to like bu to support a local chain to enjoy the quirky environs and the moderately inventive offerings but i think im finally done  last night was probably the last visit to bu well make for a while  my boyz and i all left a little queasy after the greasy fried mushrooms and onion rings  we were hungry they tasted good while they were hot but we all acknowledged while we were eating them they were overly greasy and oily  bu has never really gotten the fried part right and last night was the final straw for us  the fried food seems to always be soaked in oil  last night it was overwhelming and just too heavy for us all  were not wilting lillys when it comes to meat and fat but even for us it was a bit much and the the oil smelled a bit old  service is always spotty which tells me there isnt consistent training and it was spotty last night  i ordered a turkey patty with my wedge and was given a full blown turkey sandwich not even sure i was charged for it i was tired and didnt want to even pursue it  whatever  our server was nice and had a great attitude but he left us sitting for a long time and then the food runners didnt know who had ordered what   message for bu wait staff  its pretty darned simple to take 5 seconds before you get to the table to figure out who ordered what  ive waited tables before and have been helped by my fellow wait staff we got organized ahead of arriving at the table  i also didnt force my customers to scramble to reorganize the table settings while i stood waiting laden down with hot food  dont make your customers do that  that move really gets up my nose  you can prepare for thatyour customers want to relax dont stress them out trying to help you bc you were ill prepared to deliver the food  so the good part the food isnt bad but its inconsistent  last night my husband and boys had great burgers on gluten free buns  they were perfectly cooked midrare the buns were tasty and not dry at all    but that wont be enough to bring us back  we need a break from bu to let us forget the mixed results the queasy feeling in our stomachs from too much grease and the sense that im overpaying for amateurish staff  bus homemade ketchup is very tasty  so is the dipping sauce for the fries as well as the mustard aioli which i use on my salad  its like honey mustard  the fries are always soggy and are served in a stainless steel cup which just makes them even more soggy   sigh  goodbye for a while buthis is a typical giant my favorite part is that there is a giant gas outside so i can use my reward points to get gas after i finish my grocery shopping the only annoying part of the giant is that their produce is not always fresh so sometimes i make a trip to another store to purchase produceid like to start by saying it wasnt bad by any means but there is certainly much better mexican food in area i gave two thumbs up for their homemade chips as they were delicious  the salsa was pretty good too i had the vegetarian enchiladas it seemed like it was just a tortilla wrapped with sparse veggies the enchilada sauce just ehh i wouldnt say i would never go back again because id be up to trying something else on their menu for right now i just give it 3 starsits hard to find a good doner kebab  dooners has great fresh ingredients and equipment to make the proper doner  they a variety of menu options to that to make things interesting  the use of naan bread in different combinations with kebab meat is an interesting spin from the usual doner kebab joint  the owner is afghan and lived in germany where he picked up the diner kebab art  have had a couple of issues with employees who are either new or untrained  they were not familiar with what portion size proper use of equipment ie how to pour a beer or the menu  in one case i ordered a hummus salad and got no hummus  the employees are always friendly  a big negative is that they do not shave the portion of meat directly from the spit as is traditionally done  instead they shave it and put it on a heater in the food prep area this leaves the meat less flavorful  an employee told me that it was a health department regulation but it makes no sense of why that would be any more sanitary the same shaver is being used in any case     in general i feel that the portion size is small compared to other doner shops and the price is on the high side   downtown st petersburg needs another doner shop to get some healthy competition goinggood mexican food at a fair price wait staff could be a little more friendly looks like they are almost finished remodeling the restaurant which looks very nicevery slow and they leave items behind the counter so you dont know if your order is ready i had waited 15 minutes for a large soup that was done prior to me coming up to the counter they kept putting items up on the counter but the soup was not one of them normally they announce the numbers each time they put items up on the counterive been here a couple of times with some of my friends who live in the area  boy is this place popular on a saturday night  a great vibe and place to try many different craft beers if that is what you are into  they do have a limited wine menu but no liquor if that is more to your liking  parking is a bit of a pain so be prepared to either get there early walk risk having to park far away or get towedwhoa its loud in there went for a business lunch and we could barely hear each other food is good gluten feee crust is good its a cute place and i will probably be back due to the location of my officethis place wasnt bad but compared to doma vics or other sushi places its not that great the best thing we had was the soft shell crab appetizer which had a really good lobster sauce sushi and fish were decentout of all the steakhouses in the area i must say this one isnt the best but it will do for someone who loves steak and on a tight budget the steak are hearty and cook to ur preference the portions are big enough to satisfy your hunger and enough to take home to enjoy laterthere are an even amount of pros and cons to luigis   pros  service is quick staff is friendly the menu has good variety sandwiches are decent good with custom orders  cons  food is inconsistent one week wed have a great pie the next week it was undercooked  fries are always soggy for some reason  tables are rarely cleaned in the restaurant itself  you need to clean them yourself    its good in a pinch but not somewhere id drive longer than 10 minutes to go totook my wife here for our anniversary based on so many 5 star reviews i am guessing many of these are based on the owner and staff who are really quite lovely people   but a review is about food and i was not overly impressed no fresh spring rolls on the menu  fried tofu was overdone the fried egg rolls were okay if a little over cooked as well not off to a great start   there are no small portions of tom yum or tom ka soups both start at 995  my papaya salad was not the freshest but did have a nice fermented quality   our entrees were chicken pad thai and chicken drunken noodles very standard fare based on prior thai food consumption we both got mild to avoid scorching our mouth out and they were extra mild and honestly really bland   the pad thai was served without peanuts and was lacking in the typical sweet and sour zing drunken noodles were better but the sauce was lacking depth and dimension   we want to love this place but with so many other dining options to chose from i doubt well be back anytime soonthis place was super cute inside and it didnt take too long to get my ice cream made i got my ice cream with coconut and strawberry mixed in i couldnt see the strawberry at all i had probably 1 or 2 bites where i could actually taste the strawberry there was waaaaaaay too much coconut as well it was basically like eating spoonfuls of shaved coconut way more coconut than ice cream for sure i got a nutella drizzle which was just one circle around the cup definitely only like 2 bites worth the marshmallows on top were suuuper good they toast them before adding them to the ice cream i try not to give bad star ratings but i was just really disappointed with the ice cream for over 6 i would not be backthree stars because ive had bad experiences in the past with them any time i ordered the food almost never was all in my bag when id leave and one employee was very very very rude at the window when i told her the beans she gave me was literally all sauce and not one bean was in the cup but seems they have been improving which is why ill give 3 stars and not 1 ive spent the past three years poking my head into bakeries around town hoping to find someplace that makes german rye bread with caraway seeds ive often been told they dont make it or that its sold out or that its on the baking schedule for one weekend a month i had almost given up when i decided to check out breadland i was at the registry anyway so why not  i didnt even look at everything they offered i immediately asked the salesperson if their rye contained caraway and she answered in the affirmative i purchased a 5 loaf squeeing all the while about having finally found real rye bread in edmonton im pretty sure the woman thought i was crazy and the best news is that they make it every day  as soon as i got out the door i had to gnaw off a piece to make sure it was true it was once my excitement had passed and i was able to evaluate the bread in an objective fashion i decided it needed more caraway seeds otherwise it was pretty damn good upon arriving home hubs was really excited too we consumed the entire loaf in one eveningthis is my 4th time touring the brewery and had to bring the boyfriend while here on vacation the tour was interesting as usual very cool to see the different stages of the brewing process and our tour guides emma and mackenzie were helpful and funny very entertaining we did see the clydesdales but only from afar last few trips we were able to get up close while in the stable you do get free samples with the tour which is also free so you cant complain but i do remember you used to get several glasses at the end not just one you also get a small plastic cup about 12 way through the tour overall a mustsee for the newbies in town great experience not to be missedthe food here is pretty good nothing too special and the service is hit and miss the frozen custard is great the fries are greati ordered their for the first time the food was good the only thing the mac and cheese taste like the edges from the pan a burnt taste and the smoothered pork chops was good just to much fat but everything else was very flavorful i would give them another tryi ate here with brunch on the last morning in town before heading back home this is a pretty popular spot for brunch and given the small space youll likely have to wait a little bit of time before getting seated there was about a 1520 minute wait before our group of 5 got seated which considering the tiny space was not all that bad it has a bit less charm than other spots in the french quarter and it does feel a little bit divey our waiter was alright but he didnt understand my question about orange juice and somehow my hashbrowns were forgotten entirely when my big easy breakfast was brought out everyone else ordered the same dish and it included them  speaking of our food the big easy breakfast is pretty much what youd expect a standard breakfast to be  pancakes eggs breakfast meats home fries and toast its relatively cheap but the food is quite average the pancakes were a bit overcooked with the outside being a bit overcrisped and dark the eggs were overeasy  hard to do wrong  and the home fries were a tad buttery but pretty solid toast  quite bland the sausage was decently flavored but the bacon was a tad undercooked  its possible that the more regional brunch dishes are betterprepped and more representative of the local cuisine but the food was pretty average overall i would come back if there wasnt a line and wanted some standardissue brunch cuisine but i dont think i would wait in line again if i had the choicei was expecting to be wowed but just wasnt i ordered the chicken tenders with macncheese and cornbread the chicken and macncheese were okay  cornbread was very good my husband ordered a burger the char on his burger made it taste like charcoal sauce on it was very good though  the service was excellent people were extremely friendly plenty of seating and a relaxed atmospherei did try to go here twice when i was in philly however i must stay the food was buffet and it didnt look too appealing at all and i believe they had one seitan dish each time needless to say i stopped in twice and the food didnt look appealing at all so i never tried it i just wanted to share my opinion however i will say they had a very nice coop connected to it with excellent choices35  i really like this store if you can get past the fact that almost everyone in here is uber earthy crunchy probably wears soy underwear and bought a prius before gas prices started to climb because it was a smart thing to do not a trendy thing to do  i just cant get over the prices though  a friend of mine was kind enough to send me a 100 gift certificate so off i go gleefully ready to splurge on something that i wouldnt have normally spent  on  but my cheap radar went bonkers and after almost an hour in the store oohing and aahing over the variety of items here i walked away with only a handful of items from the meats and cheese department a bottle of olive oil and i think a dr bronners bottle and my bill came to 9777  owwww  afterwards i had asked some friends to meet me here for lunch at the food bar thinking id have plenty of  left on the gift card to treat them  for 3 of us sharing plates it was 43 with drinks  owwwwdont go after 7pm the staff cant keep up with the customer traffic theyre always short staffedwe went there last weekend basically we wanted to try something new so we just searched the area for high rated places and this place was one of them when we went there for a friday it was pretty quite im not sure how a high rated place can be quite on a friday but i have to assume they may get most of the customers for lunch the guy who greeted us and took our order was nice and polite and asked us have we ever been there he explained everything and we picked pulled pork the meat was ok however there was nothing special about it the sides were cold and probably left over from lunch and to be honest not a very satisfying experience the atmosphere was ok signs were hand written on paper attached to the wall i liked the sitting area and the windowsa decent bagel for florida cannot complain great coffee tooso i decided that i would visit this new establishment on its opening day being from the area i knew that this business is in a building that once housed a kfc so i expected to see remnants from the prior occupant although there were a couple things inside that looked similar much had changed i grabbed a printed menu to step back out of the way and give a go through decent sized menu that is mainly sticks to chicken but also has a small offering of wraps burritos and tacos i ordered three different types of chicken off the menu the first choice was fried chicken which was juicy had a almost homemade taste to it which i like the breading is of the  seafood batter variety chicken strips were my second chicken item breading seemed to be the same but darker in color chicken was again very juicy one downfall is the side of one chicken strip had some bones still attached my third menu item were the buffalo wings large spicy and cooked properly all in all i enjoyed the food and would give it a four the service was a bit so and a few mistakes were made but its the first day so its too be expected and id give that a two im sure theyll get the kinks worked out if i was asked if id visit this place again i would say yesso my fianc and i decided to stop at golden diner for breakfast today i pass it everyday on my way to work in jersey and saw that its been making some new renovations and its still under construction but it seemed presentable enough to provide a decent breakfast we park up with plenty of parking space and go to the entrance that seemed to be only temporary due to renovations we approached the cashier desk as we were waiting to be seated and it didnt take long for the host to recognize some new customers and seat us the host was very friendly and amiable she sat us and took our drink orders we ordered just water to start that was our mistake we didnt realize they serve tap water not filtered tap water but straight tap water i dont want to seem crazy for making this a bigger deal than it is but i dont drink tap water anywhere just because of water contamination and how bad its become all over the country so bottle water or filtered water is all we and our families drink that would have to be the only downfall about this place that and maybe just making their waitresses seem more welcoming to guests and not just a potential tip the food was great though i ordered the 1 breakfast special and it filled me up perfectly decent price and good food just dont order the water until they start serving filtered water or youre  comfortable with exposing yourself to potentially dangerous bacteriacute little cafe food is average healthy id like to see more rawvegan meals on the menu preferably salads and such no kale the juices are a bit too sweet and sadly they dont juice the greens they blend them into the juice so theyre not pure juices but rather half pure half blended they do have some good products on the shelves but again lets bring some good rawvegan treats in   im not a fan of processed healthy foods such as tofutempeh so i cant rave that those excite me add saladsthis place certainly knows its clientele  the upscale minimalist amosthipster vibe perfectly suits the penn community  unfortunately i think these attempts seem a little franchised and can only charge so much per meal because of the proximity to the penn undergrad living highrises  i recently gave this place a second chance and tried the udon noodle salad apparently their most popular salad  meh  though i love their philosophy commitment to composting and the purely vegetarian menu the portions are too small and expensive  the salad was good but not thrilling or filling  though the portion sizes really require a side side salads or fries cost 4450 half the cost of most meals  also when you get water with your meal you have to pour it from a prefilled pitcher without ice  hmmmmm  good try hipcityveg  just keep tryini like this place the last two times i have been in philadelphia i have dined at this facility here are the things i disliked  lighting in this place is very subpar you need to bring a flash light just to see the menu  the booth seating is okay felt very cramped especially with 4 people in a booth  because space is limited on this cramped booth adding large plates and dishes does not help the cause there is a hidden guarantee before you enter the premises that you will either wear what you are eating or at least manage to spill your food  these are the foods i would not order again  paneer pakoras really dry and felt they were heated in the microwave they had no flavor on their own needed to dunk them in a sauce just to eat more than one piece  stay away from the ghajer ka halwa carrot dessert sorry i cant explain it any better i must have had the leftovers from the weekend because it actually tasted like the carrots were starting to rot and they still decided to use them just plain awful  i would order these dishes again  malai kofta very delicious dish however they are a little stingy on kofta ball to sauce ratio  chicken biryani  ras malai probably the best i had in any indian restaurant  the waiter is friendly since there is only one guy working every time i have been thereendless chips were delicious especially when paired with dips my server was a nice guy considering it was a busy friday night restrooms were dirty and the back of my seat booth was wobbly so anytime i leaned back i disturbed my neighbor and vice versa went for happy hour great deal and ordered many apps and house margaritas everything was yummy but felt sick afterwards i would go back if i ran out of alternativesonce a staple for me is now fading sadly  i can not deny the brew still as tasty as it has always been in my opinion but the sad thing is the food quality is a ghost of its former self i understand corners need to be cut when a place just isnt generating the revenue it once did and lets be honest to be a owner of a pub in broad ripple cant be easy especially nowadays hell theres a new barrestaurant opening up every month it seems like but sometimes when this happens places like the brewpub lose it just saddens me to see what the food has become in the last 5 years  ex 1 prefab scotch eggs frozen the fried         2 beer cheese crock that is thinner than the beer you drink along side it  i actually let it set for a half hour to see if it would solidify but nope still like liquidsomething tells me i shouldnt be eating a cheese like that         3 fish and chips nothing to say here except if you remember what they were like 5 plus years ago youre sadly disappointed all dough and no show       i could go on but ill stop there  the upside is that its the brewpub and you should just check it out seriously especially if youre a pub lover this pub looks like you just walked into the uk very very much the real deal in terms of decor etc  also i just point out that they really do have some kick as weekly specialsi like the cinnamon sugar and plain cream cheese service was okay but a little slowcool russian inspired food and unique beers brewed in house just found out they offer brewery tours now which ill be looking into  staff is chill and an interesting group of downtoearth guys who started this establishment from ground up living a few doors down i know ill be back soon and recommend giving something new and different to try even if youre not local especially considering the places trendy relaxed one of a kind atmosphere and the areas abundance of optionsthis place is located at a strip mall with parking which is a plus its a convenience store in the front and a deli with seating inside and out in the back i came in with my mother and ordered a bacon egg and cheese hot ham and cheese sandwich and a butter roll the lady older is very nice and tried to help us the best she could but she really didnt understand the pos and it took her a while to put the order up for the kitchen once the order was up i reminded the lady at the register that i wanted salt pepper and ketchup on the bacon egg and cheese only way to eat it right btw and she went to tell one of the cooks who was apparently new she told the lady that it wasnt possible even though the sandwich wasnt even assembled the guy who seemed to be one of the owners or close to took over the orders the food was pretty good no complaints there but way overpriced im from new york and and work at a deli and i guess im used to really fast service but to make 3 sandwiches as simple as they were should have taken as long as they did and cost more than it does in new york which if you dont know has really high priced food if you are in a hurry i highly recommend calling ahead if not this isnt the place for you to go otherwise no complaints they should really try to write down order for the kitchen for more efficient service and as the order is being carried out ring the person up if not simplify the pos for the poor ladyi got to try a new donut well a donut that was new to me it was a yeast donut with a cream filling peanut butter glaze and chocolate sprinkles the cream tasted just like the pudding you can buy premade at the grocery  to me it has this underlying flavor of plastic so i wasnt crazy about thatbut the peanut butter glaze was the perfect flavor to help cover that uptypical 15 burger joint went on a sunday afternoon they were pretty busy but luckily we were able to be seated immediately odd half booth  half table seating with semiuncomfortable wood seats and backrests to match the wood tables they do have odd long pillows you can sort of use for added backrestcomfort lots of kidsfamilies our server was great and all the other servers who helped her out everyone was very pleasant i had the mushroom onion  swiss burger with sweet potato fries and a side of regular fries the burger was decentit could have been cooked less and it would have been much better sweet potato fries were good i just wish they didnt presalt them  a little salty for me the regular fries were also just ok honestly they didnt taste super fresh i cant say i would never go back here and try something new but just keep in mind you can get similar burgers at half the price at competing restaurants  the ambiance was 5050 the overall decor was nice loud but it was fullpacked with customers the seatingcushions were filthy with food remnants  if i do go back id like to try something new and request the burger to be cooked at a different tempi ate at bareburger for my first time last week the burger was good but i did have an issue with the prices i had the standard burger and after asking the waitress if the french fries were really worth getting and being assured they were great i ordered a side of ff  that was a mistake  they were old limp and cost 285 for a handful  i love ff and i didnt even eat half of them even at that price  i dont mind 6 oz burgers not everyone wants a halfpound of meat  but the prices especially for just the standard beef burger were ridiculous given that they are regularsized burgers the meat burger combinations run anywhere from 10  13 and thats with no real side  everything even an additional different sauces is a la carte so youre best off not trying to put your own combination together i didnt bother ordering anything to drink because i knew just the basic burger and the side of limp fries were already going to be running me at least 18 with tax and tip so i too got the small glass of lukewarm water like another reviewer mentioned i couldnt help but sit there and think fondly of bobbis burgers in university city i realize that theyre not stocking all the unusual meats but if youre looking for a beef or chicken or turkey burger the prices and certainly the french fries are are definitely better and the combos are somehow easier to follow inspired and tempting a carousel of 4 different sauces sit on the counters and tables to be used on burgers or fries as you wish  and for free maybe thats why i felt especially annoyed at bareburger i felt the concept was good the ingredients were good but i was being nickled and dimed to death and the execution wasnt great too bad that bareburger is only 4 blocks from where i live i really wanted to like it moredont get your hopes up on a slice of specialty pizza even though its on their menu they cant make it and will offer you to purchase all the toppings on a cheese slice of pizza   so we ordered a cheese slice and its been 20 mins and it has not come out yet  and still waiting   waitress is not attentive to the table and cares more about gossiping with co workers and twirling her hair overheard her complaining about a tip she received from a customer   as we finally received our food i have changed my 2 start review to a 3 star based on the food quality  food over all is pretty tasty i wouldnt recommend the cheese slice but the stromboli was deliciousdont know if there has been a change over in staff recently but service has gotten much better on my more recent trips that said ive been too fearful to go during their normal lunch hours but around 10am and 2pm the service is much bettermy favorite taco bell food quality is ok amount of meat in the tacos is light fast service the counter clerk asked for a charitable donation i dont really mind this too much but dont act like im not charitable when i say no i give lots to charities of my choosing i dont know what tbs is but i vet all charities before i give my money away smiles would help a lot too friendly service gets customers back understand you dont make much but i didnt either when i was young but i smiled and chatted with the customersi ate at tired hands fermentaria for the 3rd time so i feel like i can finally review the restaurant let me say that if this was a brewery review it would be a 5  if you are looking to have some good beers and a snack this is the spot for a full blown dining experience you can do better  my waiter steven according to receipt said about 5 words to me the whole time i was there  none of those words were your welcome or thank you  he could have been having an off night so i wont harp on it but as someone who travels 100 nightsyear for work and eats out all of those nights i feel i know horrendous service when i see it  the beer here is phenomenal  the hummus and tacos were pretty darn good as well  i think next time im in town ill try harder to sit at the bar and just have beers and appspark on the pier for free if you can find parking if not just do valet and tip the guy the wait here on a saturday late afternoon wasnt too bad for 2 we just want something to snack on before dinner we got the crab for 22 was disappointed because they crab was so small the slaw that was given tasted so bland and even have crab shells in there probably from the guy chopping up the crab in the back we tried the clam chowder and it wasnt anything spectacular will not be coming backcousins isnt the greatest supermarket if you want the freshest produce but the quality of meats and seafood arent that bad the prices are pretty cheap they constantly have sales also if you want spanish products this is the place to shop they have a very large selection of spanish products once again not the greatest market but its still goodmaynards has a great look and it is right next to the train station there is a deli side and a restaurant side service was attentive  wine list well appointed  we wanted to like it better here is the downsidethe particular meal we had was only ok    we did start with the frites french fries which were tasty and yeah truly low brow  buy hey we were in the mood    the pork schnitzel was only ok some of the parts were cool  flavors did not pop my halibut was on a bed of white beans and then something sweet roasted grapes for one thing which just made for a fussy dish  i love halibut but not sweet  and the beans tended to wash flavors out not a fan of that dish     we may have ordered badly    small nit on service they took our orders wrong but that was quickly taken care of  weird to see what came initially   waiter apologetic and offered more glasses of wine but we had to pass as we were driving tuscon has a lot of great places to eat and perhaps this was an off night  but for us it didnt work and it was pretty expensive  wont be backbaileys reminded me of hop doddy because of their focus on burgers ice cream and shakes baileyss had quite a selection of burgers with different toppings from your classic burger to fried mac and cheese and pbj a lot of them sounded really great and i wanted to try multiple   my brother and i got the davies chop house and wicked apple we also ordered small fries with chipotle ketchup and fried pickles the burgers were good but quite small for what you pay  the fries and fried pickles were just okay i didnt really like the batter on the picklesfood was pretty good  i had the eggplant lasagna and curry veggies  i thought it might have been a little pricey considering its not made to order and more like cafeteria style served  i paid almost 9 for the two  parking kinda bad but i will be going backi dont see what the big deal is it was good but not enough to come back my ribs were fatty and served over generic tasteless bread my husbands chicken was juicy and tender its right off the pinellas trail so it might be nice to stop off for a quick bite on a walk or bike ride but i wouldnt make it a point to come backyeah i shouldnt eat pizza twice a day well it was late i was hungry and it was the closest thing open  the people were nice im not sure whether it was the sauce or the cheese but something was spicy it was spicy in a good way besides that standard crust standard cheese you know a pizzadecent food  i got the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend got the grilled cheese grilled cheese was well cheesy a variety of cheeses blended very well together and pair nicely with a beer the pulled pork sandwich was smoky for sure whatever sauce came with it was killer i substituted brussel sprouts for the potato salad both the sprouts and sandwich had a smokyburnt aftertaste that reminded me of a griddle that carried the flavors of all the other foods from the day not something im used to  the beers are respectable the menu offers a chance to find your match based on a chart on the back sweet vs bitter light vs dark it helped me settle on the oatmeal stout  ive definitely had better but this was drinkable the summer ale must be pretty popular they were out when my girlfriend requested it our waitress recommended the klsch instead nice and crisp perfect for summer  a rather lively patio with musical stylings this marylander is unaccustomed to but could definitely get into waitstaff is friendly and prices are fine though they seem to take a jump up on entrees if youre nearby this place is good  ps dont forget to drop into the store to bring some of the beers homeupating with the name change to sweet taco not feeling real good about this change menu is now limited and so far unchanging  one of the things we liked was seeing different things pop up quality of has slipped a bit too  had a favorite brisket taco and it was real dry sauces and spices are not as tasty either were going to hang in there for now pulling for chris and charlie we want you guys to do wellbe prepared for a long wait for your food coffee was good but the same breakfast food quality can be found at ihop if you have a lot of time this is the place if you need quick breakfast food you better go somewhere elseedit spoke with the manager and it seems like i definitely had a one off experience might be a new crew or something going on and they were short handed going to be giving it another try because i feel the manager truly meant what he said    this is one of the worst experiences ive had i placed an online order this morning to pick up my pizza at 115 pm so i could get in and get out for my lunch  i get there and theres nothing marking the pick up area except a little text on some glass near the oven i tell them im here for my order and they tell me it was lost in the system and they ask me what the pizza was i tell them and they start to make it then tell me i can grab a drink i tell the lady behind the counter i got a mexican fanta but there are none she tells me to take a coke instead and shrugs when i ask about fanta fantastic   so then i get my pizza and its cooked right and my pizza except i got the half pizza that includes a saladand theres no salad couldnt afford to waste any more time pizza took 10 minutes to get out  so i got charged 11 for half a personal pizza no salad and a coke theres also nowhere on my online order to request help or a refund  i wont be backpretty good place went friday night not overly busy but steady had some dim sum items all good price was ok for the two of us will definitely returnthe food was fairly average the waitstaff was inattentive but quick the sundae waffle was far from what was implied in the name and was prepared differently than the menu suggested and did not have enough fruit the cinnamon bun pancake at first bite was delicious but the more you eat it the more you realize it is subpar the filling was far too sticky and the pancake far too dense it was also overpriced for the quality of the food roughly 30 dollars for both of us 6510 experience overallthis place is so close to home i think ill try walking there next time  theres nothing wrong with 3 stars  its pretty darn good  my favourite thing here is the dipping sauce for the curly fries  the fries themselves are darn good too    i love the toasted buns for the burger and the ingredients always seem fresh  ive read reviews complaining about the size of the patty but i honestly havent noticed a problem  i always leave full and with a smile on my facemy onceamonth place while waiting for my wifes meeting to end always busy a bit noisy but if i xan sit in the comfy chair im happy friendly baristasvery fresh food and affordable the workers constantly replaced food before it was completely out which was great they dont have a big variety of food as i expected from a chineseamerican buffet if youre okay with having affordable food something that tastes great with only the basic choices and nothing fancy this would be your placei usually go to pick up a gyro ive only eaten at a table in the restaurant twice  the reason i pick up a gyro rather than eat in is because the service is ridiculously sllooowwww  i would eat in when i have a couple of hours to sit around  maybe its greek tradition to sit around a few hours for a meal  the food is pretty good there arent many greek restaurants in gloucester or camden countries and i would give four stars but i subtract a star for slow service  even picking up i place my order and come back 30 minutes later  they need 30 minutes to put together a lamb gyrothe food is pretty expensive and the bagels are average  my everything lacked that aromatic crispy shell but it was soft and flavorful with plenty of cream cheese  and i do love the fact that they are open early and serve la colombe coffee  a decent bagel place but not an outstanding oneone of the coolest looking bars youll find in any town ive been here about 67 times and the staff is usually great i asked a bartender to recreate a drink they had on an old menu one time and he said that he couldnt eaten here twice and was not impressed either time my social group wont eat here any more because of the food quality but i will still come by here occasionally for a drink because the bar has such a cool sceneportions were quite small and the taste wasnt really there i would recommend trying another chipotleit gets more stars for the beer menu my wife and i both got burgers they were clearly frozen you could taste the freezer burn the fries were good though   i really enjoy the beer selection and will go back because of that but i would probably not eat there againthe gelato is good for the area best there is actually  if you have authentic tastebuds they will be looking for a more italian or new york flavor the product is expensive  do not buy a coke here 199 plus tax you have got to be kidding that is 1200 a six pack  coffee is good with all the delineation you expect again pricy for our little towncheddars is everywhere but i had never been in one before this last trip to belleville  i have to say it is a step up from crapplebees but still solidly chainfamily food  i went with a strawberry lemonade chicken tortilla soup and had the pepper whitefish with ginger rice  the rice was a little gross huge chunks of ginger in it that were not exactly tasty but the fish was fine and the server was very good as well  four people ate here for about 60 which is what you expect of a family restaurant chainmy first visit to this brewery restaurant and im close to being a fan we were here to celebrate a friends birthday and it seemed like all 12 or so of us were satisfied with our food and experience   it is a large and open space both dining room and bar area with some outside seating available as well if i were to revisit a good chance i will id probably opt for bar area especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch the day of the event our 530 was changed to 500 by the restaurant this was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7 we were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party   i first perused the beer offerings there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans i selected their blueberry hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night even though little to no berry taste came through i would probably try something else next time the food menu was possibly too large in my opinion with sandwich pizza apps and entrees offered i was very hungry and 75 of the menu appealed to me so i went to our excellent server frank for his advice he suggested a few dishes and i thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree it proved to be good advice a nicely cooked frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes the fowl was tender and juicy still the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened the mashed were ok and probably the weakest link in the dish i had an add on caesar salad that was fair and overpriced as add ons go at 6 trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special she loved it and i have to admit they are sourcing quality crustaceans  most others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things surprisingly no one else tried any beer we brought our own bday cake and were not charged a plating fee beer aficionados should consider joining their reward program for a 15 one time fee you are entitled to a special glass that holds 22 oz for the price of a pint along with other perks and incentives great place for gatherings lets go with 375 ongoing research yelpspros the long line moved very quickly  my husband liked his sweet potato pancakes  my bacon although expensive was tasty  cons the service wasnt very friendly and she did everything she could to move us in and out we hadnt even received a menu before she asked what we wanted i know theres a line but still it wasnt welcoming  the buttermilk pancakes were just ok after two i just lost my interest in eating them and it wasnt because i was full they were underwhelming i know buttermilk pancakes arent exactly exiting to begin with but still good ones can usually captivate my attention long enough to to be eaten entirelygoing to frost in tucson only makes me long for the good ol days of gelato classico in the foothills mall i think i was only eight or nine when that beauty went belly up and nearly twenty years later good god im still not over it where were all you gelato lovers back in the day that place was by far superior  fortunately since moving out to san francisco ive discovered that the gelato classico brand is alive and well out here all those years in mourning i never knew if youre ever up in the bay drop by north beach and have you some til then i digress  frost is about the only gelato option in tucson its alright if you need a fix but is ultramodern in flavor and flair on the cusp of oro valley and the foothills and overflowing with yuppies and yuppie high schoolers any given summer night of the week whereas gelato classico was a burst of creamy oldworld flavor with a wafer cookie to be enjoyed while strolling the cobbled back roads of romeer the foothills mall frost is an uppity winter wonderland where the gelatos not as flavorful or creamy but comes with a gigantic selection and minimalist fridgelike decor  whats the moral of my longwinded story i guess you should ask yourself if you prefer form over function i love gelato but it seems tucson tried it before and it just didnt work out you guys can try and cram into frost and wait in the long line while hawaiian shirtloafer sandals guy samples ten flavors in the southwest im happier spending summer nights grubbing on 150 raspados con frutas chilling on the trunk of my cari had high hopes for this place but coming from a southern family ive been spoiled the chicken tenders were dry the mac  cheese was good the herb beef was excellent the cauliflower side was good the green bean casserole was ok and the cornbread was just ok positive extremely fast servicethe food here is always excellent and the drinks are fantastic however i have been here on several occasions and the service has been questionable all times be prepared for slowerslightly strange service but a great mealthis place is superretro and a fun place to visit i would definitely go back even though the food i had was just average i tried a focaccia with grilled onions spinach and mozzarella it was bland and dull   the place would be perfect for a date night as they specialize in martinis flavored sodas and dessertsgreat pier parking accesible during a monday night it was free after 730pm the food was fair lobster tacos and onion rings a bit under seasoned okay portions clam chowder yummy and chunky prices fair for a restaurant on the waves 13 crab sandwich with sides 15 seafood pastas 19 lobster tacos friendly service a nice experiencemediocre at best service is soso pho should be hard to mess up but for the price the meat was scant and the soup was not well seasoned im used to getting spring rolls with delicious sauce that accompanies it but there wasnt that here may have been off day i give every place 3 triesits hard to review whole foods because you kinda know what youre getting into but every time feels different  as with all other whole foods you can find   great quality foods   ridiculous prices   insanely helpful staff   rich people  health nuts  hipsters  so here are the things that stand out more about this particular whole foods    the parking situation is insane  ive always found a spot but its just a madhouse trying to get in here  since theres high traffic in and out something should open up but that doesnt mean youre gonna like the experience    its very busy and a bit cramped compared to some of the other whole foods ive been to    they dont have prosciutto di parma which is the most first world problem one can havei really wanted to like this place but when you hand my a soy cappucino litterally all foam when i order a latte we have a seriously problem here did i mention the fact that the espresso was literally on fire hot oh i didnt well it was and that made me quite sad i have always been curious about the good karma up on 22nd passing it constantly when driving over to see the west philly folks ive never had reason to stop because i was always headed somewhere however when this one opening up so close to my house it was clear i could take it in for consideration   i stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf they let me bring the dog in massive props the space is really lovely its got great high ceilings lots of sitting room but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria no cushy seating they are open late which is nice but still its just not quite what im looking for if i leave my house and walk south instead of north i end up at chapterhouse and while gk is certainly nice i also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place and at least at my first visit it was not it burnt my mouth and was 34 foam and 14 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word   im sure well try it again and at that point ill give it a second chance and second review but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix sorry guysi sat at the bar and the bar tender was amazing  warm friendly helpful he recommended a great beer black abbey rose i had a classic cheeseburger and it was nothing special  just a normal cheeseburger the truffle fries on the other hand were amazing there are better burger places i wont be backphat bites is okay 2 phat the smaller counterpart is actually way better the fruit tea was very watered down the portions of the chicken salad in the ninja star werent as generous at this location and the staff was less enthused about my business ill keep going to 2 phat instead for the same foodi actually met the owner brian flowers before he opened tabletop caf as he was advertising himself at a pogob boardgame meetup event im pleased to find that the ttc is wellspaced adequately lit if a bit overly warm and lacking temperature control if youre a thin guy like me that spews btus youll die in the summer months spacious hardwood tables greet you as you walk in with reservations available you sign up at the counter and are free to float between tables with your entry fee and all consumables paid for at the end of your visit  the most attractive feature of ttc is the large boardgame collection as well as the flat 5day for allday gaming 250hr at rival hexagon caf on whyte the customer service is efficient and polite but not necessarily friendly orders may not be taken from tables generally you must make your way up to the counter and interrupt play or hope there isnt a queue after taking your turn in your game   long hours up to 1am on friday and saturday night are quite a delight as you may choose whenever is convenient for you to go solo or with a group of friends despite my belief that this out of the way location would be an issue for most gamers as many are not vehicle owners i was pleasantly surprised that the location is only a 5 minute walk from a 8 stop   as with most boardgame cafs ttc suffers from more emphasis on the boardgame and not enough on the caf overpriced and undersized portions for all food as well as lacking diversity though i found it of good quality and quite edible of course outside drinks and food are not permitted just like movie concession this is where they make their money   all in all a fun hangout place at great prices just eat before you go or head out for a meal and come back to more gaming afterwardswent on a tuesday  7pm  the inside is decorated very nicely  i had one of the sandwiches as did my dinner partner  the food was just okay nothing special  however the deserts are to die for  will definitely be back for the desert  two people fooddrinksdessert came to around 50food was 3 stars and service and surroundings a 4 so more a 35 rating while hanging downtown with the family  w 2 kids under 3 we needed a place to sit at a booth and have great food i had heard about this place from more than a few people   salads were pretty good and the wings as well  they did however overcook my burger and it had no taste when you are dining with kids and you only have a brief window to eat  its hard to send back an overcooked burger  especially when you are hungry staff was great with my kids and their food came out very quickly i would go back to try other items and maybe leave the kids with a sitterthis place is really nice and they have two small tables outside which is nice we ordered a latte and lox bagel sandwich latte was really good but lox sandwich had two small pieces of smoked salmon and invaded by tomatoes which is not the way it should be thats why 3 starssecond to sally oneils pizza hotline i have been eating at cappys since it was on howard the service has never been much to speak of but the pizza is good salads are nice toochicken fingers were good the sauce was great had the right mixture of spiceyness and flavor didnt see anything else but chicken fingers on menucoffee drinks are great i hear they have a hot chocolate bar on saturdays right now that i have to check out too that being said stick to the drinks i ordered a breakfast sandwich and the egg on it was a hardboiled egg heated up with cheese on it im gagging thinking about it it was awful ill be back for coffee but thats about itcoffee was delicious being from out of town and my first visit i had no idea that this was more self servicethis place is deathly depressing the whole was going to be  a dance club look and the upper level balcony area thats never seen a customer because there havent been more than halfadozen in the place at once just leave a funny feeling  but once youre past the ridiculousness of the place its a decent value  i as most do im sure stumbled upon it for speedy sustenance before a flick next door  i had zero expectations  but i admit i was pleasantly surprised by the food it was nothing extraordinary but it was pleasing and the price was good  ive even made repeat trips  considering ive made missteps in my preritz dining in the neighborhood several times its a safety spotmy boyfriend and i went here for restaurant week why i dont know because we certain could afford it on a regular day but we were craving seafood  i expected a whole different type of place  i thought that the restaurant would have more of a romantic feeling sadly it was lacking  the decor was outdated but gave it character  i started off with the crab soup and it was eh   i had better i actually think trader joes crab corn soup had more flavor  if you are looking for great seafood soup go to philips seafood  now that is what i call a delicious soup    i opted for crab cakes for my entree and they were just ok  i personally felt like there was too much filler in them    although the waitress was sweet she was soooo slow  be prepared to wait for a while    overall if youre looking for a seafood restaurant with character this is the place but if your standards and hopes are set high but prepared to lower thempretty expensive compared to other pho restaurants the banh mi and pho are both smaller but more expensive got the chicken pad thai once and it was the blandest thing ive ever tasted before do not get it its in iv though so im not complaining much the food is decent the service is not that great would go again but only because theres no other vietnamese place nearbyive been here a few times food and beer are average nothing too special very disappointed that they will not fill a growler with a different brewery name on it i have never been to another brewery that does that definitely will not go here againfive guys is usually a favorite of mine and my husband weve never been to the one in trinity and i doubt we will go back first my husband ordered his burger all the way and added raw onions he got mayo ketchup mushrooms and raw onions and thats it no lettuce no tomato no grilled onions no mustard also we ordered a large order of fries usually a large order fills the cup and overflows into the bag which is more than enough for both of us instead the cup was half empty and the rest of the cup dumped into the bag very disappointing mealfood and service average beautiful decor but thats it what a disappointment after all the hype 10 servers standing around and we couldnt get one to stop by then food totally underwhelmingnice atmosphere  sat at the bar for apps and a glass of wine  we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful bartender but soon after we were seated a young woman took over that seemed less than happy to help us  we ordered an antipasto platter which was fine nothing too exciting i think fine sums it upfriday i had a chance to go to the pub  kitchen for the first time with friends as far as a bar astmosphere it was great good bartenders and they had my favorite whiskey which most bars do not carry a big plus we waited about an hour an half for a table as expected it was a friday night so we drank more  once we seated in the back room area we were greeted by a great waitress who was pleasant and great personallity the food was subpar to say the least small portions and extremely expensive based on we ordered the cheese plate i would have to say was a joke 2 pieces of cheese the size of a stamp and 2 pieces of bread my girlfriend had the mussels which she said were very bland i had a burger which was actually really good my friends had a burger and a salad   as bar to drink and hangout i give it 5 stars i will return to pub and kitchen for drinkswe chose the ritz carlton for our most recent staycation over memorial day weekend due to the high volume of guests at the resort they opened caytons up for dinner on a sunday night we had a pretty large group so we played it safe and went with the restaurant that could accommodate us all and they certainly did upon arrival we were directed to a private dining room from a service stand point id say it was a fivestar experience the staff was super friendly and extremely patient with our rowdy group the food on the other hand was aok caytons menu lists over ten different gourmet burgers salads sandwiches and even adult shakes including one called the dude that alone might we be worth an additional star   menu items come with catchy names like home on the range a buffalo burger the belushi and the no substitutions  a quarter pound burger with three cheeses pancetta bacon and a bunch more burgers are no more expensive than zin burger i ordered the home on the range buffalo burger which was served with oaxaca cheese guacamole and cilantro mayo with a side of tater tots i shouldve gone with the belushi the patty was bright red and definitely appeared undercooked for my taste but considering it was a buffalo patty which tends to be leaner im guessing that was the intention of the kitchen several others in our group ordered the jabroni which was loaded with two patties pancetta capicola mozzarella and a few other items i cant recall it was definitely a heavy choice  the hit of the night was definitely the dude shake   since we were there at night we didnt get to catch the views of the golf course the restaurant itself is certainly upscale since i dont golf i dont imagine myself returning here for a meal anytime soon it appeared as though the bathrooms also served as locker rooms for women which were not very clean perhaps this was an oversight given that they opened up on an offnight   over all caytons was a fun choice for our group we were especially thankful for the shuttle to and and from the resort otherwise we might have ended up on the 10th greenalonein the darkif you want a basic breakfast with no frills this is the place for you they sell all day breakfast our grits and eggs were very bland no seasoning or salt at all the strawberry french toast i ordered was topped with the corn syrup filled canned strawberries i expected fresh or something close  the service was good the staff was friendlythe ccc was outside my work today so i decided to play errand boy for the beautiful wife and grab lunch  i checked their menu online consulted with the wife on what she wanted and headed out to the truck  i also just on a whim checked their twitter and saw they took creditdebit cards with square  there was a line of four people in front of me and maybe 35 people waiting for their food  the orders went quickly then much to my disappointment i first saw a sign saying they only take credit cards for orders of 15 or more and the menu had changed the wife wanted their quarter chicken platter which is no more  i went with a cuban and a three taco platter pork short rib and chicken  originally i had wanted the curried sweet potato but they were out of that which basically meant vegetarians were screwed  maybe they have a salad but really who wants to always eat salad  both platters i believe mentioned having beans which i was hoping for the corn and the cuban also mentioned an orange  and despite my bill coming out to only 1450 they still allowed me to use my credit card  whew  the food took about 10 minutes and they have foil to put on top thank goodness the winds are gusting today  i ventured home with food in hand  upon the unfoiling we discovered their fiesta corn and no beans never mind the brown mexican rice which is on their online menu  the cuban was ok the saucemustard was too sweet  the tacos were ok but everything just tasted sweet to me even though officially only the short rib has the cha cha sauce  obviously i had not read jen hs review and thought these were going to be closer to traditional limecilantro  i will add that the fellow who took my order was nice though a bit rushed  which was understandable due to the line  if i ran into them at 200 am theyd be five stars  but alas im sober so ill generously give them three stars really more 2 12 but ill kick them up for investing the time and effort in having a food truck that visits downtownbeautiful coffee shop i used to love this place and would go there every time i was in town but ever since they started roasting their own beans things went down hill its either the roast of their castle brand or their bean to water ratio 2nd time here before i wrote the review and you really cant charge 4 for a cup and have coffee that is flavorless you shouldnt try to save  on not using the correct amount of beans coffee tastes like watered down tea drink the verve espresso or try the pour over great pastries they did try to give me a free drink so im sure ill be backi went there for lunch and it wasnt bad at all i had the veggie burger combo with fries and a drink and it was about ten dollars which isnt all that pricy the fries were cooked just right and salted nicely the veggie burger was very good but ive had better at other places near by surprisingly for lunchtime it was almost empty inside which i dont mind by the way tables are a little small if you go with a group of people seats arent all that comfortable but i dont mind if its a quick meal i gave it 3 stars because i dont think its all that special and i feel like you can get the same quality food if not better elsewhere for a cheaper priceoverpriced for what you get the appetizers were good might go back for apps and drinks not for dinneri used to love this place for their chocolate milkshakes but recently theyve made it super milky and very thin which i dont appreciate at all the food is good and flavourful but quantities are on the lower side for the price you paygreat place for your organic food needs but the pricing is bit high end  food for breakfast and lunch are great and can grab and go better than some other deli or sandwich place great taste and recommended  vegetables are fresh and i suggest to look out of the use before date before you buy i have seen few products that are very close to use before date and the they are big that you cant finish it before that dayjust want to start by saying ive been waiting for this place to open forever ive driven past it a million times even before this place came along when it was bastas we went as a family this past tuesday night the place looked amazing i absolutely loved the decorpaintings inside and out with that being saidthats where my raving review stops upon entering i expected a hey welcome to our new fabulous restaurant from the hostess and instead got a party of four from one of the three random girls hanging around the door and fumbling with menus i followed one into the room past the bar and upon entering she kind of stood to the side i made that face i guess because she said oh sit wherever youd like she was very quiet and didnt seem hostess material our server came along and she seemed nice i ordered the house margarita which was good and my husband got a corona the menu was small which was fine as long as all 5 dinner entrees are exceptional but we didnt see any kid menus i asked and she said they didnt have any not sure if just today or ever they could do chicken fingers chicken taco or cheese quesadilla chips and salsa was good salsa was too spicy for the girls and we ordered the queso that was a huge disappointment literally heated up shredded cheese that when cooled was like lumps of melted shredded cheese haha my husband ordered the shredded pork tacos i chucked the receipt so i dont remember the entrees correct name and i had the steak entree my oldest daughter wanted a ground beef and cheese only soft taco server said ok great our younger daughter had the cheese quesadilla server comes back out a bit later and says they dont have ground beef i wasnt sure if that was ever or not that day our server wasnt seemingly knowledgable about the menu or what was in house currently if we asked about something i dont blame her basically she wasnt trained very well food took some time and when it came out it wasnt the wow i was hoping for either my husbands was good mine was okay the quesadilla was fine and oh yeah kids meals come with rice the kids chicken taco wasnt good she didnt eat it we opted out of dessert overall we werent impressed  saw the owner type guys talking to their friends but they never went to any tables in our area to ask about the foodservice or say hello big negative there ive been a serverbartender for about 17 yrs other reviewers can say what they want about working out kinks and how they just opened in my opinion they are losing return customers that live locally because of this mentality this should have been an amazing dinner to match the decor  i expected moreawesomeness one thing i have to mention is that right after we got there little one had to use the restroom and it was out of toilet paper i mentioned it to our server upon returning to the table so that she could tell the hostess an hour later my other daughter goes in and our server is in there filling up the toilet paper holders in every place i have worked this is a hostess responsibility not the person delivering your fooddrinks that was not a good move it wasnt even busy so i dont know why the server would do it anywaysorry about the long rant i soo wanted this to be our new place kinda sucks convenience store with a vietnamese restaurant inside that also does traditional nola po boys along with banh mi and nolas own yaka mein aka old sober  the chicken pho is a flavorful version in a a good size bowl that is not too small or too large  there is a dining area in the front with tables and chairs and then a lot of folks get things to go here   prices are quite affordable for many things and a good value for what you get for some items and less so for othersthis is more like 35stars ice cream is fabulous fabulous fabulous the waitress recommended bearcat and yes she was so right all of my 3 stars are dedicated to their ultimate ice cream  negative 2 stars are their soup my bf had peanut soup it was um weird i had gumbo too salty and too much seasoning and we both had dill pickles soup pickles in soup not necessary any of their famous soups were not so good  oh but the mozzarella cheese  pesto sauce garlic bread was yummy recommended  well definately stop by again for great ice cream but not for lunchi stopped at taqueria del sol to grab a quick dinner for my wife and i the tacos are on the smaller side but are pretty inexpensive so its not an issue it actually worked out fairly well because i grabbed 4 different tacos to try    carnita  slow cooked pork and is a pretty common option in mexican restaurants the carnita was decent certainly not the best ive ever had nor the worst id get it again 3 stars   fish  standard fish taco it wasnt bad but i probably wont get it again 2 stars   fried chicken  fried chicken strips with a jalapeno mayo i thought it was ok but it was definitely my wifes favorite no doubt well be getting this one every time 3 stars   veggie  the veggie taco is loaded with refried beans it was on the spicy side too spicy for my wifes tastes but perfect for mine shockingly it was definitely my favorite 4 stars   in conclusion id definitely go back to taqueria del sol for a quick taco dinner its way better than taco bell they also have a full bar if thats what youre looking forto be fair the place is an extraordinary visual dream  the counterperson was very accommodating when asked if i would like to order breakfast at 5 to 11  i did and he asked the chefs not to put the breakfast acudaments away  very kind and great service   i was terribly excited to meet my husband for brunch during the work week but was slightly disappointed with my order  being vegetarian i thought i might try the biscuit egg dish without the egg and enjoy the tomato jam  it was over cooked could hardly bite into the biscuit and the jam far too sweet    oh well perhaps i will just have coffee next time because that was deliciousi normally enjoy my meals at chipotle ive eaten at several and the food is pretty well standardized  however today in marlton i had the worst chips from them this was the first time ive ever received a bag that was over salted as if they were sprayed with salt water that was allowed to evaporate  i will warn everyone away from their expensive barely passable queso i decided to give it a second try since i did have some when it first came out and wasnt thrilled then  so on second try its the same  it tastes as if the sauce broke while heating it i read some info about it on the web and while chipotle needs to keep it all natural im sure they can go back to the drawing board and get rid of the grainy binders in their recipe pass on it youve been warnedsome great food finds  too fancy schmancy and pretentious and too big  still a better alternative to most toxic food stores in areadoesnt it seem like a lot of conversations these days start with  i just found this great insert stinky cheese here and whole foodstrader joes youve got to try some dont you just love whole foodstrader joes  i like whole foods but im not one of those bourgeoisie folks who defines themselves by shopping there if youre buying raspberries in november folks they didnt come from anywhere around philly some days though you just need a sushi snack after hitting the art museum as far as whole foods locations go this is one of the better ones because its really large and spacious unlike my tiny coop also the prepared items seem to be more extensive here i like that whole foods carries ceres juice something i fell in love with while living in south africa as much as i loathe the prices who else carries the flaxseed meal i need for my vegan cookies and the employees are pretty nice unless theyve got that obnoxious hipster vibe because their jeans are six sizes too small i also may have a slight crush on one of the cashier dudes but what else is new im not about to blow my paycheck shopping there regularlyhave heard great things but wasnt as good as anticipated  my burger was over cooked over handled in the making which made the burger chewier than should be  wide selection of sauces and burgers but frankly i think i prefer the flavor and texture of steak and shakemom and dad dragged us there surprisingly good food and beeri think some of the reviews are a bit of an exaggeration the sushi was very good dont get me wrong but most definitely not the best ive ever had  thus far it is the best sushi in the immediate area but there are places in philly that i much rather go haru morimoto shinju  i went for lunch and had one of the boxes  the fish was fresh but wasnt as rich as i like it the sides were not very good cold noodles potato salad reg salad  i will definitely go back but by no means my favoritegood location  not sure when it was updated with all the race car stuff but i didnt like it  my kiddo liked playing the games on the wall  its a decent mcds overallwings are incredible burgers are descent pizza is too greasy and cheesey chicken caesar wrap is good sometimesfood is not consistent ive heard comments about service issues however ive always had a good experience in that department  place has a lot of potential theres a huge super nice outside seating area with a bar  a bunch of tvs inside and a great craft beer selection give it a shotit wasnt very goodi went just for the wings and they were nothing to write home about i wont be going back for the wings but may try the pizza next timethis review is going to be all over the place but deserved for the length of time waiting in line for pancakes this place was recommended by pretty everyone we met before and after arriving in nashville so we gave it a whirl on a saturday morning the line was out the door and around the corner alllll the way down 21st avenue we heard the line went fast so we braved it we made friends in line  a large family from indiana and a family from new orleans we all concurred that we must be crazy for standing in a line this long for pancakes we heard there was actually a system for determining how long youd be waiting in line we were at the point on the street that was definitely going to be over an hour husband brought us coffee from across the street i had time to peruse a really cute gift shop a thousand faces where the line began and was able to purchase yet another dog print by marc tetro a few people gave up waiting which i had mixed feelings about because if they waited even 20 minutes that was too long to wait to then give up but on the flip side it meant yay we moved a little closer to the front of the line good riddance impatient ones  as we neared the entrance i began to feel quite faint and wondered if i was even going to make it in to try one of twenty three flavors of pancakes at the front of the line near the entrance there was a coffee station which we missed two hours later we were called to our seats the bus boy cleaned off our table and promised us the greatest breakfast of our lives i had the caribbean pancakes its hard to say if the meal was life changing because i felt physically ill by the time we sat down and ordered my pancakes were good the syrup was especially delicious were they life changing im afraid not my beloved tupelo honey still holds the best pancakes in the world award and i dont think anyone has ever had to wait two hours for them i cant recall what my husband ordered but he definitely had the cured ham which i tried and did not like at all we felt a little disappointed when we left but im not saying i wouldnt go back but i would not wait in line that long again i would not advise going when you are a little or a lot hungry   catching up on portlandia episodes the next night we felt the brunch village episode was especially hilarious and fitting given the time we spent in line the day prior while we didnt experience any tim robbins pirate types we did wonder why provence didnt have an ed begley jr out on 21st shouting to pancake pantry patrons to come to their restaurant with little to no waitthe service was terrific the food was good just not amazing we ordered french toast eggs hash browns and pancakes the hash browns were an extra 3 or 4 for just a small amountthis review is strictly for my market lunch experience  came here for lunch and ordered the chicken sandwich and my friend got the ceasar salad i also order their chai because im a chai fanatic and order it whenever i get the chance the food was okgood ingredients but for the price id expect something a little closer to ajs fine foods the concept is setup similar to ajs where they serve pastries cafe drinks sandwiches etc my chai while it was decent was only filled up maybe 13 of the way and the rest foam  i ordered a large btw and it felt very much like a small so for a 5 chai latte i definitely felt i got jipped we sat outside in the patio and the train kept going by every 1015mins it was very loud and awkward to have a conversation with my friend my sandwich was simply okay i only ate one half and didnt finish the other the service was really good the lady was very patient with me while i was ordering    overall im going to stick to ajscloser to home and much more satisfying i will have to come for dinner and hopefully the food will be bettermy daughter had the beef and cheddar brisket and i got the ny brisket the cheddar brisket taste just like a bbq sandwich nothing special about it and my ny brisket felt like ham w melted cheese sandwich i gotta say though the bread is really soft the services was good cant complain would i go there again meh i mean i would choose them over subway but if im on a budget subway lolstopped by here on our way to the airport after reading yelp reviews park in the back walk in and go to the back of the store to order your food  we went with two orders of beef pho regular 12 inch bahn mi spring roll and vietnamese ice tea    beef pho  you can definitely taste the msg in the broth can be overwhelming so if you are not a fan of msg i would recommend you stay away from the dish  spring roll  its not made fresh as it tasted like it was made the day before and left overnight and i can see this happening as they open early and closes at 8pm   bahn mi  the best food amongst the food we ordered  i dont know if pickled radish is standard in bahn mi but this place did not use radish in their bahn mi  there is a seating area by the from of the store once you are done eating go to the cashier and pay for your meali was skeptical when someone at the dog park told me that italianos was better than pops  i am new to philly and to water ice  but after trying pops i saw no reason to go anywhere else  then i had a moment of insanity and thought why not try to broaden my horizons  i had italianos vanilla water ice  it was fine  aok  but a bit too sweet not subtle enough  so five bites into it i headed over to pops  life is too short to eat aok water ice when you can go to pops and have the bestvery good food it was cold thou i wish i can order more often but they usually not able to deliver food was very good thou just coldfood good  wings were very good fries okay grilledburnt pita bread and hummus okay atmosphere  not so great  sat at full service bar and i have no idea who my server was suppose to be as a bunch of people kept talking to us but no one knew that we had already ordered and our drinks sat empty unless we specifically asked for refills nonalcoholic  chairs were the most uncomfortable metal cheap stools that ive sat on probably wont be going back anytime soonhows the food here can anyone tell me i stood around in front of two of the cafe workers at the counter for three minutes without so much as being acknowledged so you knowjust wondering
