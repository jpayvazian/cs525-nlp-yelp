had the chicken chicken and it was great the service was good the food is great and the atmosphere is cozy the breakfast menu is great and the breakfast sandwiches are the best it was great it was the perfect place to write an episode my favorite place is the one in the gilliam area twice a week where i go for brunch and i cant wait to go back once the weather is better i usually get the pizza but i just can't get enough of it theres no pretzels either the servers are amazing and they are always friendly and helpful the place is small so the wait is short i would recommend having your own regular table where you can have a lunch and have a seat i usually leave a cup with the other meal items but occasionally i find the cup and the seat specials are very good i usually get one with a pizza and one with a pizza and one with a pizza and one with a pizza and one with pizza and it doesnt take long i would recommend having the only food truck in the area if you are new to the gilliam area and if you dont have a truck in the area and you dont find one in town you can still get a lot of food for a reasonable price if you cant find one in gilliam or if you want to go here it is very convenient and the food is fresh and flavorful the biggest problem here is that they dont have a parking lot we had a waiting room and the waiting area was huge i didnt have to wait long because we couldnt afford to have our parking in the waiting area but they dont really do that well i didnt know how to get there and it took me about 10 minutes to get there the wait staff was so nice the wait staff seemed to appreciate our requests to have a space so i could get my teeth into the damn thing and they were very kind and helpful i also loved the fact", "great staff always helps and i love the prices the only thing that makes me hate the opening is that there are no tables to sit and drink the drinks are delicious and the food is delicious we would definitely recommend this place its a great place to sit or enjoy the food if youre going for a lunch or dinner not too bad for a cafe or bakery the only place i gotta go to never tasted the coffee or the food before the place is clean

the burger the crusty top is so nice and the bottom is so crispy the fries are amazing the fries are still crispy but they are covered with a layer of crispy brown sugar the burger and fries are so good of course they are the chai buns are so good too i ordered the crab cakes and they were sooooo good their crab cakes were absolutely delicious and the crab cakes were so moist that it was difficult for me to put them on even if i was trying to eat them all I also ordered the beer omelets and the wine the crab cakes were so good too but the wine was so dark and tangy the only thing that really made the crab cakes different was the addition of the sassafras which were so sweet it was very soggy and very tasty the crab cakes were served in a few pieces and looked good i didnt get the sassafras but was happy to see that they were fresh and not burnt i had a bottle of sassafras and a bottle of brachios and i was sooooo glad i got the sassafras the beer is nice and good and the

disappointed love the french toast i know it is a cookie but i think that they arent doing it because it looks like theyre doing it the french toast is made with fresh ingredients it is full of flavor and texture and tastes like chocolate but the french toast is thicker and richer and less chocolate this is what makes it so great the french toast is made with freshly made ingredients and not peanut butter but they are doing it because they love it if you are into french toast and want to try it you will want to stop in at this place please they are a new name on the town and it isnt too expensive but the employees are so nice and the food is good with the best fresh ingredients the food is good and i cant wait to go back and get more of its good stuff i dont know it but i was really

bit weary of this place and tried a few items but the only good thing about it was that we had a great time and the staff was friendly and helpful the best part is that they sell all sorts of wines on the menu and these wines are all about the grape varieties and the wines are all aged in old black pines that should be available in a bottle by the end of the year the wine selection here is very diverse and the wines are all made in the same vineyard the wine is all made in the same venue and it is all made in the same wineyard we had a couple of favorites and we were glad that we did the

options for you theres a little picture of what goes on in the back of the building that shows how the food is made that picture shows that everything is made from scratch my favorite part is the

they have a nice white cut on the inside that looks like a car shave or scab but the band is 2 1/2 inches long and the inside is very hard and the band is long and smooth the piercings are a little expensive but i think that they are worth the money i would also recommend this location for your tattooing when you are done tattooing you will have a nice long walk up the road and not to worry

kids are all very friendly i would recommend to anyone looking for a great little place to hold a few drinks as well as an awesome place to take a bite out of our meals we visited the moo to pick up one of our favorite items and we all agreed that the moo was the best place to grab one of our favorite items we still tried to eat there every day for the past year and a half the local farmers markets are still popular and they all have their fair share of locals we might be a little ahead of the game here in not allowing the moo to be seen as a source of food but we were glad we walked away with a sample of toasted bread its the best bread it wouldnt even be a restaurant if there were any other food options in the area we didnt know there were so many different types of bread available at the moo a dozen of them are already here the bakery is a bit overpriced but the service is good we had the scramble crab and the carnitas which are good because they are homemade and each one is made with a different toppings we also had the chicken duck and a slaw if you must have them you could go for the french onion sandwich we will never forget this place we also went to the greek salad and it was better than the greek salad we had at the moo we will not be going back from now on i will come back again and again and again i cant even remember the last time i went here i ate at a moo at the beginning of the month and the moo staff were friendly and were trying to give me a prompt and reasonable rate for a lunch and i was surprised at the response they gave me the best thing

while for my wife and i to get their chairs because they were only about a block away so we waited a long time because we needed them i was so sad and a little surprised that i had to wait so long for

soooo good im going to try the fries and the tea and the vets are super nice i went here with my parents on a big business day in the south and we were going to have a 30 minute drive to see if we could get a seat in the back we found the place at the back of the bus and we didnt have to wait long to get there at the front of the bus just as we were about to get there the parking lot was quite small the bus was parked in the middle of the street so i chose to take the bus instead of walking through the entire bus id be a little hesitant but it turns out to be a fairly reasonable choice for a 30 minute drive and i was a little embarrassed that i had to walk through the entire bus at the end theres a selection of indy food trucks and other small businesses but the fact that they are located close to the bus line makes the total experience a bit of a disappointment its not their fault that they are in the bus they are not parking in the back of the bus but thats not to say that it does not make the experience a little more pleasant the depot burger and yogurt are great the owners are very friendly and the food is delicious and flavorful they also have a nice selection of specialty cheeses as well they also have a great selection of local beers theres a variety of local flavors and wines too so don't hesitate to stop by and try the brewery and the beer selection was fantastic when we walked in we werent disappointed at all the bakery was great the employees were very friendly and the bakery was a great place to look for a bakery our drive through was over by several blocks and we were only able to get the city bus to get there we had a great time and will definitely be coming back to this place and tasting it again the best part of our experience was the

experience we ordered the beer", "i moved from chicago to go to greek you got all the food you could ever want the cant wait to go back again to try some of the other new food trucks in the area good service and its my favorite food to go togreat food its so much better than just sushi and i love the service the service is great and i love the service the line is long and lines are extremely long it is not a big deal but i have never been disappointed the only thing that isnt convenient is the parking station the parking is expensive and there is a line and a line of customers which is a real hassle the entire line is long and lines are extremely long the waitresses are very nice and they do not hesitate to ask for help im not sure how much they cost but its worth it in my opinion theres not much else to say and the food is amazing i would recommendthis is the best chicken in bay area a very pleasant surprise for the owner i hope to return to this place tip for the wonderful service this is a great place to get fresh beef steaks or pork i enjoy eating these croque brussels but i dont like them because of their taste i also love the tasting room the food is always great and i cant wait to try some more if i come back and try it again i would also recommend the fact that there is a wine bar in every corner of the store i will be back again very happy place to go if you love the food the glazed bread is amazing and the place is actually a little crowded but youll find a good deal in there anyways a good bet for this place is to go to the parking lot here you can park in the

from on your menu and they have some of the best selection of soups and sauces in town with prices you can get anywhere from 1 and 1/2 times what you pay for a-la plus for the service the staff is very friendly and has a wide variety of stories to tell and i do not think its a bad idea to ask them questions instead of trying to get yourself in trouble or trying to get you to answer them im a

was going and the mocha and the honey all came out to about 10 and they all taste fantastic the only thing i didnt like was the taste of the sauce and the other ingredients that probably doesnt make a difference but its worth it and the staff has a great attitude to guide the kids through what they are doing and where they are going to go during the day so if you are outside and it is raining or you need a little help getting there you can check out the next section in this guide which i will show you next time if you are in a hurry to get there or want to stop and take a moment to warm up before you head to the parking lot you can find a lot of parking available for a free parking pass which is just a little bit of a hassle to do that you will also find plenty of parking for the kids in general and the kids themselves if you need to park in the lot you can find it at the end of the parking lot the parking lot is just a few blocks from a mall and its not too hard to find and you can choose from all sorts of parking lots and with a bit of planning you can choose from several different types of parking lots and sub with different prices and prices for different types of parking lot we had a few other parking questions we wanted to try out and since we were having a hard time choosing what type of lots to take on our trip to the mall to get home we decided to try some of the most unique types of parking lots in town the best being the apron which is the lady jazz style and will really help you get the most out of your car if youre in a hurry but if youre looking for a great spot to get your car cleaned out or just want to get out of a car that is too crowded at the time i would suggest the apron as the least crowded parking lot in town because its just a few blocks from a mall from a mall and it is open to the public the apron is more of a dog walk than a car ride and its all in the owner is friendly and the parking lot is always a good place to try any kind of item out of the park for you", "i love trying fresh seafood in the area and to be honest it was so good too the eggs and shrimp were amazing too i got a double and it was sooooo good too i really

the chicken salad and breakfast clam chowder and we had the shrimp and grits so there were a few choices but we opted for the shrimp and grits the clam chowder was good but the grits were not my favorite because of the calorie count they were all too good the grits came with a few extra toppings if you chose we ordered the shrimp and grits and the grits were good but not so good that they were any good at all we decided to order the chicken salad and breakfast clam chowder because they were both excellent and we were excited to get the grits it was a bit of a long wait for me and the grits were way too oily and chewy and i had to get the shrimp and grits and it was too late the last time i ordered the clam chowder i was so sorry the shrimp and grits were so too oily and chewy and

disappointed with the cake but it was a great option for us as i had to order the cake again for the wedding to be held in the same room as the cake i ordered the cake was soooo good the table for the cake was a bit large but the decorations were on the inside and the decor was laid out well the decorations were also on the outside but the inside was clean and the decorations were laid out well the decor is the perfect backdrop for this wedding the cake itself is made from sugarcane and the decorations are simple and elegant the decor is so simple and elegant it inspired the decorator to choose the best frosting for this wedding the best part is that the cake is top notch the frosting on the inside is so rich and beautiful it wasnt a bad idea to use a highlighter to make it look more like it came from the cake in my opinion the icing on the outside is so good i couldnt even touch it just a last note i wanted to mention that i was able to make this my first wedding but i had to pay for the wedding itself theres a few things to note the cake was made from sugarcane and the decorations were made from sugarcane but the decorator decided that the cake wasnt made from sugarcane the decor is very simple and elegant the decorations are laid out perfectly the decorations are also laid out perfectly the cake itself was made from sugarcane", "possibly the best breakfast sandwich i ever had i

far from my work the food is good too the atmosphere was all friendly and the staff was friendly i would recommend the takeaway the shrimp deli in the corner is a must for all of us the staff is really cute and the employees are really kind there is no parking in this neighborhood the parking lot is a bit long but it is a good cut of parking on the side of the road the parking lot is neat for a casual lunch spot but it is a bit crowded and there are a few people who must walk away from the lot to get a car to park where they are going if you are going to eat here you can always get a free meal that you are going to be going there for at least a week my boyfriend and i went on a date and were in for a night out we ended up staying at a hotel with a group of guys and our dates stayed there for over a week and they were amazing too i got the big batch of mocha shrimp and it was a wonderful experience the food is delicious too and our server was kind and attentive the sushi was amazing i also got the beef bisque which was good too if you are looking for a convenience restaurant with a great atmosphere then the kimchi and the soup are the very best and i would recommend the

chicken quesadillas are not bad and the fried ham sauce is a little strange but i think it will be the best quesadillas in town i would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good home cooked

its a great place to eat with friends and family the food is pretty good the only thing i dont like about this place is that the prices are very high and i dont get the cherry tomatoes and the prices are so high you can go to 10 for a cup of coffee or less while your looking for a place to eat in town the prices are high because the food is made in the USA we tried the roasted uni beans and the cajun ones and they were delicious so glad that we chose the cajun ones they are very good and the bun is very nice the salad is great and the bread is very good the light and fluffy tomato sauce is so good i wish they made it more cheesey the service is amazing and the food is delicious this is a great alternative to a lot of other restaurants in town the guy who sells you stuff is really nice

elegant and charming place to watch games and concerts and see friends and family and the wine is a refreshing and inviting of the wine the wine is in a bottle and is non-alcoholic and could at least be enjoyed by adults but a little too sweet for children and one of the most unique beers to be sampled in the world i am so happy i have been here for a long time and i have yet to think of a better meal here than the one it was like them and i will say it again it was very pretty and had a great mix of classic and modern dishes an excellent start i will be returning soon and i will definitely try some of their other dishes and tryout the other two they have a really nice selection of dishes and they have a great selection of food too i think the server is kind of a jerk and i had to

really nice to me santa barbera the coffee was really good i would definitely go back if i had to i also would order a chocolate chip cookie after that as a dessert after my first order it was a little hard to figure out what to order the sweets were really good i had the caramelized sugar cookies and the vanilla ice cream it was a little hard to figure out what to order because the chocolate is so sweet but i tried the cookie dough and i was impressed i ordered the chocolate mousse and the raspberry martinis and i got the raspberry and raspberry martinis and the raspberry martinis the lemonade was a little too sweet but they were delicious i think i will definitely return for more dessert the ice cream was delicious and the amount of sugar was nice too since its a little more light

in the shop i would definitely go back again if i had to my favorite part of this place is", "this place was absolutely awesome the chicken was amazing the fried chicken was a little too spicy i guess

one of the best parts of scottishapolis it doesnt feel like a place to park your car or go to the parking lot i have left my car at home for weeks it seems like it is a long time and the parking lot is one of the nicest spots you can find in the city to park a car you may not be able to get there at a reasonable price there are lots of options for parking and you can always buy parking permits in the parking lot and with the parking permits you dont have to wait for the approval of the city this is a great neighborhood place to find some good food as well as a great place to live and work i dont buy tacos or other taco items long before they are on the menu it is very quick you can order the tacos and they are served all by yourself or with your friends i don't eat much tacos but i do eat a lot of gelato and other greek dishes i was told by my friend that the gelato is the best gelato in town now that i know it i have been trying to get gelato but the only good thing is that they are so cheap i tried the gelato at a taco shop and they were so good i had the gelato at a local taco store and it was delicious i will be back the tacos the gelato is made to order and you bring it

of their favorite games with a few groups of kids to crowd around the food was great the only thing that was missing was a bottle of wine the energy drink was too soft for my taste and my nose was a little dry the portions were a tad small but they looked like they were being taken out of the bottle the food was also excellent the wines were very tasty and the portions were sizable i ordered the

always polite and kind i can only hope they are going to be back in the future and it would be cool if i could get the dogs back they are such an adorable group of adorable dogs the only negative I

little while to get the wings it wasnt as busy as i expected they were actually cali breads with a little bread the cali breads were my favorite cupcake and the cali breads were the most delicious i

recommendations from them but i was impressed at how they handled it i wish they would have offered more samples and a taste of the beer and wines but i really love their brews and their accessories

consistently good i personally enjoy the tacos and grits deli sandwiches but the deli has been very busy lately i would give the deli a 5 stars for being excellent the food is pretty good but the atmosphere is extremely small and there are too many people in the crowd to really enjoy eating anything i prefer the dogs and the biscuits the food is also still fresh with a little better flavor but the food is still tasty the location is very convenient and i am still in it for the first time the ambiance is very clean the decor is old fashioned and has been in some places since the late 80s but the ambiance is still very clean and the food is still fresh and delicious the perfect place to sit with family and friends at the canteen i love it i really do i really hope theres a new deli and

a few times and they always come out on a hot day and they always make their own version of the same food my favorite thing about the lady working the counter at the end of the pier at the pier is the great line that turns up and the line we were seated on was too long for me and i ended up going in the other direction and ended up at the pier instead of the restaurant i had been staying at the pier for 2 weeks so i know that it may be a little tough for you but for me it was a very memorable experience i really enjoyed the ambience and the food i was so excited to try the greek salad and

atmosphere than the other places we went here on a rainy day on a hot day we ordered the barbeque and it came with a small jar of cantaloupes which were large and full of sauce the cantaloupes were made with tomatoes on top of a chinese sausage the cantaloupes were topped off with a spicy chicken sauce the cantaloupes were not spicy at all it was just plain the cantaloupes were delicious the

explained the dish and recommended it to me she told me how she grew up in boston and how it was made and how she had been a great friend and cook there for a long time she also explained that the restaurant is owned by the family of chefs who have been there for hundreds of years and that the owner has the highest standards for all of his employees she also called it a day and said she had no idea what to do with the chicken salad i have always been a fan of the lasagna machine and this is the first time i have tried it the meat is tender and moist and soft the pasta is not too thick and the chicken is quite juicy i will definitely try again soon and i will let her know what kind of pasta i use theres just enough room for a large bowl of pasta to be made and the dish i have already made was good the sauce was fresh and rich but the flavor wasnt too strong i highly recommend this restaurant for any food", "i brought my boyfriend here for the first time on a trip to cali i had the

was trying to find some fresh fruit and i stumbled across some really good ones i cant wait to try them umm i cant wait for that to be on my menu i will definitely be trying out their fresh fruit

pretty good maybe the best grilled cheese i tried a banana and it was so good the mango was so good the banana was amazing also the banana was so delicious it was so good i had the crab pie it was bigger than i expected but it was so good and the banana was so good my favorite place to eat is the soft pretzel sandwich i love that the pretzels have a small connoisseur inside it the other guy is a nice guy that will take care of your food the pretzels are a little small but they are worth the wait the pretzel sandwich is not too small but it is a little bigger than the pretzels its a little sad because they were very delicious but at least they were made with real pretzels the rest is history i had the lobster bisque it was so good the", "dave was very nice and we were lucky to see him
