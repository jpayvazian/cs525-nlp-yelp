if i could give it a zero i would i order a plain hamburger and realized they put  bacon in it which i am allergic to and unable to eat after two bites when i went back to the drivethrough window to complain didnt realize the actual restaurant was openit was almost 2 after all the guy took back the burger said nothing and disappeared after 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car he came back and rudely told me i had to go inside to get my food which i did and still did not get an apology  i refuse to go back there after that ordeal which is a shame because its nice to have a variety of places to go to after dt guess freebirds it isservice and management terrible after messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing the manager offered our drinks to be free what a mess the food was cold and nasty didnt even eat half of it and waited over an hour i will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experiencei went here when if first opened and have never desired to go back again i was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food i would absolutely not recommend dining herequality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years in the past  i was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day i have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh but more expensive  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than whole foods this morning i debated on going to wegmans or going to this store i only had to get a few items so i decided on this giant since it was closer big mistake i have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 am in the past but today just me they had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register in my frustration i went under a rope to get soup  i was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing i couldnt even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off if they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours it would have taken less time at wegmans which is where i will shop for now onbummer just moved to this area and this was my first visit to this location  i didnt receive my change or receipt  it was just change but i asked for it and she said she gave it to me um no was in a hurry so i didnt wanna argue  and no spoon for my chili cheese on my burger was old which means my burger wasnt freshly made tasted ok but wont returnwhole family got sick after eating here the frozen yogurt was pretty but did not taste good would not go here again or recommend itonly had one experience with this place and it will be my last i called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but i would have to request it the day of i called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear i picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing i never asked for i called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as its a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer serviceit is unfortunate that with such a unique location and such a brand and product offering this specific store offers such lousy service the wait is endless no one is available to help and at christmas time getting a gift wrap is act of god that requires endless wait i bought gifts and knew that the wait for wrapping would be long so i even left my items at the store to be gift wrapped at their leisure they were not even moved from the counter where i bought them when i returned almost two hours later ready for pick up this was a gift that needed to be given and the staff completely dropped the ball on my time constraints   i love their stuff but today was my last shopping experience at this location couldnt get a gift wrapped after being assured that it could be done in a timely fashion  ill  cancel my card do everything online and try not to go there if i can its really a shamesimilar experience at this place gelato is greatservice sucksa friend from out of town came to visit and we decided it would be cool to go here since they never had gelatoboy what a mistakeday staff coolnight staff not so muchthey acted like we were an annoyance then a customer then whispering and laughing made my friend feels uncomfortableso the young manager pops out from the back and im thinking cool though s guy will make them act more respectableagain wronghe actually joined inthis place had great service not even a year agodont know what happenedick  that sums up my experience at dinardos in one word  dinardos gave me that ick vibe the minute i set my foot in the door though we were greeted by a very friendly hostess the place looked like a run down diner on the interiorand it wasnt very clean or charming  this would have been fine because a lot of times the run down places have the best authentic food but this was not the case at dinardos  at dinardos you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low    our server hated his life and made snarky mean comments throughout our time there which though entertaining was kind of unwelcome and unpleasant  my friend had the mussels which were puny and in an unimpressive sauceunimpressive being the general adjective i would use to describe any given dish my party ordered  i had a soup which was extremely salty and bland beyond that and the broiled flounder and seafood imperial dishes were ok at best   id say if youre looking for good seafood youd be better off at any byob little fish audrey claire anywhere but dinardos  i dont understand how this place is still in business to be honestordered an iced mocha  and an iced white chocolate mocha and they were both was awful  they  had no coffee flavor or chocolate flavor at all very watered down  even went back and asked the girl to add another shot and why  i think she remade them instead of just adding another shot  still had no flavor  not even sure how you could make it that bad  we both ended up throwing them away on the way out  so sad not even worth drinkingthe restaurant smelled like a toilet  i couldnt stand it  my daughter and i got the meals to go and the guy put them in the same box  she doesnt eat fish and that is what i got  i know its a sushi restaurant but she likes the california rolls  i got the spicy tuna roll  it was mediocre  my daughter did enjoyed hers  will not be going backhubby and i were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends we decided for our date night we would give it a try on saturday we pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off we thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in so we proceeded to the door there were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm so we walked inside it was like walking into the twlight zone everyone stopped and stared at us the woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed huh ok so we left it was very akward and unpleasant if they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something  not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there againthis place was awful the first time my mother and i went we were very excited because everyone had been talking about it and we want to support local business the day we went it happened to be pouring raining so we are standing there at the hostess stand cold and wet waiting to be seated not only was the hostess not there no one even acknowledged that we were there the bartender who was right next to he stand was on his blue tooth and only looked our way to flirt with me my mom was so annoyed we just left   the second time we went was because we were going to be in the area and we decided to give it a second try we were seated right away and the music was really good the waiter could have cared less about our table he acted like we were doing him a favor by even coming to the table the menu was thin and nothing to really choose from when he eventually brought the food it was decent my mom hated her salmon cakes because they were overly breaded and poorly season it honestly looked like two pieces of bread   it was overpriced for what we had i would never recommend this place the take out makes great dog food thoughdefine the worst mediterranean food i have ever had  the hummus appeared to have a good texture that is the little bit i could see under the ocean of olive oil  the pita bread was burned not just over toasted but black on the majority of the wedges  i went home and was sick the rest of the evening from the amount of oil it had in it   the manager was probably the worst of the experience he told my gf he would upgrade her hummus for no charge because normally its 100 but said it as if he was doing us this huge favor  he then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation and says please let me know how your food is because thats the only way i can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me  but we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil er i mean hummus  there is also a sign that advertises the cleanest bathroom in town ehhhh ok good to know for our next road tripim a barbecue judge and this aint barbecue  not in texas not in the southeast  not in kc  an earlier reviewer nailed it perfectly  the brisket is fatty pot roast  no evidence of smoke  mushy texture like long braised  meat  my sandwich was 75 percent fat  big meatless chunks of fat  either the owner doesnt care or hes left the place in the hands of employees who dont know any better sorry  but you can do much better elsewherethree chances and they are out we tried to like this place as the location is easy and convenient the bar is great the staff friendly but there is not a dish i have tried that is passable although the asian shrimp wasnt bad but very sweet first visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs on our second visit i ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty no one informed me that they were out of buns but they could have at least tried to dress it up it was seriously a lone piece of ground meat to their credit the manager did comp that meal today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles  we wont be backi find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the daily bread  it is a ripoff of st louis bread copanera bread which in of itself i dont mind at all  i have eaten multiple times at the daily bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience  the food is soso at best  their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor  i also tried the bbq chicken pizza and it was okay    i certainly wouldnt steer anyone away from this place based on the food  the food is basic and simple not bad but also nothing great  my biggest qualm with the daily bread is the service  the majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out  there was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register  there was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line  we waited for a good 56 minutes to put an order in  after receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available  there were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind  does anyone bus these tables  i anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves but it appeared as though the tables hadnt been effectively cleaned in a while  there was also some trash on the floor that hadnt been addressed as well  the order number was called and the order was only halfway completed  when we asked which sandwich was ours we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders   after another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat  i tried both items and as i stated before both were okay  the problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization the slow speed at which we were served or the cleanliness of the restaurant  after 3 attempts im writing the daily bread off and wont return  id rather go to st louis bread co get the same level of food but in a clean environment and a timely settingliterally the worst taco bell i have ever been to the restaurant is filthy the service is awful and they didnt make any of our order correctly and really how hard is that  i wont be back and if i were you i would find a different place to goi know i shouldnt expect much but everything i asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available i was actually afraid of what i was going to get once i did get it i saw the movie waiting  word of advice stay clear of this arch just so you know i was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is thathigh pressure tea sales  good teas but outrageously expensive  try republic of tea or even good old twiningsi had the carrot cake very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder its too bad because everything looks so delicious  also didnt like the chocolate chips in it eitherstopped in for breakfast on 12217 i used to like it here for breakfast  service was slow coffee was not hot grits were only warm and twenty minute wait for cinnamon biscuit after breakfast was brought to table then ten minutes to pay at counter to get out of the place there are better places to get breakfast in the area  should have went with my first choice instead of heresalad was good  pizza is not good  boring tasteless and just unsatisfying  very disappointed  also on a chilly night it is a cold interior  this was my third try there  wont go backnot impressed at all sandwich bar was closed so i ordered a burrito it was reheated in the microwave cost 8 bucks and nasty some sort of cream of chicken and old cheese on top im amazed they can sell this and call it food could have had better at taco belli dont know this for sure but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people come along with me as i journey back in time  all the way back to wednesday  i step foot in this 7 eleven and the first thing i think is this is one of the nicest looking 7 elevens ive ever seen it is very clean bright and spacious very nice looking selection of prepared meals there were many that actually looked like theyd be quite good but i wasnt hungry this day no all i needed were a few items   first some good old tp and let me be perfectly clear as clear as barack obama i dont buy the cheapest toilet paper because im cheap i buy it because i like the way the cheap stuff feels the more like sandpaper the better i like to feel like its working i dont need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there or some perverted freak named scott   in any case i got myself 4 rolls and then i just needed one more thing  some plastic cups for a little party im having this weekend   i go ahead and drop my stash on the counter begin to extract several singles from my wallet when the cashier looks at me and says 2499  i respond thats not right  he points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 1999 i begin laughing i tell him the price is clearly wrong he tells me hes got to talk to his manager meanwhile i tell the folks behind me waiting in line that im just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along before he got back from doing his price check i already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 199 each thats more like it  at around that same moment the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager he tells me that the price was in fact incorrect and that the price is actually 1499  thats the unscrupulous part  clearly that price is also far too high his manager did no actual price check at all he simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less thinking that id be stupid enough to accept this why because im white and youre a racially superior indian you think white people are stupid dont you well just believe what you tell us and fork over our moneyi went in when they had 4 people working waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically water returned it twice but gave up when the barista offered some other iced tea latte they already had instead it was still the same  water the baristas should really really learn how to make their stuff seriously starbucks so disappointed i cant believe i have to give a star  quick rundown  i ordered single with no ketchup mayo or mustard with med fried and large unsweetened teas double with everything lg fries large coke 2 5 piece nuggets side salad cheeseburger kids meal plain with oranges and vanilla frosty ok now for what i got double with bacon no ketchup mayo or mustard lg fries coke single with everything lg fries coke hamburger kids meal with fries and coke right around the time i said no ketchup a blank look came across the face of the employee this is not rocket sciencegreat ice cream absolutely terrible service my son and i went in for ice cream on a sunday afternoon so maybe they have their worst staff working on a sunday we walked in and were ignored by both people behind the counter the girl who seemed drunk was throwing screwed up napkins around and one of them flew over the counter and hit me no big deal but no apology just more hysterically loud laughter and napkin throwing the guy noticed my son eyeing the candy and yelled at him not to touch anything i get it no one wants sandy little hands in the candy but he wasnt touching anything so this was just rude we stood at the counter and the girl begrudgingly served us no smile no greeting she didnt even look at us perhaps she was annoyed we had interrupted her flirting she ran my card and then turned her back to do some weird dance for her work mate while we stood and waited more loud shouty laughter im all about a great fun atmosphere and i know i sound like a bore but when it comes handinhand with a rude attitude towards paying customers it crosses a linethe foods great but no buflight on tapi love the servers there  especially jamie white whose the best server but again lack of bud light is a big negativestore is severely understaffed waiting in line to check out can take up to 25 minutes  avoid this store if possible  the workers are nice but they know they are understaffed to make the profits look better as a strategyi legit just walked into blaze being 9pm and as soon as i got to the line i was told that they are closed im not sure if this is correct as the hours online and on the front door states that they are open until 10pm daily i also checked the website before coming into blaze this pizzeria is new to the area so i was actually pretty stoked to check them out and unfortunately my first experience is not what i expected it would have been courteous for them to give me an explanation for their time change on a tuesday nightfor the time and effort i put into ordering online 30 minutes before my pickup i was pretty disappointed to skip the long line only to be told they didnt have anything in their system thanks for nothingvery disappointed they no longer have the salad  pizza bar used to go to other location all the time moved away  thought they closed then i realized they relocated  was excited about having salad there i loved the salad bar was hoping for a piece of pizza for dinner and some salad not anymore  not unless you want to order a whole pizzathey used to make an amiga bowl that had an abundance of shredded grilled chicken on the bottom of a flour tortilla bowl a layer of rice topped with grilled onions and peppers with a queso sauce drizzeled over the top tonight there was no rice nor any shredded chicken it had been replaced with chicken crisps they are the outer parts of a grilled chicken breast with no moisture and very few of them having met the owner in the past and having his wife wait on me i knew something wasnt right i explained to the waitress that this dish had changed and wasnt good she politely offered something else what to orderif they had modified a basic dish what was next to my surprise a male manager came out and informed me that this is exactly what they had been serving for 10 years and i must have either special ordered something or was mistaken i said this is not what they had served me for the past 5 years and i never had requested a special order before  i also asked what they had done to the phenominal soft tacos they were usually served in a soft warm flour tortilla and had moisture and flavor tonight they were stale and crisp and the filing was bland  again he informed me i was mistaken while he held my order that had been sent back to the kitchen in front of me i apologized and said i didnt wish for anything else thank you another manager came out a few moments later apologizing and stated that they are unfamiliar with what i had ordered and would special order anything i wanted i declined apparently their cook walked out tonight and they were winging it too bad it was a good place to get a good mexican meal two thumbs down on poblanosterrible service called in an order for pick up and completely butchered my order i asked for a half sausage half cheese pizza and felt like he had no clue what i was saying as i had to constantly repeat myself i had my boyfriend call back to make sure the order was right and he repeated back the order that i ordered half sausage half beef so after we corrected him and picked up or pizza we got back and opened it up and it was all sausage this is the second time in the past month i have had terrible service the first time i got there for pickup and they had completely forgotten to put my order in terribleguy at the counter was rude the place was filthy and all around horrible wouldwill not recommend this place at allmy order was 75 wrong and when i got home to divvy out the food i had ordered items were missing including a burgertook forever to deliver and i am just blocks away they claim one driver had ten orders to deliver ridiculous after the almost two hour wait what a disappointment just the weirdest shrimp scampi i have ever had they tried to do too much with it the only good thing was the sweet potato cheesecake i would give the cheesecake five stars and thats the only thing i would ever get from here againwent to this taco bell last night  it was 1 30 and it said 30 minutes to close  all the lights were on  we backed up and forward twice and no one would wait on us  we gave up and pulled up young man was at window closing  register  taco bell was happy to serve usomg what a disappointment today was i have been so excited to see rembrandts reopen after a few months of remodel what i was thinking is that the new owners would want to do more restorations of this beautiful cozy old church maybe try to find more space to add tables but no i walked into a modern cold hospital coffee shop the charm is gone so so disappointed and sad we all love the charm of eagle but it seems to be fading fast please people talk to all the other eagle shop owners when your visiting them especially the old original buildings to keep eagles charm and quaintness and restore these beautiful buildingsthe service was lacking the waiters and waitresses dont know the menu and when you ask for certain things to be brought to your table its constantly forgotten the food is visually appealing but some of the most awkward and distasteful food ive ever had the waffles are stale the biscuits are hard as rock and their chorizo is not real chorizo  the only thing this place has going for it is the atmosphere and their alcohol selectioni dont know what has happened to the in store service in this place  we have been down here for a few weeks now and have been here 6 timesonly once was the order completed without a screw up  today 2 tall decaf coffees took close to 20 minutesby then our bagels were coldfirst i was told the decaf was brewing and then i was told there was something wrong with the brewer after 15 minutes i was offered a decaf americano before we left i politely told a fellow behind the counter the service was abominable and he said well we can only store 2 vente size decafs at a time huh i asked if the management knew about this and he just shrugged clearly this staff has never been trained to make it right for the customerno apologyno couponjust a convoluted story   amazing how you can have numerous people running around a store but you cant get the simplest order straight my next visit to a starbucks will certainly not be this onenothing makes my busy day easy like my iced coffee at starbucks and this location botched it up for me see my photo yup those are coffee grinds at the bottom a whole bunch of coffee grinds yuck yuckget off the phone and serve your customers  also throw out the donuts that are clearly rock hard and inedible   this was my first time in a dunkin and probably my last if its common for employees to be on the phone obviously talking to a friend while making a vague attempt to take someones order it was also the worst donut i ever had mostly because it was as hard as a rock no quality controlafter waiting 40 min to get in hot breakfast served cold food not prepared as requested requested sausage links burnt even after sending them back still not as requested eggs requested as overmedium whites were runny had to ask for refills on coffee waitress seemed apathetic to deficiencies once finished we waited more than 10 minutes to get check long enough to write  review and post this review 40 simple breakfast for twoso i called and placed an order over the phone with pizza huts apparent call center the little girl who sounded all of seventeen was very unprofessional no phone experience she messed up my order and put me on hold whole she had a side bar conversation about her friend finally showing up for work  i say this because when i got there it was a all male crew my order was wrong the lady had relayed a totally different order the poor guy at pizza hut making pizza was so frustrated no his fault i totally understood at this point he apologized and told me he would re make it right now correctly such a respectable man something between who takes the call somewhere else and who relays to the establishment has a disconnect annoying to have to drive all the way backordered the korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap more than half the meat was fat also very little meat overall unfortunately did not like my experiencewalked up with a group to serve 10  parents and kids  after trying to get someone to come to walk up window we left because they were ignoring us 510 minutes and no one else was waiting for walk up servicei went there once years ago i believe i cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels no glove not even paper i dont recall all the details but my immediate thought was its another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversightto top it off the bagels were far from fresh needless to say i havent been back but i realize many people dont care about cleanliness if thats you youll enjoy this placethis place is a disaster in slow motion  i would avoid this place like the plague  most mornings the drivethru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on bloomingdale  the traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible  also the service while my expectations are not high is extremely slow and often incorrect  this location is also not owned or operated by dunkin corporate either so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location no one at corporate can do anything for you you are just sol  i wont even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much dd does have great coffee but this place can mess that up to and has  bad management no pride of work and just not worth the time and moneywhat a disappointment not what most expect with jazz bardining establishment not dark or comfy seating i got a mojito and i do not think they could spare the mint they had a sign about a cover charge at 8 they came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged the food was nothing special it was about equal with zattarans box foods the shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller service was lacking they may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge to add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type the bar was also cheaply done if they do not change they will be gone in six months  hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently pricedliterally walked in here there were 4 patrons being helped i looked at my watch and waited 18 minutes no workers even looked in my direction to try to help nor acknowledge me in that time frame after almost 20 minutes of being the only person in line i walked right out byehorrible service and incompetent employees i created a yelp account just to write about how horrible the service is at this cosi  i work nearby so i have ordered here many times i recently learned that there was an online ordering option which i thought would be perfect because i am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and dont have a lot of time to wait and order at cosi especially during their busy hours  a couple times i have online ordered there were no issues my food was ready when it was supposed to be and i was able to avoid the long lines the other times the service was horrible when you online order the estimated wait is always 20 minutes i always give cosi 2530 minutes to make sure everything is ready so i can just pick it up after prepaying online a few times i have had to wait 50 minutes total from when i online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them my question is what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in  today i online ordered from cosi not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent i went through the normal line and told the employees i online ordered the employee without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at asked me what i got because they clearly had not made my order yet i was ordering for multiple people so i told him i couldnt remember so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he shouldve done earlier i ordered coffees so i went to the coffee counter while i was waiting for my order to be prepared there was an employee busy preparing someone elses order so i stood there waiting an employee from another register asked if she could help me i told her that i had 2 coffees with my online order she then said okay and just stood there i had to ask her so should i just go back to the register i was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee she said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything so i went back to the original register i was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what i needed i told her that i ordered 2 coffees she then asked the employee who i had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees the employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes the coffee sizes online are grande and gigante and she didnt know what those meant dont use those coffee size names if your employees dont even know what they mean in the meantime the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what i ordered while showing me my order receipt he clearly did not know how to read the order receipt which honestly a 1st grader could understand he asked me if i ordered 2 squagels and i said yeah thats what the online receipt you are showing me says i honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this yelp review but i had a 10 am appointment and had been at the cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment do not go hererude and impatient while going through the drive thru it was an inconvenience to ask monica any kind of question wont be back if you dont like your job work somewhere elseworst service in il  lost our order waited 25 minutes for an app   they decided to start cleaning at 8pm  terriblenever going back to a cheddarsmy visit this saturday was a complete zero from the time we walked in the entire place was so very disorganized the owner jerry was screaming at his employees in front of customers and was very arrogant to his dining patrons our server admitted to me that things were not in place and that all of his fellow employees were confused and unhappy after almost 10 mins of waiting for a server to acknowledge we were waiting for service he took our beverage order which took 10 more mins server also communicated to us that no one took the time to review the ordering process with him prior to opening the food did not match up to past experiences at this restaurant we always had paul serve us and he always and still remains an excellent server but his tables were all booked we would have had a better meal at mcdonalds will never return to this hell holeit was first time visiting and i didnt know what or how should i order my burger but the cashier  didnt help me at all she was so unkind and rude i will never come back here again28 for two cheesesteaks and a large gravy fries cheesesteaks nothing to write home about either  if your paying that much the steaks should have been the best go to petes or lennys in the neighborhood youll pay less but get more once this fad dies down the windows will be boarded up and this place will be another fly by night outfitextremely bad customer online support only new vintages that is why they are cheap  they are not interested in building long term clientele their shiiping methods are terrible to say the least  will never used them again  xam miami floridahad the worst experience at dunkin doughnuts apollo beach one car besides myself in line one customer inside had to wait a long time before they would take my order same with the only other car in front of me you will have to wait came from the speaker several minutes later i said hello again  you will have to wait we are busy but we were the only customers wow then came on the speaker what do you want very rudely wow when i reached the window no customers inside the staff acted like they were put out having to serve a customer  im hoping the person that was going to startup a bagel shop will do so soonexpensive bad food and service i have been to other corner bakery cafes and i usually like them but i tend to get terrible service at this one these problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times and getting orders wrong the last time never again i went in it was a slow morning and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs and when they came they were cold i informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and i asked him if they could make me new eggs  he said yes and took my eggs  he came back out with my same plate and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it the toast was soggy and fruit warm i returned my food and have vowed to never returnomg you would think that the drinks would be strong so that you wouldnt notice how bad the food is but no such luck capirihinias taste like dishwater coconut shrimp were burned and the fried avocado was a gloppy mess never againif i could give negative stars i would terrible service no one acknowledged me for over 10 minutes and thats only because i was leaving the other customers told me dont bother ordering because ive been waiting over 30 minutesi would give this place 0 stars if i could we went during sunday happy hour and i specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price the waitress was not apologetic just annoyed when i confronted her and said i didnt know you wanted happy hour i was confused because it is the first thing i asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table  she also rarely came to our table to check on us go elsewhere there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drinki wish i could give zero stars to this poor excuse for a restaurant on the way back from philly to our beach house recently my wife and i stopped in for a sandwich  we were led to a nice booth and greeted by a young girl waitress  my wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some diced tomatoes in it  the young waitress repeated the order back and said of course no problem  i ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would i like it cooked which was odd but i added medium please  i ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order  a full 28 minutes later our sandwiches appeared  my wifes order came with sliced tomatoes no biggie and she just ate it anyway  i attempted to bite my burger and  roll and nearly broke a tooth on the overmicrowaved wheat roll my wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and i explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll  this one was mostly frozen so i told her never mind ill just eat the patty and tomatolettuce  the patty was cardboard but i ate it anyway my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustardketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room odd since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside  she was very timid about offering the explanation and i just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather i assumed an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere  upon leaving i advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since you ate the burger part with no apology or attempt at customer service the waitress got her full tip   i was so angry that i vowed to open a yelp account and did  avoid this place at all costsvery nice delivery driver but very slow service sandwich was less than satisfactory they still owe me a 17 refund from a month ago there were no napkins with my order i am just teally disappointedive been eating here when im in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great the food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish i ate here for lunch today saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me i ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each others food the mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark the pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old this was labeled in the menu as a 1010 spicy rating it was at most a 2 i didnt bother saying anything because of how rude the waiterhost was but ill get to that the rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved the dumplings looked ok but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesnt care about their food the noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it just disappointing really this type of food is supposed to be robust and ive eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out this place doesnt care anymore the man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time he huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when i asked for the real chinese menu instead of the americanized chinese menu and they used to throw shade if you asked for the americanized menu now its the opposite after we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and i decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house they look cool and i like to feed them anyway the take out container was dirty from previous food in it i was blown away especially when i pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed literally stormed off before i was even half way through my sentence i was calm the whole time not sure what this guys deal is then came back with the same container that he washed he washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable i will never go here again and i hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this handy nasty food disgusting food and disgusting people except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us he seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and i assume throughout his life i hate this place and i can only hate it because i used to love itthis place is great in theory but the execution borders on offensive im admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager ali who when i asked why my room wasnt made up despite my  calling housekeeping stopping by the front desk and activating the green make up room button  behaved as though making the bed cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job in less time than i spent requesting the service i could have cleaned my own room worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button a lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on     no one knows the hotel policies or amenities and i got a different answer every time i asked a question   the binder in the room indicates that i can either use the inroom safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk when i asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box they said they had no idea what i was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service the front desk said theres no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho i was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box no one has read their own guest binder   the binder and literature also says there is a pool there is not there is not a even single place to sit or walk outside and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years they could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air since there are no balconies or windows that open   there was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third had they been providing what they claim to theyd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green make up room light had been on for nine hours i dont really care if my bed gets made but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door  call and voicemail to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where i was assured the room was serviced thats just bad management    post script i was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 930 and 1030 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room i did not so much mind being awakened by their work as much as terrified when  after id dozed back off  they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for do not disturb i called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where i left a voicemail its like no one is in charge of this place not hospitable    the gym is decent and security bellmen and casino personnel were all lovelygave them another try today  smdh  how does this place stay open  customer service non existent always out of something or something not working  really dont know how they even stay open  i would be embarrassed to own this locationhorrible service  there for an hour and a half and never got food six tables seated after us got fed and left our server said he didnt know what happened when i asked to speak to the manager i was told he was cooking in the kitchen we finally walked outthe service was so very bad we walked out after waiting half an hour for any food to appear avoid this placei guess it would be necessary to state that i am of jamaican descent and as many of us know it is very hard to find food comparable to back home or equivalent to moms cooking its been some time since i have frequented this restaurant i stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent  fast forward to today i decided to stop by since some years had passed  i ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings  i just have to say that i was very disappointed the oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat more fat than meat and small portions at thatthe rice was stale  but what was really disappointing was the jerk wings i took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken  i just couldnt believe that an establishment would serve thisi assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out they just cant there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food  i was right to stay away for years and i will be doing so againi would not bother spending money on the drinks here they lack the necessary selection for a coffee house even their signature drink is overly and needlessly sweet and lacks any real flavor i cant speak for their food but from what i saw is overpricedwe have loved schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food so when we had guests in town we decided to drive a bit and take them to bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place what in the heck happened to this place saturday afternoon the patio was about 23 full but we got a 3045 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes on top of that we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio fine we will order a few appetizers nope it had to be entrees after promising to make it up to the server and tip well we were given a pager waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty once seated some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad so that made the meal i already had prepared completely worthless the topper was when we got our checks the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies so is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more  i do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events but i was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way i did and actually driving more than a mile to go here surely schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests live and learnwill not return have given this location numerous second chances for improved customer service but have observed no positive changes their drive thru service is terrible both in terms of employee attitude and communication skills as well as their seriously lacking audio technology this location is a complete disappointment and in need of a serious management overhauldisappointed that they wouldnt fill my dogfish head growlers and the beer itself wasnt memorablefood was terrible i ordered through postmates and my order was wrong the food was so bland and such a let down i will never set foot in this place again i asked for aioli on the side of my to go wings nope swimming in aioli i asked for the wings crispy nope skin fell off immediately so soft i asked for extra peanuts for my vermicelli nope got zero peanuts asked for sauce wish i hadnt the sauce for he vermicelli was terrible omg never never never ever again funny thing is when i got my receipt all of the modifications were there i was expecting to pay extra but i didnt bc they didnt do any of themthis is the worst chikfila i have ever been to on multiple occasions i have waited over 25 minutes to get my food their response is sorry we got backed up it seems they are backed up on every occasion they even have the sandwiches premade waiting to go in the bags but somehow among all 10 employees behind the counter they are so backed up that a five minute wait turns to a 25 plus minute wait avoid at all cost much better options at the unioni was in the mood for a quick bite at mcdonalds i thought this was the place to go i went to this mcdonalds and got me a nice big mac fries and a soda cost me about nine bucks no biggie but i told the manager specifically i wanted hot fries from the fryer  but she served me cold fries thats been sitting out for at least 10 minutes i complained but she was mean and rude all i wanted was hot fries is that too much to ask at a mcdonalds she refuse to give me the hot fries and argued with me that the fries were hot reallywow new ownership and they dont care about customers thats for suredont go here for lunch or if you are in a hurry i think this location wont last long with the attitude they have here disappointing experience pastries had the croissant eclair cannoli are okay but nothing amazing dining area is small very limited drink options i agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of breakroom coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buyinbulk tea bags    really what soured the experience was the counter staff  after my so and i purchased several pastries coffee tea and went to sit down the staff informed us that we couldnt stay because they were closing the sign says 5pm this was at 4pm  she assured us that it was just that day they were closing early   no apology just informed us and walked away after all this i had to remind her that i was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in we came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time  i would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign would much rather enjoy a premade croissant and better drink options at the adjacent starbucks or pjs lesson learnednegative 5 stars worst service and slow 15 minutes for 1 panini they use microwaves people so its not even fresh just crap im sure they dont clean them either disgusting get real i will go buy a frozen breakfast sandwhich  cook it my own clean microwave which isnt cooked with everybody elses crap never again will go here btw i waited so long i got my money back keep your crappy sandwhich and enjoyi purchased maverick beef jerky peppered and the natural one and broke my tooth really bad i spoke with them and they suggested giving me a gift card i thought that was ridiculous i suggest that the damn that they call the company that makes the product and see if there was any other issues with other customers about this im sure they didnt do anything about it ill check into it as far as im concerned concerned customercame here for the great vegetarian options but left very dissatisfied burrito was unseasoned nothing inside only rice and black beans i wouldnt come here again  definitely not real mexican and customer service was horriblei went in on a sunday morning to pick up a few desserts for a family gathering at the center city location  i saw baklava and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate and i appreciate her honesty because they were hard as a rock  i then purchased to cakes a pound cake and a peanut butter mousse cake  everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake  everyone took a bite and spit it out  it was stale  the chocolate was ok but the mousse has a horrible rank taste and smell as well  it tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese  it wasnt one of those things that taste like something it was spoiled  even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale  the pound cake was ok nothing special  needless to say the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return againover priced for one  and the lady there is full of crap  i asked where i could get khaffir lime leaves since she didnt have them  she told me that i wouldnt be able to get fresh lime leaves since they dont allow them in the country say what she directed me to two asian spice markets in university city that never even heard of them  i found fresh lime leaves at a thai market in the reading terminal market  fresh   she is just full of crap  and her prices for her spices are over priced  it is catty corner from di brunoswent to winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries it was about 6pm on a weekday spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items stood in a long line for about 20 minutes when i got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said im closed but were opening another check stand one over everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and i was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20 when i got home my ice cream was all melted if this happens again i will walk out and let them put the groceries awayi should have read the reviews before going here i pass tony lukes on the regular sat mornings around 1230 so i decided to stop in for the first time ready to have a delicious war in my mouth from a nice philly cheese steak notdecided to come by with my niece and girlfriend for late night milkshakes lets say from here on out ill be going anywhere but stargate when i called in the hostess was rude and seemed annoyed i was met with the same feeling when we arrived the hostess seemed annoyed that we didnt want to sit and just wanted milkshakes to go we were handed menu anyway which didnt even have milkshakes on them the workers were rude and dirty i felt like i was in a drug rehab not to mention the milkshakes were plain and watery and overpriced 56 a piece springfield diner is leaps and bounds betterripped off  total slime balls  note there are no prices listed on the truck  at least not during the 2nd street festival in nolibs  my friend went there and ordered the fried chicken platter with an extra side of yams  the guy working there told him it would be 14 for the platter and 2 for the side  he said ok ill be right back and left to go pick something up really quickly  he comes back to pick up the food and forks over a 20 bill for he order  they take it and he asks for his change  should be 4  instead of giving him his change back they tell him it is 20  16 for the platter and 4 for the side  sudden price increase  my friend argues with them briefly and tells him that isnt what they agreed to before and he just wants the change  the guy refuses so my friend leaves having paid an extra 4  bottom line dont eat here  theyre dishonest and completely rude  oh and on top of that the food was bland  spent 20 for bland food  shame  no my opinion about the food wasnt biased by his experience  he told me after we ate so i would still enjoy my food and not go out and tear them a new onethe crab balls was good but the food is over priced and they dont give you enough food i wont go back there everthe food is disgusting no beef in fried rice egg foo young gravy clumpy and nasty even the crabless rangoon are way too sweet they are not as good as some of the other local spots china dish what cemented the one star was the rude employees that you have to deal with when asking for basic requests ie bean sprouts when they dont have them and you sub extra white rice and they just open box and through them in on top what a jokeworst location  out there i eat chipotle 4 times a week and every time i go to this location i have a terrible experience  today my burrito with almost no meat put in tortilla fell apart while trying to wrap it he then tried to rewrap it and failed  it came apart again on the third try as well as the fourth  when the fifth tortilla broke in three different spots he still wrapped and gave it to me  also have the ingredients were stuck to the previous tortilla tries  like i said i eat chipotle 45 times a week but ill be going to qdoba after thisamber tried to give us old fries and werent having it cold and burnt we are not the ones get it togetheri would really like to try this place but every time i show up they are unexpectedly closed the first time i showed up i was told they were closed for a spring spruce up and would be open on the 11th i left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website which i had used to look them up and browse the menu i later discovered they had something up on their facebook page about being closed but seeing as those i dont have a facebook this was of no benefit to me today march 15th i drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week this time i checked their facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure in fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the reopening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery i really wish i knew poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like i probably wont be giving these guys a try if i do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again i will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open i suggest you do the samewas not impressed at all we were going to eat st ihop but since the wait time was way too long for three kids we walked over to 5 guys first off the prices are nuts a burger was like 699 and comes with no fries so i thought well maybe its a big burger nope a regular mcdonalds size burger the fries were loaded down with saltit felt like i was eating a pound of salt then i ordered the veggie sandwich im thinking im getting a veggie burger nope its just onions peppers mushroom on a bun super disgusting it was almost 50 for us to eat at a fast food joint and the food was gross  i could have went to mcdonalds and had dessert lunch and breakfast for that price and had a better meal my husband used to work at a 5 guys in sc and as i remember the fries came with the burger as a meal fresh in a bag and the burgers were huge we had to take half of it home  i would not recommend this place at all especially if your on a budgetthis is the worst mexican food ive ever had the salsa definitely comes from a jar my friend got an agave sweetened margarita for 9 and we all thought it tasted like straight agave nectar and water the cheese on the tacos looks like kraft cheese from a bag and the only other topping was iceberg lettuce you might be able to find better food at a gas stationfirst time turkey meal buyer absolutely disgusted the turkey was raw when it was supposed to be fully cooked bloody n slimey and plain disgusting ruined thanksgiving and can never get that day back  best advice  do not buynot very good no salami boiled ham instead of baked no salami more like a miami cuban this is tampa theyre in the middle of a hispanic area so youd expect theyd do it right nope never againi would give them zero stars if it was possible bought my voucher through groupon for the drunk history walking tour we scheduled an entire weekend in philly around the tour we do not live in philadelphia and we have a one year old son my husband works the graveyard shift scheduling an entire weekend away is no easy task we were so excited for this well they cancelled our tour 24 hours before hand 24 hours plus there were no other options for rescheduling that weekend not only that  their customer service is awful it is literally impossible to get anyone on the phone we were told in the email when they cancelled the tour that it was from lack of interest well when i was finally able to talk to a customer service rep through chat  before i even told her what tour had been cancelled she said it was due to a tour guide emergency they cant even get their excuses straight luckily groupon was nice enough to offer a refund in the form of groupon bucks and they have wonderful customer service but best tours is a joke if you book a tour dont bet on the fact that it will actually happen or god forbid plan a weekend getaway around itif i could give them 0 stars i would horrible customer service i order my coffee as follows cold brew no water 2 shots this tote always gives me and issue with this order saying that they cannot make it as follows although the app offers that as an option for online ordering and every other starbucks out there has zero complications with this order infuriatingi dined here yesterday with two friends and we all ordered shrimp and grits when our orders were brought out the shrimp and grits were cold and hard and looked as if they had been sitting out for a while we sent them back and asked if they could send us fresh grits but unfortunately the new grits were the same it was pretty insulting that they would even think that we should eat food of that quality i have visited this restaurant many times in my past visits to new orleans but i will not returnwhen i received my togo order i asked for a couple cups of water and tomato sauce  the cashier said he needed to first take care of customers waiting to order and he would call our number later  even after we finished our food 40 minutes later we never heard him calling again  i think we deserve better when we ordered 35 worth of foodthe worst chicken parm sandwich ive ever eaten the chicken was dry and flavorlessi have a feeling it was not made that day they put a ton of red sauce over it no garlic very little seasoning  and small piece of cheese that was barely melted  i took a few bites because i was hungry and threw the rest out glad i only got the 6 inch would never go back thereblech sorry i have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever  what is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts  thats nasty  and do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk  oh yeah i forgot its every girls dream to sit at a table of fat chicken wing grease covered over 40 balding married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in  but youre the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you dumb ass  this is a joke of a theme restaurant and i am embarrassed to be a human when i see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar  ive been to hooters twice and i dont plan on ever going again  i guess its okay if you just want some beer and wings but arent there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity  even strip bars have more dignity  but like grandma used to say theres an ass for every seat  grandma was always rightthis may actually be the worst falafel pita sandwich i have seen in my life i have eaten a lot of falafel to pay upwards of five dollars for this is absolute robbery and they would never get away with it off campus iv deli marts falafel isnt even that great but it shines in comparison to this do not go herefreaky fast is a joke here  it regularly takes over a hour to receive a lunch delivery from this location  after three instances of this i am done  i will not order from this location againevery dam time we come here its an issue either the steak isnt cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh i try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that the manager dont even care all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away    his name is amonte or something like that  i dont mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous the waitress on the hand was awesomeslow service with an attitude filthy dining and restrooms figured the first time they were having a bad day because i was craving taco bell thought i would give this location a second shot there were two customers in line ahead of me and after waiting ten minutes to order and looking around at the state of the place i should have walked out guess im a sucker for punishment take notice and get this place shaped up we knew we had to wait in line but the wait inside for food and drinks was ridiculous  the waiter took a long time to come she never checked on us and we had to get up 3 times to ask her for coffee and milk refills  the pancakes are just ok honestly ihop has better pancakes  not impressed at allid like to update my review from a few years back my how things can change this place is now a 1star joke the food has gone downhill at all the restaurants the 10 dollar parking is ridiculous thankfully im an elite player so woohoo free parking but my biggest gripe now is this bounce back play is awful how can you truly expect someone who goes through 1000  in 2 days time to be happy with a measly 30 in free play i plan on taking my mom to fresh harvest for her birthday and after that you will not see me anymore id rather drive to immokalee or to the east coastso here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours sometimes 730 sometimes sooner  makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that   the place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill againmy wife and her friends returned to try this place again and her report is that its worse than before  the staff is a bunch of inexperienced kids for whom this must be their first job the food is still crappy but not microwaved the owner will tell you that and the bathrooms and tables are still dirty  what can you expect from a place that got dinged by the board of health for cooking with camp stoves  save your money the place isnt learning from their mistakeswe have been going here for food and beer for a while but will no longer bring our business to pasquallys  the owners allow a loud group of day workers to take over their joint several days a week to the point of fighting and breaking beer bottles  since complaining to the owners has brought no change we will go elsewherecreated order and paid in yelp app got to shop and was asked to pay again explained i paid in yelp app clerk insisted she knew nothing about getting paid spent five minutes on the phone and finally nudged sandwiches to me without even a simple im sorry got home and sandwiches turned out to be disappointing lack of customer service and poor quality of food will keep me from returningthis place was terrible  we had a muffin out of the case that you could have used to play hockey with  i had the breakfast nachos and they used a microwave to cook a fake egg how hard is it to cook a real egg  do not waste your money  i have had better food on a flight in china  coffee and smoothly were adequatedont waste your time or money they can never get an order right they are slow and most of the kids that work there are rudeone star for really nice service  no wait came at an off hour but this place was the worst meal i had in nashville the grits were a massive dissapointment  the cheese wasnt even melted into them and the pancakes werent bad but also werent better than ihop  we couldnt understand the hype and guessed that it maybe has to do with hungover college kids rolling in and appreciating greasy foodmcdonalds what do you need to know   they serve the purpose id complain about the inaudible spanish fellow working the drive through but why would i expect much else  update  they just charged me 25 cents for ranch  im pretty wealthy actually but this stuff is so annoying  i handed him a dollar took 4 of them and walked to the trash can to throw away 3 of them as i only needed one  i feel i made my pointthis mcdonalds is terrible place is dirty employees take too long to take an order they mess up orders and seems like everyone that works here is miserable avoid the aggravation and go some where elseterrible american mexican restauraunt extremely bland food excessively uncomfortable seating  had the fish tacos got food poisoning our chips had hair in it   id rather eat at taco bell even if i had to pay the same ridiculous prices they have at las tortugas 2nd worst restaurant ive been to in my lifehonestly havent left a place more disappointed in my life the service was terrible from the start the servers were very rude and extremely slow it almost seemed like they were all extremely hungover or just stupid after waiting for 15 minutes with absolutely no service we ended up walking out i hear the beer is good thoughwallet was stolen today at this starbucks  the workers there were not helpful at all  they wanted me to file a report to corporate and would call if it showed up  meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill new jersey  and they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items not helpful or sympathetici went in open minded to a place i hadnt heard positive reviews about the reviews are correct broken beaker is a disappointment their display is low grade and simplistic in a bad way there is no glass to separate the consumer from the display which contains dust and cracked glass on the inside i tried the molecule mule and it was nothing but simple syrup and lime for 10 you can get the same thing at marsh for less i was told the tour was great but was disappointed when i had to self guide myself through there back room distillery the equipment has the beginning look of the statue of liberty as the green sets in and equipment shows continual signs on not being cleaned patina is not cool in a distillery would i recommend broken beaker absolutely not unless major improvements are made it does not belong on mass ave good luckdont go here during late night fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 200am and not take your order even though their open 24hrs terribleboth times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours the employees dont seem to listen when we order for example i had to tell one person my order 3 times and when i repeated myself they seemed like i was imposing on them the food is standard for wendys but the customer service is terrible i wont go back which is rather unfortunate because its just down the streeti could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box but i guess i will share my experience first hand  at first i thought it was a farmers market i texted my friend asking her what time we should go so i knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner  i was going to get stuffed at this event  she was dead wrong  when we arrived around 730 we found it super packed long long times tight crowds lots of dogs and babies we circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in and decided on the jamaican truck after an hour of standing in line and having other line goers friends casually jip us we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options  so you know what i had for dinner the evening of night market a bag of chips from cvs  this event had its potential but i guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people most trucks were placing sold out signs just as we were arriving there were very few vegetarianvegan options actually dont believe any food vendors had vegan options hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinkstruly awful i chose this as my birthday lunch place with a friend the counter clerkmeal maker was disinterested bordering on rude this is a small place so four dirty unbussed tables are noticeable after cleaning our own table we waited and waited there was no one ahead of us finally our paninis were served both were badly burned who serves burned food unless you just dont care the salad was bland the coffee was finestopped in here with my wife and a friend for lunch today and let me tell you it will probably be the last time i visit this location  i normally love qdoba but this location down right sucks from the ride ass customer service to the cleanliness its just all around terrible ive never had a person whistle at me from behind a line and say excuse me what would you like to eat youre kidding me right  and plus look at my pics this chick had her hair dangling down in front of her face and swaying back in forth and prepping food are you serious what happened to having it covered up i wont be back to this location to easy to get sick or catch somethingto many changes to an awesome place has made bottle works a thing of the past for me  removing favorites from the menu  raising prices  and promoting only buying local whilst not using items not produced in house as a new goal are very confusing  sad to see this happeni usually stay away from restaurants on piers since most are tourist traps but went to this one since it had so many good reviews calm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick  it is ok not as good as some reviews here claim  crab cakes were also ok  the shrimp and scallops pasta was awful  small shrimps and scallops definitely not fresh  it was also sour either from some wrong ingredient or some overdue saucemy husband and i ate lunch here a month ago and the experience wasnt the best we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and we heard our waitress complain she was overworked right in front of us i doubt we will be backif i could give this place a zero stars i would what a waste of my time we waited for a seat our server female with dark hair never told us her namenever brought us bread i asked her 3 times for plates when the other server finally brought us bread  she screwed up my kids calamari with no parsley on it and never put in my order or my husbands orderwe literally sat there for over an hour with no food i finally asked for the manager and he told us then that he was making our order the priority for the chefi got up and walked out im a chef i would never have sent calamari with something someone specifically asked for there to not be on it the server put the calamari in as an appetizer even after i told her it was my daughters diner what a terrible experiencei will never eat at this restaurant againand i will tell everyone i know what a horrible place this ismy fault for falling for the 699lb filet or maybe another cut it was a month ago and i cant remember that specifically and buying 2 one for me one for fiance  shame on me for not cooking it on the day i bought it apparently  because when i did go to cook it the next day yes thats right it had turned brown and smelled awful  note that the other items in my fridge were fine including other raw meat so i suspect this was on its last legs when i purchased it  did i worry about being able to return it  noi go in there all the time laziness and convenience and in fact had been there 4 times that weekend because i was baking something and kept forgetting key ingredients   so i went in without my receipt to ask if i could exchange it for a fresher piece of meat i really had my heart set on steak  tito the manager gave me a super hard time about not having the receipti explained that im not used to having to keep the receipt in case the food i bought was spoiled but he didnt care  he then proceeded to tell me that maybe it was my fridge that i really needed to receipt and to generally balk at my attempt to politely receive a refund or new steak  finally he gave in and i got 2 new steaks but that wasnt the end  he stopped me to inspect them on my way out and started saying again how he thought i had either left them in my fridge or my fridge was broken  i commented that if i had the same issue at dibruno brothers i wouldnt be put through this grief to which he responded well we arent dibruno brothers  no shit  i emailed them and commented and of course heard no response  i really wish that the little grocery at 20th and spruce was better stocked because i this place blows and i dont enjoy going there  gahservice sucks  we had a party of 12  we couldnt get enough chips  we got 1  i ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips  we couldnt get drinks  waitress couldnt keep focused on each person and was very scattered  wont be back for the spendy mexican foodwaited 1 hour for a simple salad this place takes forever to bring out your food the service is slow and horrible  i had to ask for my salad to go since i had a plane to catch  when i was able to finally eat my salad they forgot to put a side of salad dressing needless to say my salad was awful  there are plenty of other restaurants you can go to dont waste your precious time and hard earned money on this dumpthe manager of this mcdonalds needs to teach the help the big mac jingleit starts with two all beef pattiestwotwonot one freakin patty you idiots how can you forget to make a big mac and forget one of the burgers its not rocket science also the slowest and dimmest counter help to take orders they take one order at a time and then bs with the help next to them while the lines get longer   so the advice is to make sure you ask for everything you want them to put on a bun for you or it will be missingjust went here for breakfast  the food was just ok the service wasnt particularly great in fact our server seemed fairly put out anytime we asked for anything  what really made this a one star experience  though was the 6 or 7 year old boy who was not a customer possibly our servers son who was hammering away on the piano the whole time we were there   we asked our server to ask him to take a break and she was not thrilled but said ok  she said something to him and he stopped for about 30 seconds  then right back to hammering on the piano keys   who wants to pay for breakfast and have to listen to someone hammer away arbitrarily on a piano will never go backalthough i live a stones throw away and love the concept i can no longer support this establishment the food is just too inconsistent and despite the reasonable prices subpar quality i guess its still better than goldies but sylvan park deserves betterfirst off the bathroom smell like dirty seafood which almost took away my appetite to start with we order the king crab and lobster tacos there was hardly any meat in the king crab and considering that it was more expensive than the 3 pounds of a different kind of crab you would think that there wouldve been plenty of meat my lobster tacos was over an under cooked but the next two days hunched over the toilet so disappointedyikes i just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins chinese restaurants for you bad very bad the worst the steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close and i should have known since no one was in line at wendys most disgusting fast food ive ever experienced crazy that this was the absolute worst garbage fooddont bother going  the servers are too busy dancing to take your order  waited  30 minutes and never had our order taken    but the servers danced two songsrecently moved near this mcdonalds location went one night and they messed up my order knowing that mistakes happen and wanting to give them another chance my kids and i went back a few nights later it wasnt until i got home that i realized that they completely forgot to put the cheeseburger in my daughters happy meal they did replace the full happy meal and gave us free dessert but i wont waste my time going there ever againthis place is just awful great atmosphere but food is just plain bad ive given it too many tries donelooking for a hard to find book january 9 for a one year wedding anniversary for my wife that i bought a kitchenaid mixer for the special kitchenaid mixer cookbook showed instore availability yes i know how to search within a store to see if its actually there i pick the store i checked the availability within that store it said in stock limited quantities im only a half hour from there but it was rushhour traffic i get there and looked everywhere for the book and i do mean looked everywhere i finally gave in to ask someone to search for this books location or these books this guy behind the information desk said im looking in the warehouse not in the store i showed him where it says this particular store in store in stock etc complete with store number and address he continued to argue with me that it just means warehouse it just means its in the warehouse its just in the warehouse seriously if something says available in a particular store and in stock with a green check mark next to it that means for all you people out there dont waste your time trusting itgo to barnes and noble i cant believe how stupid these people are by goading people to come into the store just to create more floor traffic i will never frequent the store again and i will make sure this review makes it to every internet site i can put it on i was seriously pissed off at their lies yes i know its only a book but i sat and googled every possible bookstore all over the place and that was my closest possible store to pick it up especially during rush hour traffic i must say these people are serious douche bagsi ordered the 1st day they were open from grubhub for carryout they accepted my order and said it was ready before i walked in i walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine and they were getting it for half price   i watched 9 people come in order and get their food before me but pay half what i did because i ordered online i sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that i ordered ahead of everyone else there paid double what they did for their food and was confirmed that the order was ready  i was apologized to frequently for the wait but at no point was i offered any explanation as to why i waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter or why they told grubhub it was ready or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter delivered i would understand but i picked it up   i live a block and a half away 315 n senate i had hoped it would be a place that i could carry out from often but i was thoroughly disappointed all said the food was ok but the experience was absolutely horrible due to that experience i would recommend either bento asian mostly japanese 250 delivery or the china king at 148 n deleware free delivery for asian delivery or carryout do not order here from grubhub or any other caryoutdelivery appsiteplaced a to go order had to repeat it multiple times over the phone and it was still wrong when i picked it up unfortunately i had little time and didnt have time to have it fixed i was not offered anything but excuses and unfortunately i do not think i will be returning because of this experienceordered from grubhub waited an hour and a half for delivery so i called naturally no one picked up for another 20 minutes then when the guy answers his explanation was that they were on break and hadnt made my order yet and gave me the  oh well attitude and didnt offer any kind of compensationthis place has gone downhill in a hurry  when it first opened the donuts were actually good and had creative toppings  now they have creative topping but the actual donuts dont taste fresh  they have opened up a few locations and now the quality at the original location isnt theredont go on sundays i want to like this place but they wont let me tonight was the third time after two eh trips the food is good the presentation is very bad the taste of the house margaritas is a selling point however you get 4 oz of ice and probably 3 oz of actual margarita if youre lucky the service is not good there is no accountability from management or servers i was told its not my fault guys tonight 82414 that i had to wait over an hour for food i never received my refried beans and rice so that made it sting a little more to be overpaying for a mediocre experience      i wanted this place to open and be awesome but it seems like all they did was open more classic dishes need to be added prices need to be evaluated and customer service and staffing needs some serious attention i may give it a shot after some time has passed when the kinks may be worked out i have no intention of going back until i hear something different  even then its going to be hard to drag me in there again this is a bummer because i want to like this place and give them my money and feel good about iti used to come here a lot however i will not be coming here very often in the future because the customer service seems to be lacking my online order did not go through and this was very disappointing they made me stand in line again and reorder my food and did not offer me any type of discount or compensation for this disservice i asked to speak to the manager who also did not offer me any kind of compensation they dont seem to care about customer satisfaction instead they were fine with the fact that my online order did not go through so if youre reading this panera please take into account that you should work to satisfy your customers we order online because we have small kidsprobably the the worst place ever still didnt get all that was ordered the picture of margarita is just a picture of ice  and margarita mix wow only 1 waitress  was not but maybe 5 tables to wait on would not recomend coming here  will not returnif i could give this restaurant 0 stars i wouldnt hesitate for a millisecond  i just finished eating at ru sans with 3 other people  one of the people in my party didnt even receive their food until we were sitting at the hostess stand waiting to leave granted the waitress continually reminded us that it was only her 3rd shift but every mistake was inexcusable  we walked into the restaurant at 830 pm during the time we were there our order was messed up several times random food was brought to us many times and we were constantly asked if we had ordered it or not we had to remind our waitress several times what our order was additionally when we stopped her to remind her that we had been waiting 30 minutes for certain items she argued with us by saying that she had already brought it  if she had actually brought it then it would have probably been in the pile of dishes that littered our table which another waitress came by to clear at the end of the meal  of course the one dish missing from the dirty junk on our table was the plate that should have been the trash for the shells of two orders of edamame we had  even though we waited one hour and a half for one sushi roll all we got was a simple sorry never once did we ever see a manager even to ask if we needed anything or to apologize for the completely ridiculous amount of time we spent at our table having been in the restaurant industry since i was 16 i did feel bad that our waitress colleagues simply let her drown unacceptable  when we left it was 1020  the cherry on top one of our guests had to smash a bug crawling up the wall  of our booth  do not eat at ru sansi had gotten a strawberry banana smoothie right before my airplane i drank almost the whole thing but started to feel my stomach getting uneasy the next day woke up with food poisoning from this smoothie everyone stay away if you dont want to get sickthis is my second bad experience in a row at stefanos tonight i waited over 45 minutes for a callin order they said would take 15 minutes then they were out of greek dressing and told me theyd been out for a while  how does a greek italian restaurant run out of greek dressingwe recently moved within walking distance of the store  on my first visit i found the employees to be no so friendly  they didnt make eye contact say hello can i help you nothing  i brushed it off as just a bad day  today i went back and that will be my last time the deli lady and the cashier were the only employees that spoke to me or make eye contact for that matter  the people that look like managers dont smile or speak  the bag boy was hanging on the coke cooler door when i went to the register  he piled can goods on foil pans that i bought and when i asked him to move them he said well i didnt bend them  no one offered to take my groceries to my car either  ill drive the extra miles to shop at the publix on alderman and alt 19 in palm harbor  those people always go out of their way to be friendlyof course we know it is not las vegas but per tripadvisor figured it would be worth going to sum it all up its a castle of secondhand smoke  we are non smokers and have gone out to clubs which had smoking and could tolerate it more than this place   we were very disappointed that we could not enjoy ourselves for all the smoke soon as some hit the door they were lighting up cigs smh why not invest in some of  those high power fans to vacuum some of this smoke out we were not the only patrons cutting our visits short because of this   nice looking hotel and heard the buffet was delicious yet sadly we will never know doubt we will  ever come back unless it changes to nonsmoking or clear divisions of smoking and nonsmoking areas oh well can not win them all maybe if some happy competition moves in town things would be interestingoh boy where do i begin how about with a warning dont waste your  here stay away   first its just plain ole too expensive period  second the product is so average its embarrassing fries were soggy steak was chewy bread was ok  finally the service and systems are a total cluster where do u stand wheres my food what is going on why did i come here  the place looks great  it talks the talk unfortunately it fails to walk the walk in any wayfood is good but dont try to ever call in for takeout  every time they put you on hold and dont come backservice sucks here around noon been waiting over an hour for a simple breakfast for 2 the food smells great if i could only damn well eat it like for real ive seen like 4 groups walk in order eat and leave and we havent got anything yetthe food at this qdoba was standard but the service was horrible  there were three people behind the counter and none of them wanted to help customers  there was no one in line and two of the three just kept standing at the sink talking to each other even after the third employee tried to call over the person working the first station  we waited and waited and a line of 3 other couples built up before the gentleman at the first station finally sighed loudly and walked to his stationi came here with my family today with total of 5 people  service was decent and food was okay when the bill came i noticed there was 18 gratuity already added to the bill i questioned the server where this automatic gratuity info was posted since it was no where to be found inside the restaurant or on the menu   she told me the gratuity info was posted on their website  i told her people dont go on to the website to look for this info and i felt cheated  after i left i went to their website and looked for the info well it was no where to be found  i called back and asked her to direct me to this info on their website and she then says its posted on yelp  i told her  yelp is not your website and i am going to call my credit card company for dishonest business practice she said if you come back now i will refund your tip i told her i already left and cant and will not turn around  she said well then we cant do any refund  after going back and forth another lady came to the phone and i told her i will give my cc number and she will run the refund   look on yelp and there is no info on the gratuity  what a dishonest restaurant i normally tip at least 15 and i just do not appreciate this kind no of practice  when did it become automatically adding 18 for 5 or more  isnt the norm for party of 8i cant believe this place gets ratings higher than 2 and people continue to eat there the food is not good at all i have accepted the fact that nashville suffers a food void but this place is grossover price and pretentious hipster food  4 bite of nothing on my small tasteless snapper  the carnitas my daughter got where tastelessi went to the drive thru hopefully i can get served so was at the speaker for half hour and lady had a attitude cause we asked if we could get service to say they had to change till and several cars left in the process i had to go home hungry that was totally sad luckily i not a diabeticlet me start with the positives this little restaurant doesnt look like much from the outside but its very cute and quaint on the inside our server was polite and friendly he kept the soda refills coming and did a good job overall however this is where the praise ends  i went to this restaurant because i was in the area and wanted some italian food i saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty be warned it is way overpriced and the food wasnt even good the mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store they were 799 for five small sticks not worth it then came the entrees everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious my husband ordered chicken parm and i had the baked ziti it was awful i mean not good at all his chicken was ok but not crispy on the outside like parm should be mine didnt have the brown bubbly cheesy top youd normally see on baked ziti the mozzarella cheese was barely even melted the sauce tasted like it came from a jar it was weak and not very flavorful i had about five bites and didnt even take my leftovers home for the kids   save your money and go to olive garden instead i like to support local businesses but this was an unpleasant dining experience let me say again it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just bad i seriously left there wishing id gone to mcdonalds insteadway too hyped upserver was too worried about getting closing work done and left her tables waiting forever also with a kitchen thats open for everyone to see maybe they shouldnt touch all the food with their bare hands we tried to go here on a sunday night before a concert  got there at 630 were on the no wait app  said it would be 40 minutes max we left at 740 had not been seated and was told the kitchen was behind  the last time i was here it took a long time to get our food  i do not recommend this establishmentmaybe i should not have expected much from a sushi joint in nashville i mean really its as if id been let down because a cuban restaurant didnt live up to my miami standards i didnt come to nashville to eat sushi but i really craved it while i was in town and my girlfriend who was showing us around said shed been there a long time ago and remembered that it was a buffetstyle place in a great location  done deal we get there and she was right about the area the food was quite underwhelming nothing tasted very fresh in fact everything i got from the sushi buffet was soggy and maybe even slightly warm not good for uncooked food they do have a small sake selection of sake of which we enjoyed an unfiltered bottle of the price for 3 people eating from the buffet 1 small bottle of sake and 1 sapporro came out to just over 70  not a place id look forward to going to again i wish i could give it a better review and ratingnot happy at all we had been waiting outside while its cold and raining for about 10 minutes when a group of regular customers  walk up and go get a table before everyone else that was waiting those regulars were out side bragging about how they didnt have to wait like everyone else forget the fact that im pregnant i have two children with me there were four groups of other people ahead of them the young guy who calls people in lied to our faces when i asked why they were seated before the one that had been waiting for awhile i physically saw them pull up in there vehicle and walk up so i know for a fact they were not here before us thanks to them not only my family but other families with very small children had to wait an extra ten minutes this will be our first and last time here i do not recommend coming here if everyone its treated fairly very poor customer serviceworst restaurant experience ever first this place is super cramped the noise level was atrocious i dont know why they havent done anything about this we could not engage in an enjoyable conversation  second my plate had dried up food on it from the previous guest i understand that can happen but nevertheless yuck the service was mediocre third the food was loaded with salt my husband has high blood pressure so this was a major concern to me i took a few bites but didnt finish and definitely didnt bother to take home you cannot enjoy the flavor of the food because everything was drowning in salt gross fourth our bill was extremely high this food was definitely over priced for the quality  the dessert was decent but the thing that put the final nail in their restaurant coffin was the roach that grazed over my high heel on my way out i wanted to die never again dont waste your time or your money and they seriously need to hire an exterminator nowdo not waste your time ordering take out  ive waited over an hour and received the wrong order twice now  this place stinksmini size boonguhbbang for 2 photo looks like regular size  false advertisingthis is a big store and is open 24 hours but the customer service is absolutely terrible cashiers have an attitude and the pharmacy is never prepared when going through the drive through to pick up prescriptions you will have to wait at least 15 minutes for someone to even address you and then another half an hour to pick up your prescriptions they should not only hire more people in the pharmacy if they need help but also change their attitudes towards customerschanging this to a 1 after i just had to pay 10 to park seriously   not like they arent making any money on anything else in therethe gelato may be very good but i cant remember after such a negative dining experience  with the exception of one person the owner the staff were pretty missable  not a single smile to be had  i dont expect my behind kissed or even small talk but i dont expect to give business to an establishment that hires people who seem bothered to be there  there are three tables inside with ample room for a few morenot very family friendly  me hubs and three children under 3 waited patiently for a table  the icing on the cake was other customersa lady practically climbed over my daughter to grab my hubs seat when he got up to use the bathroom  seriously  not the establishments fault but all around poor attitude and rudeness abounded  we wont be returning  if you have children pass on this place and enjoy ice cream at homedont waste your money and time although they have an attractive price of 21 for buffet but its a rip off i came here with my family tonight it was a get together and we had 24 people in our party we didnt expect too much since the price was very reasonable for sushi and korean food however we were extremely disappointed by the quality of the food nothing tastes fresh and thats pretty scary when serving sushi additionally most of the trays were either empty or only had little portion of food on them we saw other tables eating raw oysters but when we went up to grab some there were none we then waited and didnt see any come out for 20 minutes we then asked the waiter to check and after 45 minutes a chef brought about 10 oysters out he then said thats it no more in a rude tone of voice when my aunt asked one of the chefs if he would bring more out these were his exact words this is a buffet not oyster buffet we asked the waiter if we could speak to the boss and the waiter said that chef was the boss really thats how you treat customers im pretty sure they wont be in business for long i suggest going elsewherewe shop at acme pretty frequently today we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out pasta salad cheese etc we noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store i also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang and rang and rang with no answer   well when we got back  they were already reshelving our items my husband had to go around the store and track everything down   are you freaking kidding me youre telling me that they dont even wait for people to return before putting purchased items back to sell again theres seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return   it was honestly a span of 20 minutes thats ridiculousi love vedge and was really looking forward to wiz kid for vegan takeout in my neighborhood huge disappointment  very few healthy options note see all the reviews about the fries it may be tasty but i cant say because as a healthy vegetarian there was nothing appealing for me to order i stopped in on several different occasions in the hope of finding some additional menu options but no luck at all really too badafter a 90min wait we were told it would be an hour i went for dinner with my sisters the food was just okay and overpriced the polenta wasnt the best ive had the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls and if theyre going to be vegetarian there should more more not less of the meat ones the cauliflower was pretty good but again not worth the price   but let me tell you about our service first the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters they got a red cab mendoza a white chardonnay was delivered nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food then one of my sisters pulled a really long hair out of her mouth after taking a bite of food when we alerted our server his response was ew ill be sure to tell the chef  never did we get an apology nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check and on top of that he charged us for the red and the white wine the sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off regardless of my urging her to do so alas i decided to share this review that hair was long and nasty   no way will i return what a shameno military discount for my son headed to kuwait to serve our county shame on you all all other places were happy to give the standard discount unacceptablebiggest group of dunkin donuts idiots i have ever come across in my lifeworst service ever we were really excited to try this place out as everyone raves so much about it my sister lives here and while i was visiting we decided to try it we waited in line for about 30 minutes i understand this is popular so its fine we waited for a long time while we were seated waiting dor our food while everyone around us who came after us had been served food isnt as expected quality sucked for what you wait for ihop is way better dont waste your time we complained to the manager and all we got was im sorry no actions were taken on the management side disappointed will never come here and not recommendednot impressed with this locationwe to the drive thru yesterday to get a wonderful shake the lady was taking one order at a time i mean you order you drive to pay and then when that vehicle leaves the property then the next person goes thru the same process kinda reminded me of when employees are not getting what they want so they cause a slow down so i went inside thinking id get faster service it was 92 degrees on a saturday night went inside a customer said they only have a total of 2 employees working here needless to say i didnt get my shakei went back t h e next day today sunday and ordered my shake i was told they were out of shakesi asked when they would have more the lady said she didnt know went there the other night and the service was horrible girl behind counter yawned in my face than said what you want seriously thats how you ask to take my order wow trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed our turtle sundae didnt have any caramel in it  you know one of the main ingredients my christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted  total bargain basement still frozen so bad even a little debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade  the smore was a pretty light on toppings pretty sad excuse not going to waste my money here again thats for sure will spend my money  how sweet is this  fritzs for now on where i actually get what i pay for and moredo yourself a favor and never ever order the breaded chicken it was served black extremely overcooked to the point where i started to question what kind of meat it actually was as far as the texture  it would make a nice hockey puck for the nhl it definitely might not be one of their more common orders but take it off the menu if you have no idea how to make itordered delivery through postmates to be delivered to our hotel room the delivery guy was very very friendly however the restaurant did not pack any utensils or napkins please be mindful when you are packing the foodthis place is smokey and insane8 dollars for a drink at center bar  even if your playing the bartop machines i know its not vegas but come on some ticketsvouchers i had from a month ago with money on the expired why is that even the stupid slots would not take em i had to go to meet a friend who spends a lot there i was coughing my brains out from the smoke i was stressed the whole time i was there  as was my wife it used to be fun now it suckswe eat at some of the restaurants weekly  but we are done now they want to redo the lot and charge to park  what the hell is wrong with these greedy indians or whoever is running this scamtalk about driving people away i know they dont care because its always packed house the clientle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes the parking garage is nasty like new jerseygarbage all over  stinks gum on the ground just shit now should i tell you what i really thinkwent there for brunch today unfortunately the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook and she was sooooooo slow  she overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner stationthe absolute worst sat for 20 mins at the counter waiting for a tuna sandwich staff isnt friendly place is old and dirty its insane how good this location could do if they got their act together horrible  i miss billy gsi visited just cookies to get some chocolate chip cookies for a friend and i before a concert at the awesome murat  specialty bakeries are the best unfortunately this place was the worst  for cookies at this price they should be better than the discount dayold cookies at the supermarket  much better even  but these were somehow worse  not just dry but bland  i couldnt believe that a bakery specializing on just one item could do them so poorly  and while the woman was not explicitly rude she certainly wasnt friendly either not even a smile  to just cookies ill just say nototally nondog friendly unlike 95 of manayunk   ashame since its accross from the dog park  ill be giving my  to the dog friendly main street market from now onwent on the cupcake and macaroon tour last weekend  we went to four places  the first business was a glorified coffee shop  no cupcakes or macaroons we were given half of a ricotta cookie  although delicious it was not a cupcake or macaroon  the second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake they did not have enough of each flavor so when it was my turn the one i wanted was gone the third establishment was so awful they should have paid me to try their sample  it was a vegan bakery free of gluten dairy nut soy egg and any other allergen one can think of  i am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them but im not sure why this establishment was included  how can a cupcake taste good after youve removed all of the key ingredients  the last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons  we were told they ran out and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake  how do i know it had been frozen and not fresh  it was still partially frozen in the center  luckily it was a beautiful day to be outside because this tour left a lot to be desiredgaetanos used to be one of the better spots in the area not saying much to grab a good quick lunch id stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily  well they completely ruined that gone is the rotating reasonably priced lunch menu theyve since replaced it with a menu that isnt even worth ordering off of they regularly had specials of sandwiches wraps and salads on the lunch menu for under 7 that came with chipsfries and a drink all but one item on the menu includes a drink now and i just paid 901 for a buffalo chicken wrap tiny bag of chips and soda i had to buy separately whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didnt have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu i got a 9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else it was smaller than the premade wawa wraps huge change in what gaetanos used to be their portion sizes were always their strong point  i posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special i got before they started cheaping out on their offerings i wish i took a picture of my pathetic wrap today they couldnt look more different i didnt have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us dont have all day  ill be looking elsewhere during my lunch breakaw man i was hoping id previously posted a glowing review of rusans so i could prove that once upon a time i liked it here but i didnt so just trust me on this one  it is with a heavy heart that i relay todays experience over the lunch sushi buffet cold gelatinous and 11each its been a year or three but i remember this being so much better dont get me wrong i love cheap fast foodish ethnic cuisine and i have lovely memories of the ginger simmered beef fried garlic and bay shrimp salad maki like i said once upon a time but today lackluster is an overstatement  with each bite i kept hoping the next would be better but alas it wasnt   why rusans with all your new neighboring restauranteurs in the gulch is this the taste of complacency i shake my head in disappointment because i know your potential and cherish what we once had   on the upside my water was refreshing and the service was fineordered food at noon waited 55 minutes for two salads friend ordered house salad when it arrived it was spring mix red onions cucumbers no cheese bacon tomatoes pecans when questioned response was the chef changed it without asking the customer and to whatthe only items we have prepped asked for the manager but was told she was in the kitchen  guess that sums it up obviously will never go back  one day later update a marketing team member reached out to apologize and offered complementary meal as his personal guests should we want to try again hope this is indicative of a team trying to right the ship stay tunedmy first time coming here was super awesome so i decide to bring my mom for my second visit unfortunately i was so disappointed and mad that i took my mom here for lunch we waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up  might come back for the drinks but not for the foodwhat kind of business do these guys run they dont update their website and they dont tell you where the truck is located its a shame because i was craving some korean foodtour guide preston was late then spent the next 15 mins on the phone not organized he spent most of the time stalling because the next restaurant wasnt ready food was ok definitely had better at other local places not worth the money even at groupon price highly disappointingi was here before once didnt have much of an impression i went back again this week with my friends we were very disappointed we ordered this grilled whole fish it came out in a big pot with vegetables looking like left overs the fish was about the size of one hand but it only had half of the fish served  the dish was 30 we four each took one bite and it was gone i went home hungry i ordered a take out for my husband the serving size was about half of the same dish i ordered from the other chinese restaurant  i felted being robbedexcited to try this new nice looking burger place in town and finally got a chance eat there  very disappointed its it set up as a fast food restaurant but they charge like a high end operation missed the mark by a mile the burger was expensive side were severely overpriced fries were boring ordinary and werent very fresh the bright spots would be the fried zucchini and the ghost pepper cheese i will stop at red robin next time for better service better food and better valuesome of the more creative house dishes looked good and inspired like the chicken and waffles and the burger but for vietnamese food it was just ok  we had the avocado fresh rolls and they tasted just ok and the peanut sauce was not great  the real upsetting part of this meal was we had a vegan in our party and they asked the waitress what on the menu was vegan and she pointed out all the tofu dishes  ok good start  both the meat eaters and on meat eaters in our party have options  the follow up question she asked was  that there were absolutely no animal products in any of the tofu dishes  the answer she got was no animal products  after ordering the tofu vermicelli she found out it had fish sauce on it and told the waitress  the waitress sort of stared at her blankly and didnt really know what to do  eventually we just asked to see the menu again and asked if the  sate veggies was vegan  the waitress explained it was veggies with a lemongrass and spicy sauce  the waitress said yes it was vegan  she sked if they could make it less spicy and was told yes and so asked if she could have that instead  when it came out it was steamed veggies with rice  no sauce nothing  some of the veggies had brown spots on them  this was sent back and we went to lost love after for pho  with vegan diets being so popular it would make sense if the staff knew their menu better and the chefs were able to actually cook something inspired for their guests with simple restrictions  we went to bhava the night before with someone with a nut allergy and the chef made  an inspired dessert for them on the spot because there was no dessert they could eat on the actual menu  with so many restaurants in new orleans i wouldnt go back or recommend ithow this place gets so many stars i just dont know  devils food cake with cheap icing and chocolate shavings does not make a great cake  if you are in a pinch for a good cake go to the whole foods at 20th  callowhill and they can generally letter up a birthday cake for you with a quicknesssooo slow ive never seen anyone that works at this location do anything at a normal pace im not even asking for super speed just a reasonable pacethe worst customer service and nasty employees ever  slow servicemissing items and cashier not giving correct change  i felt like she wanted my 10  manager was no betternasty and said to call and complainshe did not care never againhad a grilled chicken sandwich on bun to go couldnt hold sandwich due to bottom bun being soggy  so i decided to just eat the meat  i saw a piece of hair as i removed the meat i havent ate there in years and will not eat there again  zero stars from mei had the most disappointing and appalling experiencing ordering catering from this specific chickfila location when i voiced my frustration with the manager on duty i was made to feel like my problem was of no concern or care to her and her team and she was unwilling to deescalate my frustrating situation she was much more interested in being right than doing what she could to help me as the customer of a large order i would not recommend ordering catering from this location unless you have the time and flexibility to take a chance on a tight schedule getting disrupted for the group you are feedingthe customer service was horrible i called to place an order for pick up the kids menu was not posted online so i asked the lady who answered for the kids menu she proceeded to tell me that she was too busy to tell me and placed me on hold however she didnt realize that i could still hear her she proceeded to complain that someone was on the phone asking her to read the entire menu and she didnt have time i told her to cancel the order and i drove up there when i got there and asked to speak to a manager i discovered that the person who answered the phone was the manager i have never experienced such rude and unprofessional customer service rude rude rudeyelp wants you to give stars but this place isnt worth it crap00000 stars for this pizza huti ordered online for delivery easy right nope they messed up the whole order and forgot the wings then i called the manger she barely listen offered no help at all just send me out my correct order and take this back nope never happened she sent the driver back out  to get the wrong order still no wing and then refused to refund she never brought the right order dont use your hard earned money herethey really need someone that cares about a jobill never order from this place again because if you complain she probably spits in your fooddont waste your time and moneygo to the pizza hut on judge perez they are the bestand to the manager karma a bitch just waitand fuck you bitchhave a nice daywe wanted to pick up some zima and a male employee was very nice and said they were sold out and zima is sold out everywhere in town so he helped us pick out something he said will be similar but turns out grocery stores and walmart have zima lies oh and ps mr man truly lime and midori tastes nothing like zima and midori so thanks for that toowalked in about 3pm five employees huddled around the bar  several looked at us no one spoke finally we walked out  called the manager and told him what happened he says well the bartender motioned to you all  really  no one spoke and it was like we intruded rude and unprofessional  by the way the manager could have cared lesswell my daughter and i figured wed try the new place on speedway before the one opens up on our side of town on valencia   let me say the burgers looked like whataburger but that is where it ends  i get the name now lotaburger must come from the bible as to lots wife because the burgers we had tasted like a pillar of salt  sorry wont be going to this place againthe service and bathroom was horrible the soap dispenser didnt work and the toilets were out of order zaxbys need to do better with who they are hiring and the cleanliness of the store the lady at the drive thru and the cooks did not have on a hair net the sweet tea was sour the ice machine took forever it seems like to dispense ice the chicken strips and fries were dry the person taking my order was not welcoming at all all the employees on the front line seem to be playing around rather then working a lot of lout talking coming from the back not a inviting environment at all i will not come back to this location and i suggest strongly that you think about it twice before coming to this locationi went here looking for a gift i read the good reviews and decided to check it out as i walked around i did not touch anything in the store until i got to a t shirt which i opened to look and and folded and put down i got remarks from the owner which i could barely understand and i told her i was just looking at it i then was looking at the cards and yes i did actually intend on buying one i picked one up and the owner said something which i did not understand and i stated excuse me and she said you do not understand my english i proceeded to look at another card to see what it said and the owner came over took the card from me and told me not to touch them and took every card in the row to inspect as if i damaged them i have never experienced that in my life where looking at a non breakable item like that was such a horrible deed not a way to get business hard to believe given so many excellent reviews but ill spend my money elsewhererude inattentive uneducated and they always make you feel that you are bothering them i have started using mobile order because its one less idiot to deal within the chain when they start making 15 an hour we will be ordering from kiosks and maybe dealing with one personhorrible customer service major attitude problem been to many starbucks in us and in other countries definitely do not follow the starbucks great customer service modelhorrible not only did i wait over and hour and 40 mins for delivery my order was wrong and apparently the use a cell phone as their business phone and every time i called to inform them my order was wrong the kept hitting the button to send the call to voicemail i will never order from there again and i cant see them staying in business for very long if thats how they run their businessplace is horrible they make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that its actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap on top of that the sandwich was assunhelpful unapologetic and not worth the hassle i will take my business elsewhere in the futureinspect your food before you put it in your mouth ordered the spicy tuna roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known  think projectile vomiting  the tuna was mushy and the color was too dark like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day this place needs to be inspected avoid this placetoosoft ice cream kids working dont pay attention to you and chat with each other bad ice cream i like dq but not this onefor a long time as a chinese foodie my family loved going to han dynasty  but we went there for my birthday last week and the food was horrible the string beans were fried in stale tasting oil and the boss wont admit it had a bad taste to it the walnut sprimp that we ordered were fried in extra thick batter the small sprimp turned into a fat corn dog looking thing our last dish orange beef was also covered in thick breading beef was not tender hard to chew and it had crazy amount of glaze glob on it horrible horriblei was super disappointed after wanting to visit there for a while dont waste your money this is not how chinese food should taste likei constantly go to coffee shops to study and i am obsessed with teas and latte art im a huge fan of savory cafe and i just tried coffee cat for the first time today ive been to french press countless times with friends and today completely changed my opinion ive been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks however i didnt feel like getting one the second i sat down one of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink our conversion did we get you a drink no i havent ordered one yet are you going to yes in do time thanks do i have to order one the second i get here its not like i look fucking homeless here with my mac and nice clothes actually baffled hahaha i wish i wasnt so pleasant when she spoke with me whats up with the fact that they dont have green tea matcha powder their coffee is good ill give them that but maybe they need to weave out some of the rude people who work here pitty im a loyal customerok im going to be debbie downer  awful coffee just awful  maybe thats not fair i have yet to sample all of their fare and perhaps its a bad idea to fit them into the mold that mugshots which was gone before i arrived in manayunk occupied but in the end they call themselves a cafe which translates into a coffee shop moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu so i feel comfortable in holding them to some standard  they were out of their banana bread all of it for all the flavors they described they didnt have a single one left when i arrived this is a significant portion of their menu and they were out of all of it which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock they had plenty of baklava but im allergic to two of the nuts they use in them so even experimenting is a horrible idea  there was a small child running around screaming and i could hear arguing breaking out as i stepped through the door with my coffee im not saying that without empathy but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of even if the food had been perfect it would have detracted from the experience  andthe coffeei have to  go back to that i really do if i has handed a mug of starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it and my only other option was what i had herei would seriously have to debate that decision this is a horrible thing to say its cruel and cruel honestly isnt that much more helpful than well meaning lies its even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day and determine that its still a correct assessment but this is someone who during his broke college days would drink coffee through day old grounds someone who used an abandoned french press that was held together with duct tape and i couldnt finish it seriously it was that bad i dont know how they did it and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself  maybe the owners are nice folk maybe their mediterranean food is really good as other reviews seem to indicate but they sure as shit aint a cafe if they want to be cheery and have great falafel they should do that but dear god in heaven who i have forsaken in so many ways they put something on the menu so bad i am still  shocked combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere i cant possibly give this place a good ratingthe worst food was cold and tasteless  we thought we were eating week old leftovers  when this place closes i hope the guys from zaynas will take it over so we can have a good place to go in this part of townthis restaurant was the worst experience that ive had in indianapolis to date a coworker and i decided to go to lunch today at a mexican restaurant that she recommend it it was my first mind to go somewhere else but i decided to try something new and yelp something different for a change mistake   upon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about hey 599 we sat down and the waitress seemed friendly she showed us the lunch menu i decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try im still seachung for great tamales of course like a few other places that i have been too lately my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today  interesting because its noon and you dont have my ready but you opened at 11am icant  i let it go and took off a star getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese it came out in due time  only to find out i was not very happy with the food at all actually took me a little while to eat my second taco the positive thing about the meal was the portions the two tacos were large it just did not taste like authentic mexican tacos it tastes like something that i could easily make at home american besttry kindof tacos another star gone   we ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do however she did not bring out separate checks in fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was the waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was well knowing that i only spent about 7 in the restaurant i did not think i needed to do the same mistake i was very surprised when found out my meal was almost 11 when my card was ran apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which i asked for instead never was told it was extra i knew i had to pay for extra chees but dang  management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill especially since i couldnt get itemized bill i was not happy not buying the explaination nor impressed they give me a small change of a refund and vowed to never be back   no tamales no detailed bill no prior knowledge of changes would be extra food not great at all yeah you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking never again epicepicepicfailover the summer i ordered from here without incident then comes fall and a particularly cold evening  we placed our order or tried at first my friend repeated the order three times  the repeated her card number 2 times  then became tired of repeating my address  i gave them my address the 4th time  we were told wed get our indian goodness in 30  45 minutes  not a problem  we were fine with waiting  we thought the repeatingourselvesthing was pretty comical until  over an hour later we had no indian goodness  we called the restaurant  we let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame  the person on the phone didnt seem to understand weve been waiting over an hour  can you tell us if the driver is near  several times  this time the repetition wasnt comical  then came irate guy on phone  do you want your food do you want your food why do i have to tell you where the driver is why  my friend and i looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while irate guy on phone kept screaming do you want your food etc    driver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place  my friend collected the food and paid the tab    the food mediocre  before to night i was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time  tonight a little late because of a lovely noreaster but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time i will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service  bad service made the mediocre food meh portions or naan and poori fail  yeeeeeaaahhh no will i order take out or delivery again from this establishment nope  in short tandoor india you bite and not the way i likeive been here a handful of times and bagels have always been delicious i visited the shop on 51918 and this will be my last visit i went there because i was hungry and in need of food but it seemed like i walked into the middle of classic pt barnum show clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs the first employee i interacted with at the bulk bagel counter didnt hesitate to let me know that i was attempting to order from the wrong location fair enough they did have a sign on the counter but it wasnt as conspicuous as an order here sign that dangles from the ceiling her tone made it clear to me that i had already committed one transgression i then order from the attendant at the pos i clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese three times the first clarification was that i wanted everything bagels not plain the second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese not garlic cream cheese the third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels at this point i had more confidence in a drunk esl uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request after waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust my name was called and the first employee i interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag on the ride home i asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably fed the order up he assured me that the quantity was correct when i got home i feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels like a joyous child on christmas day only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat the breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it i am so glad that i expected disappointment honestly im not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop red house bagels where the staff is courteous the shop is cleaner and the bagels a bit larger red house is my new bagel stop  sorry newtown bagel co youve been replaced although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations my words of advice replace dont clean your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience i would hate to see what your walkin and floors behind the counter look like coach your employees on courteous service or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the pos because sometimes those machines arent as navigable for some operators id like to keep going on about this but i am probably beating an already abused pt barnum animalthis place has the worst customer service my friend and i went to jack in the box at 1230am on a wednesday night we were the only ones there and i went to order my food and said okay so thats it for that order were gonna have a second order and he said we actually cant do two orders and i understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there so i said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru like what difference does it make and he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and i was wasnt going to do that so i told him i would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary so i got my food and went around again still no cars had been through the drive thru and ordered a single coke not even food which made it more annoying but anyways so we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we werent gonna complain because we were already over this experience so we were just gonna buy them and so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no she literally said uhmmmmmm no and i was speechless needless to say screw themheed the warnings long lines poor service horrible food im sorry but everything we were served was just nasty we had a 3 hour layover and i neglected to look at the reviews prior to us getting a table  we passed by several tables on our way to our seats and everyones food looked straight nasty but we stuck it out and went on and ordered anyway we started with some cheese sticks these were so gross when they arrived on our table they were soaked with some kind of weird brown juice i assume it was the oil they were fried in that looked like it was last changed prior to the exxonvaldez oil spill back in 89 horrible burnt greasy and very off flavor our table mate next to us ordered the ravioli bites they were also covered in the brown oil grease and they didnt even eat 12 of them  our pasta dishes were equally as disappointing and gross i opted for the lasagna and it was nasty the pasta itself was overcooked which i can live with if bolstered by a decent sauce qualityfresh meat and good cheese this lasagna offered none of these things the sauce was the worst offender packed with sugar it was a very sweet very thin redmarinara sauce there were no spices or typical italian seasonings no garlic no onion flavor none of the deep rich flavors that typically adorn good italianstyle food the cheese was cheap and rubbery and there was no meat in the lasagna to speak of literally i had none in my dish it was absent and sorely needed  do not eat here you will regret itnever get takeout from this place ever unless you want to eat your lunch at dinner time  not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grillhe called back because of credit card issues  i will never get anything from this place againterrible service went at 1pm on a saturday and waited 25 minutes for my order there were 2 ppl ahead of me with normal single sandwich orders first the guy didnt know how to make my sandwich a black forest ham and skipped to the next guy in line until he could get the girl in the back to come make it leaving me just standing there getting passed over in line he then put the condiments on and put on an insane amount of mustard i didnt ask for extra i just said mustard thinking hed run it back and forth 2 or 3 times and thats it nope he squeezed the crap out of the bottle and completely drenched it then he cant work the cash register only the girl can just one thing after another    i then go out front to eat and hear a car at the drive thru placing an order on the touch screen kiosk which is actually a really good idea but the girl inside is telling them over the mic they have to come inside to order that they cant place there order in the drive thru employees at this location seriously need some training or help go to another location if you canabysmal customer service came in on wednesday at 6ish not busy ordered a meatball sub from some short white dude he insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when i challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly as my sub was in the oven i decided to look up subways website and lo and behold meatball subs do get four meatballs just like every other time i have gotten a sub from that store when i informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich and snippily finished the order even after i informed him i didnt want to cause any trouble  there are some wonderful people who work at this subway that guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely im not expecting five star service from a subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it maybe you arent meant for a job that involves customer interaction will not be returning to this store ever againmy girlfriend and i decided to try kalamatas last night at around 730 the guy at the counter asked us if were ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly not once but multiple times   we ordered 2 lamb gyros a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh the potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best either they were premade and microwaved to order or were just sitting on a hot plate not something id expect from any restaurant   the tabouleh was sour  like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour we decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was this is our recipe this is the way we make it its fine if you dont like it but this is how we make it i agree i have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like or how to make it but i have tasted good tabouleh in the past and this was far from it i pity the people whove eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because theyre really missing out   the gyros were pedestrian at best underseasoned and most of all undersauced the veggies were on one side of the pita the meat on the other  so youd never get a mouthful of veggiesmeat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce suspecting another this is how we sauce our gyros this is our recipe moment we decided to finish our food asap  finally the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while were still eating really ive no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp but there are way better restaurants in nashville for mediterranean foodthis mcdonalds has poor management went there once and they informed us they were out of straws another time the shake machine for st pattys shakes was down and they didnt know when it would be up went there 2 weeks later and it was still down went there once for take home and when we got home there was no hamburger in the buns just a bun with pickles tomatoes and lettuce finally i got the message that these people did not care about their customers and stop going thereshort and sweet  been here three times and havent been impressed this last time i called in an order the guy taking my order was rude and not helpful i dont know the menu and asked him some questions and he knew about as much as i did when arriving to pick up had to look for service was surprised by the 27 bill for one entree got home missing salad over cooked steak over cooked fries never again hope not everyone has that experience good luck   ps bring your cash cow this place is pricy especially for the quality of foodmy family and i love chipotle   we choose this chain most often when considering fast food   this particular location was terrible   we ordered ahead and first of all the order was wrong   and may i ask how does a mexican restaurant run out of guacamole   and run out of taco shells  and run out of the pepper and onion stir fry mix   also the service was very slow   the food was thrown together and not in the usual way    my son called to tell them about the order when he got home and the person on the phone didnt care   i have nothing good to say about this dining experienceawful  long wait times slow service out of ingredients and orders filled sloppily and incorrectly go down the street to the one on york road near the mallgood bagels but they can never get an order right  we live in nj so when you ask for taylor ham and cheese you think they would be able to handle this    instead i get a ham and cheese sandwich or an egg ham and cheese sandwich  i am done with this place  city market or lumberville general store will be my two choices from here on outi used to think this place was amazing during office hours the place is fantastic but grabbing food during a night out dont even do it  all the workers assume every patron who comes at night is a drunk so asking simple questions is automatically a reason to yell and refuse service customer service is absolutely horrible i will never go here again there patties have shrunk and price has remained the same this place has definitely taken a dive from what it used to bei have been to this location once before with no issues last time i got my soon a bubble tea the pearls tapicoa bubbles seemed to make him sick i hope this place does a better job at assuring the drinksfood is freshwow this was proof that texans cant bbq it was at best a warm attempt at southern bbq meat only had a slight smokey flavour pulled pork was dry  the slaw had zero dressing the bean i spit out sweet garlic unpleasant tastethe potato salad the dressing was good  the side ribs were whacked off and tossed on top of everything  did i bother the owner by going in to buy food about as personable as getting bunched in the facelast when a person comes into your bbq joint no take home sauce i give fired up a d  needs major improvements and to the pony tail goof go buy a personality  there was only one bbq king and he passed away four yrsago smokey joe would have told ya take your ass back to texasabout 2 months ago i ordered a sandwich and a side of coleslaw for lunch while at work it took about 45 minutes for delivery less than a mile away no big deal i absolutely can not stand toasted i specifically told them not toasted and no middle slice of bread when my order arrived the coleslaw was missing the middle piece of bread was in it not big deal i can take that out the big deal was it was toasted i called and they offered to give me a free sandwich on a future order today i placed my order at 1208 i called at 107 to find out where my lunch was the lady told me it was made and sitting there what the hell you leave a sandwich sitting there for an hour apparently they only have two drivers on today i guess since it was a free order the driver did not think he was getting tipped so i became low priority here it is 123 and still no foodi absolutely love jimmy johns i will never come back to this one  they screwed up my ordered and their first response was sorry we cant take the sandwich back after its served thats a health code violation   too many places that care about my business for that crapi just called to place a delivery order and they stated they could not do it i have to come into the store if i wanted to get food from them whatwe received a coupon for a buy onegetone so we decided to try this place we go to qdoba all the time so i thought this would be a similar experience   service all of the staff we interacted with while placing our food order were very polite and upbeat we took our food to go as we live a two minute drive away   food i ordered a chicken burrito bowl and my husband ordered a steak burrito with fajita veggies i was eating in the home office and bit into quite a few cold chicken pieces i ate around the chicken as i have an unnatural fear of food poisoning we live very close to the restaurant so either the container the chopped chicken in was cold or the meat was not cooked all the way i went to go check on my husband in the living room and he stopped eating all together half way through his burrito he found a 4 or so inch long brown hair yay for finding hair in your food i asked him if he wanted me to call the restaurant and he said no he just tossed his food as did i   four hours later and my stomach is still not agreeing with me so go to chipotle with caution at least the staff was nicei first want to start off with the fact of how much i love blaze pizza ive been here mmmmm about ten times well not this exact location but nevertheless to blaze pizza tonights occasion was friday pizza night with the kids what made it even more fantastic was the buy one get one free coupon i retrieved from facebook i ended up seeing a friend here who also had the coupon before i ordered our food i made sure to ask the cashier amanda if it was buy one get one free for all pizzas or per order she stated for all pizzas i went ahead and ordered and added my friends order to ours just to be nice once it was time to check out the same cashier then said no you can only have one per order i purposely ordered four pizzas based one what she told me i was of course puzzled and frustrated she then turned to who she called the general manager and said i can only do one right and he said yes without even looking into what was going on i tried to get his attention but he ignored me he was a little busy i will add but when something is happening tend to it i told her maam i only did it this way because of what you told me but of course she acted oblivious totally upset me but i decided to just leave with the bill we were given i was really upset not because of what happened but because of how it was handled rudely and unprofessionalthe waiter we had made this the absolute worst dining experience ive ever had as my party and i were ordering our waiter would not stop rushing us the wait for our food was far too long considering that it was 11 pm and there was hardly anybody there when the food finally arrived this guy just tossed our food on the table instead of carefully setting the hot plates down also a few dishes were not served the way we requested mainly because we were rushed and the waiter probably had not written everything we said down im a good person so i had to tip the guy but i really wanted to walk out with just paying whatever my bill was will not be returning herethis place has good food however the customer service is terrible i arrived at around 730 pm on a thursday and i wanted to order a take out appetizer or meal first i asked them what was the meal of the day a waitress told me that they dont have any left ok that was understandable then i asked the same waitress if i can order meat pies arayes she said that this will take 40 minutes to make it ready she pointed to a group of people sitting of about 25 persons and implied that they were busy making food for them afterwards i asked her what about just a regular appetizer like hummus and baba gannoush she again said that they need 40 minutes to prepare it also she pointed at the same group of people with her finger  at that point i just left the restaurant  it is horrendous that they needed 40 minutes to prepare hummus it is very obvious that they were overwhelmed and didnt want to waste their time on a small order very unprofessional and very unwelcoming very bad serviceplease do not go to this place the food is just horrible i thought of giving this place a second chance and i was disappointed again not that sitar and new delhi are great but they are much much better than tandoor please do not torture your taste buds by going to this placevisited on 121614 we have tried this restaurant location under various management  so when we saw it was open once again under a new name we wanted to give it a chance  we will not be going back  we did get carry out so we gave some slack on the mushy greasy onion rings and the texas toast  but my husband ordered the brisket and rib platter and i ordered the 12 chicken  the ribs were just ok the brisket was an end piece and was burned and inedible  the chicken was more the size of a cornish game hen and had little meat  they gave 2 small containers of bbq sauce which was not enough  we both asked for cole slaw but got potato salad  the cowboy beans were watery    it is one of the closest restaurants to us so we wanted it to be good but we will not be returningextremely slow service 20 mins in an empty drive thru and first time around they missed a full half of my order i come back and theyre less than apologetic and proceed to give me 90 of my order what does it take for a girl to get what she pays for around here not coming to this location again just horribleextremely rude staff including management i had ordered carry out only to return home with the wrong order my family has dietary restrictions so we could not eat what we had brought home so i went back to pick up the correct order when i got there i told the manager at the front that we had the wrong order they said they had my order and knew it was wrong so i asked why they didnt feel the need to notify my or anything that we had the wrong order the manager began to blame the employees no apology nothing dont let the renovations fool you there was no sense of professionalism or quality customer service i will not be returning to this locationwe dont eat at kfc very often i had the lame idea of trying it again first off the cashier michelle had a serious attitude problem rude as the day is long no smile no hello no thank you looked like she really hated her job we told her our food was dinein it was put in a to go bag no plates butter sporks etc i didnt dare ask for plates chicken was undercooked slaw and potatoes were ok biscuits fair are we going back nope bad attitudes dont fare well with meit always has a strong smell when you open the door plus they arent friendly or approachable at all i will never go in there againthis mcdonalds is as terrible as they come they have no care mess up every order take at least 10mins to answer you in drive thru at slow points in the day stay away smdhjust left therehorrible service and miserable employees  will never go there again miss baja freshtotal wine  more is much much better i dont this this bevmo location will be open much longer there are probably a maximum of 2 employees working here at any given time most of of their inventory is out of date and overpriced by a wide margin  no wonder this place is so emptywell the food is good love the spicy mayo the employee are nice but the owner wes is horrible i came in last week to order tempura chicken they changed there menu so she said get a child one for 7 i was fine with that it came with a lot of stuff which i dont eat i just eat the tempura so they gave me just chicken on a plate it used to be 399 for tempura and you got 4 pieces now its different so i received my food this jacka wes comes in and saw my meal which like i said was only chicken and tells the waitress charge her 12 dollars for it huh so i feel this is so unprofessional and rude last time i step foot in there they told me one price and im charged a different im very upset he needs to practice better owner relations cause it sucks last time for me and the chicken was over cooked smhliterally the most racist restaurant i have ever been into in my life the manager was as unprofessional as the teenagers running the register i literally waited for 5 minutes to be called to a register for my order with no one else on any lines not sure if it was my skin tone but wow i had another experience that made my suspicions facts after paying a second order and being passed over by 3 other customers who ordered after me i only ordered a kids nuggets terrible everythingordered the small plate tortellini it wasnt cooked and had a long brown hair mixed into the marinara sauce i went back to return the food and was the gentleman behind the countered became argumentative and defensive  he then begrudgingly gave me a refund and offered no other solution  too add to the already terrible experience he sarcastically wished a nice daywasnt impressed by the crazy long lines and only 1 person working took absolutely forever and was definitely not worth it the food was terrible and so was the coffee definitely wouldnt recommend this place to anyonethe donair meat was very cheap tastinglike it came out of a can or something gross   the place looks run down  we wont be back  people who think this is the best donair have lived a very sheltered life in the land of donairs  this is probably one of my worst onesthey charge 2 more for tomato mozzarella sandwich then the regular standalone starbucks doi will literally never eat here because the ownerparking lot bouncer was very rude when we went to dinner on saint patricks day ar tir a nog we tried to park in open parking that was sectioned off by short hills restaurant and deli of cherry hill nj  orange cones and signs which by the way are completely illegal and they were not respectful nice or friendly about us accidentally parking there they were simply jealous of the prosperous irish pub the manparking lot bouncer not sure of his name was completely rude even though they closed at 9 he would not let us park there as of 815 we are new residents to this area and looking for new local places to enjoy but we will not ever be enjoying this place short hills restaurant and deli since the owneror parking lot bouncer was so rude we will never fraternize a business who stands for being rude to their neighbors and especially to their fellow business owners who pay for the parking spots just as much as they do short hills restaurant and deli  im extremely disappointed in youre neighborhood hospitality and how you treat youre neighborsmuy mal servicio y me robaron ordene un pastel para 30 personas y me dieron uno para 10 personas y muy mal sabor y mal decorado tenga cuidado con sus ordenesthis starbucks is struggling  understaffed and undertrained  avoid until they get it togetherdo not go here ever again ive been ordering here for seven years and tonight i ordered the usual for the family and it was horrible  they couldnt even get the burger right we ordered four combos three with onion rings rings and one with fries they put the one onion ring on the burger and they gave us all fries and screwed up the donairs we called and complained about the order and they said we will remake it free of charge  but they still screwed it up  the doanirs came with lettuce and a dusting of donair meat we asked for extra sweet sauce and we still had to look for any sauce at all  the place is under new ownership and clearly they do not know what they are doing  they couldnt even get the pop order correctly  it was painfulwe went on a wenesday 6618  920pm  for endless wings everything was normal then we found a folded up receipt in our coke under the ice i already took two sips into it i was so shocked that they missed this unexceptionable i cant imagine where it came from the only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink do hooters re use their cups without washing it or tossing whatever was in it i brought this up to our server savannah and she played it off stated wow that never happens its usually bugs or something in it i dont know what type of explanation or apology that was if i eat at a restaurant i am expecting clean and delicious food with service i did not get it at this hootersnever coming back this is the second weve given then tonight they charged us an extra 5 but was easily correct not a huge deal second the onion rings tasted like vanilla we ordered a brownie cookie dough blast and got a cookie dough shake instead the difference of about a dollar my shake was missing the middle portionsee photo the only good thing about this trip was the mozzarella sticks 2 shakes and 2 sides for 15 no thankswasnt referring to sandwiches  was referring to gyro play with  beef rice lettuce and pita bread im a big fan of the food here but recently noticed that they dont do a great job of washing their beer glasses here when you see the bubbles sticking to the inside of the glass thats when you know somethings up other than that id probably give the place four starsyesterday our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in montecito the dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldnt be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return the food was decent but the service earned our server a 2 tipi last reviewed this place three years ago when the host at ru sans refused to seat my family with small child on a not very busy early evening  i actually avoided the place for some time and had long wasabi laced affairs with places like fujiyama in west nashville    i recently returned for a late nite bite with a boy and it was significantly mediocre to warrant an update  like my crumbling relationship rusans chokes itself on sad attempts to dress up what was always low quality  the washed out party techno and poor lighting is like being in the expositional scene of a romantic comedy set in new york but not in the good way the bloated menu is utterly ridiculous and stopped impressing people in 2004 the sushi like our attempt to still enjoy sharing a meal together was just pathetic 90 rice soggy seaweed and overloaded with a sweet sauce  im breaking up with you again rusans i wish you the best but im afraid that the gulch is a big sea and there are plenty of other fishco worker and i visited the location near providence rd in brandon on today normally our experience has always been good today it was just terrible i order the 599 special but did not want the rice so i ask the cashier could i have  a bed of greens he said no then i said give me a green salad which he was going to charge me the same price as a ceasar salad i then said if you going to charge me for a ceasars salad just give me the salad when i got the saladit look like they took 2 leaf of lettuce and drown it in dressing very pissedthen my coworker ordered her food again she also wanted to substitute  the rice why is that so hard  my point being terrible service  needless to say we was not happy and want be going backordered 4 pot pies she said they have them made then manager takes one and says i have to wait 20 minutes for another one and i should order something else every time i come here theres a problem go somewhere else  how is a 20 minute menu item that is all over tv even a fast food itemi have now been waiting in line for 30 minutes for my order to be processed unreal  poor management or lack thereofwe came here for the first time on a slow sunday morning but didnt even get to eat we came for breakfast and waited in line to order for a few minutes the people in front of us ordered breakfast next when it was our turn the girl at the counter informed us they do not serve breakfast after 1030 we looked at the time and it was 1030 on the nose since breakfast was what we came for we left it doesnt seem like they should have had to be so steadfast about their cutoff time if it was 1035 i would understand it or if we werent already waiting in line before 1030 i dont think we will be back because this experience left a sour taste in our mouthsif i could give this subway 0 stars i would the only reason im not overcome with guilt of misleading people with the extra star is because once in a while once you suffer through the ordering experience the food is somewhat tasty sometimes   i am surprised to see more reviewers didnt comment specifically on the chain smoking smug openly mocking rude sandwich maker that seems to always be the only employee a few did but not all   this man completely ruins the subway experience he laughs at you the whole time you order moves so slow doesnt respond when spoken to and gives the most disturbing looks i do not understand how he keeps his job unless hes also the owner and in that case i dont understand how he runs the business  go to the wawa up the street if you need a fresh hoagieonce again as of friday it seems as though wholefoods is moving away from organic and non gmo labeled products  this transition is moving sooo slow wholefoods market share will no doubt decline  also they always out of stock of store brand organic chicken breastsat in the drive thru for 15 minutes finally got to order and the employee couldnt get our order right he then has the nerve to yell at me through the speaker and tell me im busy doing 6 things at once hold on i have never felt so disrespected at a fast food joint i immediately leave the drive thru to go in and let the manager on duty know how rude his employee was and so we could finally order our food let me remind you by this point we had been here 20 minutes and still havent even ordered i talked with the manager order our food and it still took another 20 minutes to get it i work in a restaurant i know that it isnt as easy as people think they werent understaffed they werent busy and that is why i am appalled at the lack of customer service and execution 45 minutes for food and terrible customer service will not be coming backhorrible in everyway coffee and food taste horrible horrible service too hat trick of horrible no starsdo not order the burgers the menu laughingly states that they have the best burgers in town not even close burger king has more flavor than these clearly frozen stale tasting poorly cooked pucks also you could tell that the appetizers while properly hot were food service grade precooked frozen concoctions that they then reheated i cannot speak to other menu items but im not going to waste any more money here there is no excuse for not serving fresh foodi used to really really like going to this hardees i liked hardees breakfast menu a lot  i even came here and spent close to 30 on breakfast items for st patricks day  all of that came crashing down one saturday afternoon when the window checker never gave my debit card back to me as i was distracted in my vehicle and bought 140 worth of gas  thankfully my bank was able to stop any further transactions before they started buying flat screens at best buy i wont risk using the drive thru here againi am writing this based on the concertbar only  we went to the eddie money concert and chose the general admission tickets  the vip seats appeared to be very well placed for viewing  unless you arrive at least an hour early and wait at the rail constantly or you are well over 6 ft you will have a hard time seeing anything  the stage is raised above the vip crowd nicely but appears to be level with the ga crowd  this leaves over 90 of the general admission patron with a very limited view  i am 5 11 and could see the band from the neck up about 60 of the time  i would guess that men under 5 10 and almost every woman not in the front spent most of the show watching on a screen to the side that had the resolution of a pizza parlor the wait staff was understaffed and less than efficient  the security staff was just down right rude  the sound was nice  eddie money was great  but in the nonvip area the concert layout and the service left much to be desired it might not be fair that a concert rating affects the restaurant rating but if you choose to have concerts in your restaurantcame in at 959 am when they open at 10 am door was unlocked and everything but they lady was very rude and told us they werent open walked out a couple steps turned around and she had flicked the open sign on decided not to walk back because of the poor customer servicei been to a lot of places but this place was gross i am sorry to say but there was hair in my good and the waitress was rude25 sep 2018  we went in and found the establishment was worn it was difficult to read the menu the menu did not say one could purchase an individual piece of chicken the lady behind the counter was as slow as molasses in the wintertime  when we finely stepped up to the counter the employee was unable to address my questions about the menu her speech was inaudible  i asked if she spoke english im pretty sure she did but not very well my wife and i walked out without ordering  we will not be backdefinitely not what it used to be when it was christines twisty treat theres sofas outside and its an eyesore i also went there before for a strawberry banana smoothie and the girl working said she didnt know how to make it bc she wasnt trained0 stars for customer service would be appropriate the disaster they created for my daughters confirmation cannot be put in words everybody is entitled to make mistakes even big ones its how they handle them  allow me to describe the situation it all started when we receive the box minutes before our luncheon with somebody elses name on it the cake didnt fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box  when we open the box it had our daughters name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader none of the requested decorations including the holy cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake the top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme the cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and im unsure why we counted over 40 of them making it impossible to cut we attempted to call master baker several times and they were not open finally 2 weeks after the event were able to get ahold to somebody who could actually care less said thank you for the learning experience we will discuss it are a next meeting thats it no desire to disgusted details and all they did was criticize us for waiting so long to get back to them when in fact they were never open when we called we had photograph evidence of what they provided us still unwilling to listen  well chad i cant believe you would treat customers like we were treatedmazarros is fabulous of course on my visit yesterday i was very disappointed they refused to sell me meat cut for braciole the man at the meat counter said they only order this meat to make their own braciole to sell since they sell so many ingredients for customers to make their own italian recipes at home this seems very odd fortunately fresh market was happy to help me outare you kidding me ive been sitting in their drive thru a total of 20 minutes why have i never learned my lesson about this dd i do not know but after today i will never be back again people have to go to work dont have time to be sitting in a drive thru for 1520 minsthis review is strictly based on leslie  an employee at the goleta store  she has been very rude on two separate visits to the store  we entered this evening and i was so insulted by her behavior i left without ordering the cake for my sons birthday  we love the cakes and come in pretty often  i will not come in any more if leslie is workingcant believe this pit stays open like walking into a fellini set disgusting dirtyusually i love 4 rivers the location in west tampa  today was just horrible   i was overcharged for my meal with no explanation to set it right  i had the burnt ends sandwich which was nothing but fat  couldnt even finish my meal for 1763 which is what i was charged for a sandwich with two sides at lunch i expect a bit more  will not be back to this locationthe atmosphere was good however i didnt like the music so loud  if you are looking for japanese ramen noodle dont ever order  its taste horrible if you cook instant ramen is better   i was waiting for my check for10min our server didnt come to our table  i wont go there againi want to start off with the fact that ive been here multiple times the first time everything was great it was around lunch the service was fantastic the food was fantastic and i decided to make it my go to diner the second time i brought my mother and she ordered a cheese quesadilla when it came out it was just slices of cheese ontop of a folded tortilla we spoke to the manager about it who told us we were wrong about wanting to order something different so today i decided to give this place one last chance came in with my boyfriend and kids we ordered two reubens one pastrami one corn beef and we split them as we always have the kids ordered typical kids meals when our food came out the rye was completely under toasted and the fries were not well done as a server myself i know that the cooks dont always listen to what the ticket said one of the kids meals was completely over cooked and the other was under cooked roasted turkey under cooked chicken fingers over cooked the managerhost came up to the stand which was directly behind us and started coughing very loudly i turned around to make sure he was ok and hes facing my table and coughing without covering his mouth at that point i had enough i politely asked our waitress for a box  the check when i went up to pay the same managerhost was there to cash me out didnt even ask how everything was just grabbed the money out of my hand the entire time i was there the managerhost was yelling at the busser about cleaning tables from what i saw the busser moved very quickly and there was only one busser from what i saw so yelling at him was uncalled for especially in front of guests he also yelled across the restaurant several times for ashley to come get a beer for another server instead of just walking his lazy a the 5 feet to the table it needed to go to and last but not least the manager gave me and the kids a dirty look and scoffed when one of the children asked if he could go give our server her tip which is completely uncalled for and unprofessional i told him yes but he needed to wait until she was done at the table which he did he then waited for her by our table and handed her the tip and smiled she was very polite to all 4 of us and addressed any and all concerns we had id suggest my server find a job elsewhere she was absolutely fantastic and the only reason im even giving 1 star i will never be back unless the management changes i have been a server for over 10 years now so i know what is expected out of servers bussers  management and this manager was by far one of the worst ive ever seen in any restaurant so to the lovely server with the bandana headband get out while you still can youre a great server and plenty of restaurants would be lucky to have you as a part of their companyall i have to say is that epcots mexico had better tacos than this authentic mexican joint  and thats pretty disappointing  the meat was mildly warm and wasnt seasoned well enough the beans and rice were bland as well they were out of steak so we mistakenly tried pork skin imagine eating diced slugs stuffed in a soft tortilla that keeps falling apart now pretend that moment in time never happened and you didnt waste your money on something that traumatizing  yeahnot as easy as youd think  i was really looking forward to the holeinthewall authenticity but i was sorely lead astray by previous reviews of this place  just dont do itwhy did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee  because there wasnt any coffee made in a coffee establishment thats why in addition there are noncustomers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky im done with this cosi ill be going to brew ha ha from now on the customer service is just too poor herereally need to get some outlets i understand that you dont want people sitting there too long but its really inconvenient when you need to do work on the computer and theres no option to charge your computer  honestly is the reason i stopped going there  also really need to get some shades to pull down on the windows in the afternoon the sun blinds you in most of the indoor searing unless youre against the walli would have rather put a hundred dollars down the toilet terrible food prices and service  this place is a joke i emailed them many times to let them know how our experience was only to have our emails returned undeliverable again and again i own a business and i would have wanted to know how it was being run employees not giving a hoot about the place its food or the most importantits customers its a shame shame on themthis is one of the worst venues ive been too and definitely wont be coming back i came here over the weekend to see primus and i was so disappointed in both the layout of the place and the people that worked there first the security at the door was confused they took our tickets and then walked back in the place leaving us outside when he finally decided to return he actually asked us for our tickets even though he took them with him after rummaging through his pocketstada he found them and finally let us in  we were escorted upstairs to the bar  restaurant where we were told they were out of food menus and they would give us one when it came availableso thats when the waiting game began we waited about 10 minutes for a menu and then it took about 15 minutes for someone to circle back around and take our order after placing our order it took them over 30 minutes to make one chicken caesar wrap once we finally got our food they proceed to kick us out because they needed to get the top floor ready for the show  so frustrating the night continued to go just as frustrating the layout of this place is rectangular and very long so if you dont get there early and man your spot good looking getting a glimpse at the stage they cram over 1000 people in this small club and if it wasnt for the tv screens people would have missed the show entirely i feel horrible for about 70 of the people that came to watch the show there is really no good seat in the house also their security is absolutely horrible they were constantly rushing through the crowds to stop people from smoking or taking pictures when they werent shoving you to get through they were shining a flashlight in your eyes we also had security shove us out of the way so he could stand in front of us and take video himself of the band that was playing they are so unprofessional and rude if you plan on going to see a show here i wouldnt recommend it especially if theres going to be a lot of people and a soldout show because chances are you wont see anything and im serious when i say it that only about 30 of the ticket holders could see anything the rest of us were just standing around watching the tv screens this place is super lame and i wont ever be backif i could give this establishment less than one star i would over two hours for an appetizer at the bar 2 12 hours for 4 out of 6 people to get the food they ordered for lunch brutal  oh and the bathroom was disgusting i appreciate if your employees dont show up so half of the menu is off the table immediately but tell your customers if you cant deliver any food  and the owner did nothing to make it right in the end  other than to give a halfassed apology  not impressedhorrible customer service the employees here seem to hate life cause they dont smile and have a very nonchalant attitude to every customer in the line one of the employees smelt like weed and looked like he just got done smoking a bong another employee was very rude when she asked a customer not stick her hands over the glass when the customer was only trying to point out what she wanted the employee didnt need to respond to the customer in such a rude manner i just moved here to brentwood and im very disappointed in this establishment and the employees here   these employees either need to be retrained and taught how to smile and or just need to be replaced with humans who actually love life and dont take their job for grantedclose this place poor showing for the arbys chain nobody runs out of roast beef most of the employees have attitudes from what i have observed been here 3 times and nothing changes save your lease moneythere were two people in front of me a young woman was working alone that night i watched her take the other two peoples orders and make their crepes from a pile of already made crepes on the counter and not prepare them fresh as they are supposed to she took my order and i asked for a fresh crepe made to order she ignored me and made my crepe from her pile of previously made crepes and i could see that she still had at least three more premade crepes yet to use my crepe was soggy and a little gross i watched her from the moment i stood in line till i left and she did not make one crepe for the three of us  the next day i was at the mall to deposit a cheque so i went to the crepe works to let them know what happened the night before and get another one to take home when i started to tell the guy what happened he cut me off and said i was wrong he told me it was impossible and i did not see that so i tell him that i know what i saw and it happened for three crepes not just mine again he tells me no im wrong they are not allowed to do that and so it was impossible i told him that he was calling me a liar which is a bad thing to do to a customer and that i was there and he was not so i would know what happened i tried logic as well explaining that the word impossible implies that there is no possible way for her to have done however anyone could make a bunch of crepes and pile them on top of each other its not even hard and in fact obviously she did it to cut corners and save time for herself   for the next twenty mins he tells me that i have no idea what i am talking about that its impossible to happen and that im wrong he also has the audacity to say im just in a bad mood so im saying these things because of that first of all this guy knows nothing about me and i was in a great mood before when i started to tell him about it i just wanted them to make sure it doesnt happen again now every time i come to get a crepe he asks me if im in a bad mood or not which makes me feel very uncomfortable plus when i told him that his customer service was horrible and no one talks to a customer that way that wants to run a successful business he tells me the owner would treat me exactly the same way he gave me a card supposedly with his bosses number on it but after i left a message explaining the whole thing i never heard back that was over two weeks ago now  i do mostly enjoy the crepes although they are never made the way the example looks it bothers me that every time i go buy one he asks me if im in a bad mood and makes fun of mesmall portions high prices      the food here is overpriced for the small amount of food they give  in the seafood combo they advertise as if it is a generous amount of food and when it comes they give you 4 shrimp  how cheap and ridiculous  the poboy is more bread than shrimp if they want to charge high they need to give you more food  avoid this place  it will just piss you offrude staff food was subpar and greasy i got a breakfast sandwich and it was greasy and soggy coffee was terrible and the espresso machine was out of serviceim here right now listening to pretty offensive rap  ugly btches hoes f bombs  very disappointing  im open minded and listen to all sorts of stuff but this is pretty out of controli was at the airport on tuesday evening and ordered 4 smoothies and was ready to pull out my debit card and the young man that was working behind the counter told me that i would get a discount if i paid cash i am always a bit leary about pulling out my debit card out in a place like the airport  not so much as to get a discount but to not use my card in such a public place i gave him 30 dollars he then hit cancel on the register and put the money in his pocket okthats stealing plain and simple the owner of that particular franchise needs to monitor the employees because eventually that type of behavior is paid for by the consumer i would have called that young man out at that moment but i was not positive of what i saw and when i asked my family if they noticed anything my daughter noticed the same thing  there could be a viable excuse for this but it did not look good for the young man or the other young man that was there working because he started to laugh out loud as we left saying something to the effect of   that was awesome as a business owner i would like to know if an employee is stealingso im letting you knowdo what you willthe date that this happened was 8415i made an order for a pizza that was never delivered called multiple times to which i was told my pizza was on its way i waited another 40 minutes and called back this time the man on the phone claimed to have knocked on the door and called i have proof that this step was never taken i waited in total for an hour and 30 minutes just to be lied to i will never be a customer againmy sister my great niece were at the village and thought wed give cinnaholics a try i sure am glad we bought the mini cinnamon rolls but wish we hadnt bought any the bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry either cooked too long or stale there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didnt taste like there was any cream cheese in it  maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut my sister got maple flavored which she did not like  the 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it  to say the least we scraped off all the toppings and still didnt eat all of the rolls perhaps this was a fluke but i seriously doubt we will come back to find out sorry  i dont like writing bad reviewsway over priced  burgers are very dry and tough ive never been to a starbucks  have had to go inside  wait at least 4 minutes for a knife because they forgot to put one in my bagel bag ive also never been to a starbucks where they dont hand a single napkinmy experience at dinardos was not a good one  my husband had a groupon and we went with another couple for a nice night out  when i walked in the place was dated and dingy  my husband called ahead of time to make reservations and to order jumbo or large crabs whichever they had that night  he was told he could get 3 jumbos and 5 large which was fine  when they came out they were so small   the 3 jumbo were in garlic and it was too overpowering  the old bay large crabs were dry inside  the hostess tried to share her knowledge on how all crabs are 1 and they are weighed and thats how they determine large and jumbo crabs  we just laughed and listened  she had no idea about crabs  we all crabbed and ate crabs since we were little children  grew up with them and know the difference  my friend and i got the jumbo lump crab cake with mushy broccoli  the cake was ok but it wasnt worth the price  in all it was a lousy dinner and when the bill came we were lost for words  small crabs a crab nacho appetizer that i believe they just waved the crab over it since there were a few pieces here and there and crab cakes that were lukewarm  it was a hugely disappointing dinner experience however the company was good and we made the best of it  save your money and pass on this poor excuse for a seafood restaurantthis location is suffering and will undoubtedly come on the radar for improvement not only was customer service the furthest thing from any employees mind the food was terrible we attempted to go through the drivethru sat there forever with no greeting or any sign of life from the speaker the screen was blank thought maybe it was broken so we drove around a few cars in front of us but no one moving so i went inside to order togo 2 people ahead of me 56 minutes later someone came to take the 1st guys order but couldnt use the register 2nd guy was in line for a refuns because he was double charged for an incorrect order i ordered 4 sandwiches not a single one had the correct toppings burgers cold fish sandwich over cooked fries were cold and gross we didnt even eat half our meal and threw it away i would give negative stars if i couldi thought this was a great addition to downtown st pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that i am a cook however the owners are gay hating bigots this isnt a review on the shop or the product but a review to let the lgbt community to stay away i have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop the only reason i returned was to make sure my feeling was right the male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me its as if he fears hell catch some disease by talking to a homosexual furthermore i have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though i am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice the one time his wife was around she intentionally and randomly i might add brought up a conversation about chickfila and mitt romney again this isnt a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the tampa bay community  for those wanting to support an antihateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit the fresh market rollin oats or earth organicsover priced drinks mixing 4 or 5 different liquors and adding juice should not cost 1500 and its not top shelf liquor either  2 crab clusters and 2 pieces of corn should not cost 2500 its a shame since i live right up the street i keep trying to give this place a chance but every time i leave disappointed im not even going to speak on the horrible parking this place sucks ass i would shut this location down every drive threw order is 5 min or longer who manages this place im done trying to eat therei came here once  never again the girls working know nothing about the food  basically shove a menu in your hand i wasnt impressed with the food myself it was very bland  pricey for 1 mealomg i cant believe that how these guys will ruined your food very nasty service asked something got something always out for lemon they dont care about customer that all i can say staff talking loudlymaking unnecessary noise wont go back for sure  kop chipotle is the best one to visittonight i was really disappointed i called and placed a take out our about 451hr prior to closing i ordered a chicken fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip the only thing right was the chips and dip if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not i should have taking pics of this mess i was given but i was to upset once i drove all the way home only to realize my order was wrong and missing had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas you could barley see any cheese i called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill no dinner than i hung up and opened the burrito i noticed i had no fajita peppers none just rice beans and chicken  i immediately called back the manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if i was close she would have the order remade and take the entire order off my bill since i was feeding more than myself i decided that i would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned well i drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology the worse part about this is i should have cut my losses but this is the same place that i hosted by friends bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing this is the same place that i have come for happy hours but tonight i should have said no get home and bam burrito smelled great looked great but no chicken none just beans peppers rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but where is the chicken i didnt bother to call back this time im gonna just cut my losses and not go back not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off twice my nephew agrees he just went to wendys now i hope my refund is correct seems likely the next problemso i came to taco bell here in willingboro only to be served a cold burrito and 2 tacos for a total of 13 and change i was very disappointed and i do not plan to spend another dime at any taco bell until someone addresses this horrible servicenot kid friendly  came here tonight with my toddler and newborn and was joined by a few sets of parent friends with their young children the staff was nice but the clientele were not welcoming to children and made rude comments lets just say that a scene ensued and we showed ourselves out of this unwelcoming establishment  the beer is average as far as breweries in the city are concerned theres plenty of options with better beer better vibes better clientele and way better suited for families trying to have fun with their kids  we regularly visit the breweries of new orleans and decided to try this place out for the sake of trying them all we can say with certainty that they will never see our business or the business of our friends again due to the way their clientele treat families with children  if you want kid friendly go to urban south second line parleauxs  all have a great selection of beer great staff great space for you and your kids to have fun amazing customers and great food options dailythis place was awful i really like mexican food but this place is so not mexican food my hubby and i went for dinner on a tues it was busy for a tues so we were excited we were seated quickly and our server gave us our drinks quickly but it was a downturn after that first the chips and salsa were tasteless i have found better tasting salsa from jar salsa at the grocery store also we waited for ridiculous 45 minutes for our food to come out all we ordered was tacos a burrito and one chicken enchilada simple freaking mealsi mean come on that should take 10 minutes after the server gave us our food finallyhe never came back to check if we needed anything else we could not even flag anyone to refill our waters the burrito and tacos were very bland but edible the chicken enchilada was the worst enchilada i have ever had i couldnt even eat it the red sauce on it tasted like some old can enchilada sauce that has been sitting in their kitchen for awhile after we were done eating we sat there for another 15 minutes before the server came to our table i told him i didnt like the enchilada and he did take it off the check but that doesnt make up for one of the worst service from a restaurant that i have experienced we wont be back good luck poblanos20 for a chimay toxic fumes from the nonstop traffic on florida avenue hyde park wannabeoxygen thieves hang out all you hear at this place is so what do you do what do you drive i dont care if its only a few blocks bike ride from my house its not worth itin no on business and always try to eat where the locals do or at least avoid the chains this place came highly recommended i was all set for a great breakfast and was so disappointed took 30 minutes to get food which was overcooked after sitting under heat lamps totally uninterested and full of attitude service they were busy so may have something to do with it but i wont be backridiculous prices for small portionslittle meatmostly ricei always admired the cakes in the window of this store and wanted to order my daughters birthday cake here the last few years i was very excited when my husband agreed on the cake boutique to make our cake for her 5th this year i wanted a nice five layer cake and no expense was to be spared i cannot even begin to tell you how shocked i was at their terrible customer service the lady showed me the different cakes and informed me on how much each one was i told her i liked the three tier cake but might need something bigger since i specifically wanted five layers she told me the basic starting price and let me know decorations would cost more i was fine with that and told her i would like to get the order started when i asked her if i could taste a few flavors she said they dont let people taste for free but i could buy some cupcakes if i wanted to when i asked if the cupcakes in the case were all the flavors they made she just shrugged her shoulders and said i think so so i bought a chocolate yellow and raspberry filled cupcake i sat at the table to taste them  i noticed after i sat down there was a sign on the table that said reserved for cake tasting  i then asked her if there was delivery available since i did not want to risk driving with the cake myself and possibly ruining it she said for an additional 50 i could get it delivered i told her my major cross streets and she said she was going to check on something and would be right back while she was gone i tasted the cupcakes and i could not believe how dry and bland they were i was really shocked the raspberry filled one was a little better tasting but not by much i really cannot tell you what specific flavor they were because she didnt tell me so as i waited for her i decided not to use them i can put up with bad customer service if the product is at least amazing but after i sampled it there was no way i was going to pay 600 for a cake and get treated the way i did and have it taste horrible on top of all that so just because they have a fancy store and nice displays dont just assume that the service is great and the product is good i will stick with nadines they have outstanding customer service and the cakes never let me downcustomer service here is actually awful had a girl named danea not sure if spelling as she did not wear a name tag she asked me what i wanted to order and was gossiping to a coworker about godonlyknows while i was speaking when she brought the wrong item and i told her what i had actually ordered she snapped back you didnt say that um yes i did you clearly werent listening she remade the order while sighing loudly when she brought the new item back she walked away to  gossip again near the stores walkin when she came back i asked how much my order would be it was starting to melt and i was becoming annoyed she said i cant just add it up in my head hold on okay more waiting when we finally paid i said can i have spoons for my order she gave me a smile and started counting out individual spoons one at a time like she was happy to make me wait this ordeal took over 15 minutes while people were waiting in line behind me ive been coming to this location since i was a child but with all of the other locations in the area ill be making a trip elsewhere as long as they employ rude people like thisworst italian restraint i ever been to took 15 minutes for someone to wait on us and she walked by us 4 times no personality the food was luke warm and old or burnt was the worse i ever hadordered curbside pickup service and its a total fail i arrived and called the number no answer called again a couple minutes later they answered waited as instructed and waited when found out the pizza was never cooked another twenty minutes they said the manager would come out to explain another ten minutes the food arrives with no manager the pizza was cold so how was it fresh out of the oven total disappointmentworst experience ever  i called ahead twenty minutes to let the restaurant know that i needed a table for eleven people  i was told that they didnt take reservations and that id have to let the hostess know when we arrived about our party size  it was very upsetting that they couldnt accommodate this  we arrived in twenty minutes as planned and told the hostess we needed a table for eleven people  the hostess dropped her jaw and shook her head and said it would be a twenty minute wait  45 minutes later we still had no tablewe asked to speak to the manager  the managers name is carrie  the manager was extremely rude  the three hostess are very rude as well  they couldnt even figure out to connect 3 tables together to accommodate a table of eleven  the manager then proceeded to throw her hands in our faces yell say she couldnt help us and continue with dirty looks  its unacceptable behavior  i would like to say that our waiter javier was kind professional and efficient  but i wont be backnot feeling this place i was so excited about this place opening in philly area the place has no atmosphere at all it is all the same colors and is very boring you couldnt tell who was an employee and who was a customer they had no tshirts or anything the line was long because they only have 1 register no menu board on the wall or anything place is very cheap though with their prices so i will give em that they dont even have a fountain soda machine or an ice machine the food all tasted the same really bland and flavorless i asked for extra salsa and they said i had to pay for it really how do you sell a huge basket of chips and give 1 small 3 oz cup of salsa also when i went they had no sign so i blew by the place dont open unless your ready to open and obviously this place isnt ready i cant see this here for more than a year or socouldnt eat because no one would seat me or take order here for a conference people have short lunches why understaff why no hostess why no clear togo process you are in a conference hotel managment or corporate need to address leadership here saw food sitting in window just dyingfood is not bad ie standard cosi glorified fast food  however this particular restaurant has the rudest employees i have ever met in my life  asking for a fork is a huge burden on them for which i must apologize  i am so sorry i need a fork to eat a salad  also the workflow here is weird  they act like youre a huge idiot for not knowing you order salad at one end and soup at the registers  signs might help  tomato basil was dec thoughagree with past post used to be great service not anymore  last week we went there to have lunch and enjoy the play palace both of our happy meals were wrong and all of our fries were undercooked and flat out disgusting  drive thru this time both happy meals again messed up no apple slices at all luckily i noticed they messed up our drinks was able to get those fixed also asked for strawberry and vanilla shake got strawberry and chocolate   glad there is a chick fil a that is on my way home as well when im needing that easy once in awhile dinner wont be going backcashier was rude and black and blue salad was partially frozen mostly brown pieces of lettuce and all for 9 no thanks steak was less than 3 oz very poor quality and obviously no manager to overseeas 45 put it best  this place is a hole   to the people in charge of the entire brand steak and shake  take note of how freddys operates ditch the worthless waiters who understandably are as motivated to return to the table as i am the proctologist   its flipping 399 meals and half the customers are kids of course you wont make crap for tips   put up a coke freestyle machine and have people place and order up front ill get my own refills and napkins faster mind you and with pleasure   ps  its not normal to had a 4 year old a fully loaded plate of foodmy partner stopped here on her way after work to pick up a carryout order the cashier refused to accept her groupon because her tablet was not connected to the internet so she called me at home to make the 20 minute drive to her location to use my device which has a data plan to complete the purchase upon arriving i asked the cashier if you were in my shoes what would it take to make this order worth it considering that the pizza will be 4050 minutes old by the time we get home the cashiers response was to assure me that delivery customers pizzas were at least this old by the time they received them i took this to mean that no this was indeed not worth the headache we refused the order cancelled our groupon purchase and took our business elsewherewait is not worth it almost an hour and they dont seem to have any sense of urgency and the air conditioning is spotty its a good product but i wont be back and theyre lucky this is tampa and not seattle with this kind of wait little seating and no air  this place would have never survived in a market with competition they need to get a better system for serving people if they want to remain open after the new ness wears off i wont be back and im willing to bet this is a lot of peoples first and last visit i wish them well though and want them to succeed but they have to fix the air and wait timeseven the beer tastes better at the tap room of you want a true schlafly experience head downtown to the tap room  better food better service all around better experience every timecalled in to pick up my order but when i arrived they acted as though they never spoke to me i was told id have to wait an extra 10 minutes on top of the 15 minutes of previous waiting the food was undercooked and the service staff was incredibly rude ill never return to this placeordered a couple of pizzas for delivery i swear a cheap frozen pizza tastes better it was semi warm bland and they must have been low on cheese that nightsunday not so fun day at schlafly came in cool music live outside go inside to grab a bite and drink  we sat inside for around 15 minutes no server they had like 4 bartenders two waitresses and 2 bar backs yet no one even approached   i do not recommend maplewood on sunday at all bad experienceterrible service under new ownership  old clientele are ignored while customers from owners previous job are given top notch attention   food quality has gone down and prep errors up  can no longer justify spending money here  queso fundido ordered with jalepenos and you get none  if you order flour tortillas you get corn  dirty beer glassesits 1129pm they close at 1am their kitchen closes  at 12am so when we asked to be sat on the rooftop the hostess non mostest said that all the tables are dirty and that she personally would have to set that up for us we told her not to worry about it and adiosd mfterrible overrun with pretentious yuppies babies and dogs no point in standing in line for small portions that are overpriced i left and had dinner elsewhere good idea terrible executionbeen here three times i live in the neighborhood 1st time they had me pull around and wait for fresh fries they got my order wrong  2nd time i waited about 10 minutes in line before i got to the speaker box only to be told to wait after 3 additional minutes i gave up 3rd time did me in  after waiting 6 minutes to talk to the speaker box i got to order and ordered a 12 pack no alterations no substitutions   when i got home i discovered they were too lazy to put the pickles and onions on  i complained to corporate and the  district manager did attempt to make communication but im done  no free food is gonna bring me back  ill just stop elsewhere if i krave my krystalsthis place was disgusting we used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast the place was dirty garbage cans overflowing garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldnt be used nothing was filled up sauce cups napkins silverware the chicken was very dry and couldnt even be cut with the plaatic knife well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of mefood is good  decor is nice   service was terrible  our drink orders were not what we ordered  rather than tell us they dont carry certain items  they made up their own drinks  it was terribly disappointingbeen here before so had high expectations  ended up with mediocre burger and fries delivered by an indifferent server who clearly wished she was elsewhere  the  tiny patty on our burgers was overwhelmed by the lettuce tomato and onion garnish and came with a stingy portion of room temperature fries  total price for two was 2799  very disappointing  i will not be backi stopped going this bk and usually avoid all bk  i dont know if all bk are like this one or is this location uniquely bad whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast when they do answer to take your order its never friendly or welcoming once i thought i heard someone say yea what u want but i will give the benefit of the doubt i miss heard nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldnt take long it seems as if they dont start until you have paid because they ask for me to pull around i understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable but no you can hear them holding conversations that if were management they would be fired on the spot you get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them then after waiting they bring your order to your car and say nothing no sorry for the wait or bla bla i have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way either something is missing or they ignored my request all together  you then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave  the last time i left i swore to never go back if someone from management reads this if you want to know why your store is dying look at your employees first then quality controldont get a to go order you will get a tiny burger and have added gratuity added not a good pick at all my bill for two burgers to go was 40 bucksat their previous location i tried phat bites it was dirty and gross i literally saw the guy mixing a potato salad with his bare hands and then wipe his nose to return to mixing   years later at their new location i decided to give them another chance i will concede they said they have a new cook this morning but my oh my the food was so bland and undercooked and just overall gross its bad enough that the environment is reminiscent of a garage sale turned restaurant  where the items were kept in their original condition by failing to clean them but on top of that its just overall dirty   now the icing on this dirty cake is that the servers if you can call them that are not kind they are unaware of the menu they act like its a burden to help they need training one guy was way more concerned with air drumming than attending to my drink order   its a bunch of young people poorly trained making gross food in a dirty environment where theyre too cheap to provide real silverware or even a salt shaker and way overpriced i got to pay 50 for my crap experience   seriously let this place be overtaken by the mold thats likely growing in the corner of the room   thank you   i will never return to this place againposted hours indicate a 9pm closing on monday nights last night at 853 the door was locked not a big deal but as i glanced at the hours a surly clerk near the door said in a rather mean tone it doesnt matter anyway goodbye  really thats how you do business be shitty and antagonistic to customers because you close early   ive spent my final dime in am spirits there are other optionsbleh their food is so gross if you order late and for pickup i gave them more than one chance and i regret itbad attitudes dry rock hard pastry not worth the effort of going there or the costslowest service at night daytime people are fine actually saw a worker older white lady walking around without her shoes on  very gross hope the health department and owner sees this and looks at the time and date and takes care of businesswe walked in with every intention to spend a good amount of money on souvenirs my husband gave me a kiss in the store and she kicked us out and told us it is a place of business and we need a hotel meanwhile she was eating her lunch  at the register and chomping away and didnt even great us yikes hope they reconsider their tacticsi went to the apple bees in this location and it was an unpleasant experience the tables i arrived at were dirty when i ordered i got a salad and the 2 for 20 meal for me and my uncle when the food arrived my soda tasted like windex and my uncles rice on his plate was like eating plastic pellets it was clearly overcooked i will definitely not be returning to this applebees anytime soon thank you for reading my reviewhorrible i wish we read the reviews before going in what a downer this place was  let us sit for an hour and then brought out cold food  my two grand sons were with and they were pinging off the wall by the time the cold food got to our table   i have literally been to ihops all over and hands down this was the worst experience we have ever had  generally i think of ihop as a safe bet while traveling but this may have ruined that rep for goodwhat a drag entrees bolognese and lasagne are too salty lemoncello cake is just sponge cake with strawberry sauce now  drove here from franklin with high expectations and wont be back  salmon was blackened as expected but terribly over cooked to the point of being dry as shoe leather  sadmy son got a pho and thought it was ok my daughter got the tofu pad thai and she said it was horrible it tasted very bland with almost no flavor also it was super spicy all in all we didnt really like the food hererecently moved into their delivery area and called in an order friday night while my wife and i painted and pulled down wallpaper  one large specialty pizza was ordered and i was told 3045 minutes    our house is on the same street as their store so no way the driver got lost  after an hour and a half with no pizza and no call i called back to cancel the order  a man answered the phone in the typical pickup or delivery fashion  i stated that i would like to cancel a delivery order i placed more than 90 minutes ago  without asking my name address or order he simply said okay and hung up on me  awful customer service  i never got to try the pizza but a missed opportunity to gain a new customer in the area  i wont be giving them another chanceconveniently located but they jack the price up unfairly when they feel like it watch them when they ring you up when you buy alcoholvery unfriendly to people with dietary restrictionsallergies refused to make an accommodation  wouldnt come here againmy order has been either incorrect overcharged or cold each and every time i have come if you are fine sacrificing quality of food and service for a cheaper price though this could be the place for you just dont speak up about a mistake if you fear the staff andor manager will give you attitude because it may happenworst wawa ever its filthy being filthy isnt even the worst part of this store the worst part is the customer service or lack there of the employees here act as if they are being forced to workand they aint happy about it i went to the cashier to pay and since i didnt receive a greeting i extended one myself nothing no hello no goodbye no thanks and have a good day i find it hard to believe this store cant obtain better employees who arent angry that they have to come to work at wawa someone from management may want to clean housei really truly hate giving bad reviews but i cant help it this time before i check a place out i refer to yelp and boy did i get an eyeful when i read about the broken beaker distillery vodka tasting like dirt i wanted to give it a chance anyway i never knew there was dirt flavored vodka but they sell it and its expensive you can drink while the tv is turned down so you cant hear it while there is no music on and while they ignore you and talk amongst themselves behind the bar rude the glassesbeakers that the drinks were served in were neat but there was barely anything in there to drink at all and for nearly 10 dont get me started on the food and how when your ordering they make you think the side comes with it by asking whats your side only to be given your bill to see that sides are extra the sandwich was just like one you couldve made at home not even worth a description i really hate it but 1 star is all i can give i hope they make it big with dirt flavored vodkaawful awful awful went in today to have lunch with my husband we ordered we get to the register and they inform us theres no ice for the drinks we ordered do we still want them i say yes because i made the wrongful assumption that the soda would at least be cold and drinkable boy was i wrong not only was it hot but it had no carbonation what so ever now mine you we paid for these drinks i dont know about you but ive worked in the food industry and my store has ran out of ice before and we went to the grocery store and bought bags of ice brought them back and made sure our customers were happy until we could fix the situation apparently that was not the managers idea at this store so instead of just saying sorry our drink situation sucks today u can have it for free they charge us i went to 5 guys and got us cold drinks we started eating our burritos were disgusting they tasted like cat food and the chips were completely plain no lime or salt at all clearly someone has dropped the ball at this chipotle because it was complete garbage i hope they can turn this store around because theyve now lost a customerbad bad bad  why  1  ice cream is not quality especially the banana  chocolate unless you like those cheap circus peanut candies cause it tastes like that  the chocolate is nothing special a little bland they use the cheapest of ice creams and the taste proves it   my mother had a business and we know this brand cheap for businesses to purchase  2  the counter person  it was hours before closing when i went and all she kept saying out loud was how she was never going to get out of here  she complained the entire time to her coworker friends who were just as loud and non professional  3  portions are good but take out ice cream in cheap cups and the spoons can even handle a scoop before it breaks  4    if you are going to spend your money go to haggen daaz   i wouldt have even given this place one star but you have toi went here with a group of friends during restaurant week and it was the complete opposite from what we were expecting we heard that it was the best crab in philadelphia so why wouldnt we want to try it as one of the guys put it we felt like we were at bingo night as soon as we walked in no big deal tho we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early knowing we would most likely have to wait a little nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through the boys were fine they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd when we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes thank goodness our server began the countdown i have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us okay guys about 7 more minutes then return a few minutes later and say alright well we have about 3 more minutes left and as annoying as it was he made us all laugh so it was fine i ordered the rw special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake and it was okay i would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it the best part of the entire experience was the store bought chocolate cake we had for dessert as they vacuumed around ushorrible service they asked us to put the baby carrier on the floor instead of giving us a bigger table are you kidding i felt completely guilty to have suggested the place unbelievably lousy service never againi would not recommend this hotel as my experience here was not the best experience as my room was accessed and items stolen  not a safe place to stayhad to wait over 2 hours for food delivery drivers dont know their way around and cant seem to knock on a door this store is pathetic i will never order from this location againterrible customer service  nice beautiful sunday afternoon we wanted to sit outside have a drink and eat a late lunch  the hostess took us to our table which was in the sun all the other tables were under the pavilion in the shade and there was a table with young kids right next to this table  we wanted a nice quiet lunch to ourselves since it was a day without kids for us we asked to sit on the other side where it was quieter and it was in the shade  we were told we could not sit there because there was no server there  i asked if the server could maybe walk two tables over she said no  we went inside and asked for a manager and we were directed to the same hostess yet again and was told they didnt know who the manager would be that we need to talk to  we were so excited when we walked up because it was the perfect atmosphere on the perfect day to be outside  needless to say we did not stay and will never go backim really not sure why i keep going back heremaybe because its the only subway i know of between city ave and wayne but i should stop the customer service is worse each time i go back the woman who works there is incredibly slow and the younger man is slow  rude im not sure why making a sandwich for me is such a burden for someone who works in a sandwich store but maybe its because im interrupting his chainsmoking  this morning the man decided that he should take his time to finish preparing his coffee before he got around to making my sandwich and apparently he isnt clear on the fact that you should wash your hands before you prepare food gloves or not even though it was only about 930am when i went there they were somehow already out of some ingredients dont goemployees never have grille items always slacking at the easiest job ever how hard is iteven worse now absolutely no food on grille at 1100bugs everywhere    wow needed a drink  and they literally stole 02 and still no grille food nwe were looking forward to trying out this newly redone restaurant the atmosphere is fresh and well done  we were there for breakfast they now have table service things were great until the food came out my pancakes tasted like stale bread  my wifes eggs were cold the potatoes were not cooked they brought the wrong side dishes for silverware we were given  forks but no knives it took a while to find a waiter to get the silverware we needed we did speak to the manager she offered a discount of 250  not that we were looking one but why bother however she did not remove the extra charge for the incorrect side dish we didnt order 400  she did apologize for the food verbally but somehow we were made to feel like she couldnt care less i dont write many reviews unless i really love something or dislike something this restaurant fits into the latter category sorry a nice decor is not enoughthis place has gone downhill since they opened few months ago they need to improve cleanliness big timethis use to be one of my favorite places for livers  gizzards but now their food is too too too salty its like are you trying to give people high blood pressure with all that salt maybe corporate can initiate some changeswent back with my mom because i couldnt think of better competition at the time shes much more keen to detail specifically cleanliness we took our food to go as she was jaw dropped at how unkept this place is also worth mentioning is that over my many drop ins for a quick coffee the coffee counter has never once been fully stocked too many one star visits was great in comparison to the one up easton road that closed now is just grossvery disorganized my boss called in an order for 5 people at 1030am to be picked up at noon i went with her to assist carrying the order back to the office a list of things that went wrong after that 1 when we arrived at noon the order was not ready we were told however that it was almost ready and just needed to be bagged she paid and we waited near the entrance 2 15 minutes later with others waiting for lunch at the office no word on our order 3  she tried to go back to the register to check on the order while i went to check to see if our order was in the carry out window nothing furthermore the boss was stuck another 510 minutes behind a customer demanding a refund  4 when she finally got to the counter we found out our order was ready but no one had bothered to tell the counter that it was ready to go 5 the order was brought out looking like food for 5 people was smashed into a bag made for 2 orders  6 the clerk offered 5 cinnamon rolls for our inconvenience fine however the rolls ended up being crammed into the bottom of a larger bag with our original order crammed on top  7 the clerk then darted to the back to get us utensils which for some bizarre reason took another 5 minutes he also put in utensils for 25 people into the already full bag 8 when we finally arrived back at the office we were treated to one wrong order room temperature soup and a panini that looked like it had been stepped on   yes it was crowded at lunch there but thats no excuse for horrendous service and terrible communication especially for an order that had been called in an hour and a half early  this panera location really needs to step up its gamewent to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly then came the food they had several options i had the pick three of sausage brisket and ribs the two sides were beans and greens out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse all were dry and the sides did not have favors i would expect i did not like anything you even had to pay for bread  i tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting the sweet was pure molasses the house was the only one i could tolerate  i think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds we tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture  the price was crazy never again go to one of the many bbq places in st louis that actually has good foodvisiting st louis last week  had a lovely time with family at a wedding out in the country our last stop before leaving was the botanical gardens we happened on olio and had a nice chat  refreshment with the staff they referred us to your establishment for a pastry before we left town walked in stood at the counter  watched 4 staff ignore us one on the phone one taking a break and 2 just talking behind the counter we really wanted to taste your assortment  take back some treats from your shop please get your customer service together so people dont feel snubbed good luckso they renovated the place and now it has more counter space i thought now they possibly can fit in more baristas and improve the quality of the drinks but i was deeply disappointed again we ordered two lattes and the barista steamed the milk in a big pitcher then poured out both of them at once so instead of two lattes we got one has too much milk form like a cappuccino and another one is basically hot coffeeflavored milk without much form i would go to joes or elixir nearby insteadthis is the slowest pharmacy i have ever seen always a line 67 deep to pick up and 34 cars blocking traffic due to backups in the drive thru chronically understaffed a true failure of management in actionquite the professional response caroline  yes i do have quite a palate eating off the streets of manhattan for years makes one quite the critic  saltytoo much freaking salt do you understand this  and medium lamb doesnt mean a plate of blood you reject  grow up and take criticism well you are a smallok place  deal with itover priced  over rated  totally disappointing  no jelly donuts  how can any self respecting donut place not have a jelly donut luckily the coffee was decentrecently had a horrible experience here service we were seated at a table to which none of the servers were apparently assigned everyone just kept walking by our table and ignored us after 15 min my husband flagged someone down  host came over apologized and got our drinks   food definitely not worth the ridiculous prices  my shrimp cocktail was so tough i couldnt chew it  scallops were ok but definitely not the best i ever had and not at all worth the price 32  it was served with some watery cauliflower that they called pured  my husbands 42 filet mignon was a piece of tasteless stringy meat  host asked how our food was and he agreed that the meat looked stringy and explained that he appreciated the feedback because they are trying a new meat provider  offered to get something else but we declined just wanted to get out we were offered free dessert  ambience sounded like we were eating in the casino game area  noisy very bright lighting  one of the ceiling recessed lights was shining directly on me like a spotlight i actually brought it to our waiters attention and asked if they could be turned down  he simply said no and walked away furnishings look so dated including the fake fish tank on the big gold wall  will not return for those kind of prices there are soooo many better restaurantsi love you guys but seriously i show up on tuesday five minutes after noon to grab a gyro at the delithe attendant finishes up with a customer before me then when shes done tells me to hold onshe proceeds to go and clean the grill and then puts approximately 20 pounds of ground beef on the grill about 7 minutes later when she returns i make casual conversation asking if shes making chili and she says no shes getting ready for taco wednesday  i then order my gyro and then she tells me that she cant do hot food today because the grill is already being used for the ground beef for the tacos that they will be serving tomorrow  ok its lunch time why are you not focused on lunch i ended up going to blues city deli and waited in a line of 10 people and still managed to get my sandwich 5 minutes after entering their deli i will give you guys another chance and will take down this review if i see improvement but you need to know that i think you guys can do so much betternice food but dont go to this place when their busy time such as brunch time    after we ordered about half hour our food still not show up and we ask the server that we waiting long time you know what our server told us you guys only waited 22 mins what the hell is that answer supposed to be  and we ask separate check the guy said we dont do separate check when we are busy  well i dont offer tip when you busy then who fking caresfood is typical steak n shake my issue here is with the service awful awful awful took my kids for breakfast and waited over 30 minutes for pancakes and eggs asked for salsa ate entire breakfast before it showed up coffee refill  promised but never delivered i dont expect mcdonalds speed but this is steak n shake not a full service restaurant should be able to get in and out relatively quicklyincredibly loud i came by to get a little computer work done but unfortunately only left with a pounding headache the main culprit was the incessant banging of the barrista trying to empty the espresso maker over and over and over and over is there no other way    i have gone to coffee shops to work for years and have never been bothered by this noise however here its just too much i will not returnwould never come back to this quiznos again we showed up at 1050am on sunday and sign says doesnt open till 11am which i can respect so i waited in my car till 11am and then i go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and i the one minute signal through the window we stand outside and wait mind you its winter and cold we wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us its not open yet the  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 1105 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else they could have at least allowed us to wait inside clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this storeit was a horrible dining experience the food is not good theyre a very un organized  i seen a lot of unhappy people im sure the owner is very unhappygetting all these horrible reviews but my experience is true  change things  hurry or you wont be thereawful noise and constant interruptions by staff to ask how things are going  ridiculous dancing etc never againgoy a headache in about 10 minuteswent because we had a groupon wouldnt go back again granted there was a large table next to us 8 or 9 but we had put our order in before they sat took over 20 minutes for our appetizers to come out drinks were never brought to the table nor was bread had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer we order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams which were very fresh the shrimp cocktail that came out was not  i ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs would have been better if the crab legs werent water logged the shell had no crispness to it i honestly opened each leg by tearing the shell like paper  my wife ordered the softshell crabs which were delicious but we couldnt finish them because our dishes were cleared  total bill came out to 10200 not worth the wait or the foodi dont understand the hubbub about burritos that are 75 rice no wonder they call themselves healthy i wish someone would open a baja fresh in tucson much betteri cant believe theyre charging 10 to park dont they get enough of our money already theyve lowered themselves to the lowest of the lowest moneygrabbing some balls i can tell you one thing for sure we will never ever be returning to this place biloxi is a drive up the highway but id rather go there than ever returning here if i could give them no stars woulddisgustingly over priced they have a wonderful mouth watering beer selection but cmon this is not even ny prices i realize pa law is part of the problem here but foodery beer prices are just too high i have been on boycott for years i would rather go to one of the great beer bars around or pick up beer in nj than give this place my i experienced the worst customer service possible ive waited 15 minutes for an employee to ask me if i was being taken care of while my food was done and sitting and also the sodas in the refrigerator were expired and out of date i contacted the manager on duty and the employee did nothing i tried giving them another chance and this continues to be an issue i will no longer come to this locationif you cant come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then dont work at a mcdonalds where people are in a hurry to get somewhere elseso disappointed in the behavior of humans1 ambiance ehh its nice to sit by the fountains but you have a busy road at your back so the illusion isnt that great  2 rude and unfriendly staff every time i go i feel like they are doing me a favor by serving me or making my coffee 3 for a plae that boasts itself familyfriendly they sure dont seem to like kids  4 pretentious for nothing its just not as fancy as they pretend to be  5 food is mediocre coffees dont taste like coffee the young girls who work there arent good baristas desserts are lousy i have never had anything that tastes indulgent they try to copy the style of the french bakeries in the area and even whole foods but the taste falls flat they tout their triple berry cake as the greatest dessert in town id rather buy whole foods berry chantilly cake at least its fresh from thereive tried going here four times with no success because the drive tru takes so long that i have pulled away every single time great job idiotsmy experience with this particular store was sigh eye roll i felt uncomfortable from the time i left my car to checking out i was stared at the entire time maybe i was turning colors going from aisle to aisle idk lmaooo however i retrieved the item i came for the cashier at selfcheckout was nice though and would you know she spoke too lol it takes one positive moment to outweigh every other trivial thing   thank god there are way more locations with great customer service and better stocked stores and girl my amex will go where im accepted and celebratedok so dont worry the revolution wont be televised in the frozen fruit section im good i wont be back  but this is was oakville i acknowledged where i was and i know what it iswhat is this the worst overpriced airport food breakfast sandwich  why yes yes it is  look i realize airport food is what it is on all price and flavor accounts but this was worse than anything i have ever eaten at an airport  this was definitely assembled earlier in the morning and just reheated  the bacon was limp and very under cooked and the slice of cheese wasnt even a kraft cheese single but a knock off cheese single  the croissant wasnt fresh baked and you feel a little robbed when you are chewing on leather while having paid over 700 for just a sandwich  the coffee was burnt and old in flavor either that or it was instant and i am not sure which is true  there are many more options in this place and if you cant find one grab a bag of doritos instead and you will be happiersounded good went to try it at 1030 sunday morning  big mistake  too many ignorant yuppies who dont realize its rude to sit for 20 minutes chatting over coffee while seats are at a premium in a small restaurant  which was ok because no one was working the register to take orders   maybe another day but for now this place is a victim of its hypetheyve yet to get even my most basic of orders right iced black coffee and when i do order specialty coffees they suck i ask for extra espresso every time and even though theyll charge me for it they rarely add it specialty lattes theyll taste like mostly milk service is also mediocre they will give me the correct drink if i drive back but who wants to have to drive back every time not to mention it comes with a side of attitude   whoever is running this place please get it togetherwhen your waitress says the kitchen is crashing and burning you know this isnt going to go well my husbands beer sat empty while she focused on her only other table another waitress stepped in to get him a refill two of our three meals came out thinking his pizza was on the way we went ahead and started eating 15 mins later his pizza is mia and the waitress was confused as to why he wanted to cancel his order and have it taken off the bill there was no manager visible and the situation couldve been handled much better its a shame because they have great food and good beer we wont be backmy husband picked up 2 acai bowls for me and our 2 year old son at the west nashville location my bowl was great but im thankful my son did not eat his i ate his bowl for breakfast the following morning and it had 3 huge pieces of plastic in it it was disgusting and very dangerous if my son had eaten that i contacted the urban juicer to tell about our experience their head of hr emailed me back within 24 hours apologizing saying she already contacted the store to ensure it wouldnt happen again and said the ceo would issue me a refund and a 10 gift certificate its been over a week and i have not received a refund or gift certificate i sent a followup email this morning but still have yet to hear back im bummed about this entire experience because i loved urban juicerbut this experience was disgusting dangerous and handled poorly by managementi am honestly so appalled at the service and standards at this place regardless of the food quality which is fine for new orleans the service is horrible  lilian was our server and it took her at least 8 minutes to greet us and take our orders water came about 5 minutes later and she just placed the waters down on the table and threw some straws down while she was at it no here you go or smile on her face   meanwhile a gentleman came and offered us food that we never ordered guess he meant to go to a different table   when our appetizers came another woman yelled out avocado rolls doesnt wait for anyone to claim them she just puts them on the table shrimp roll slides on table shrimp and pork roll slides on table and then 1 of 3 drinks arrives and it just go slam dab in the middle of the table with no regard as to who ordered it generally its bad enough to offer food to a table waiters should always know who ordered what but to just throw it on the table like that is straight rude  two of the other drinks came after the food just generally a bad standard of service to have food come before drinks   food finally came and it was fine employees were too busy to even clear tables to seat parties waiting at the door the kicker was they sat two parties of two at a table of four basically these poor people had to share a table that is normally just a table for 34 not a communal table   my friends and i already discussed tipping at or below 15 for the sht service was taking way too long to get our table cleared and our check but we noticed a 20 gratuity added to the bill because they add that for parties of four or more literally nowhere on earth adds the charge for 4 its always at minimum 6 and some places even do 18 not 20   i asked a waitress to take it off because it is illegal to force a customer to pay gratuity and she argued with me for a minute before taking it off oh and also the gratuity is included in the tax calculation so you pay tax on the gratuity also illegal   scammy business with trash servers who literally do not give a crap about their job i would only go back if the automatic gratuity was removed and the service improves obviously it affects the work ethic of the waiters because they know they automatically get 20 in the bag if a table of 4 comes in and therefore lose motivation to provide good servicei had heard good things about fresh produce but i have to say i was not impressed i noticed that my sunflowers and blueberries were moldy upon arriving home  the tomatoes there were all bruised and mushy  the only thing i think that i might be happy with are my apples  not to mention the woman that rang me up threw around my produce and bruised it all up  i wont be backlong time regular of hooters in the florida and now defunct ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in arizona   ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told i cannot have one alone  thats ok   i remember living in ohio the hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some tampa stores   after this all downhill   waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    i explained it is no problem and i seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone  ok  i was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the hooters anywhere never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years   listen  now you made an issue of a non issue   it was the way they were in columbus ohio   experienced it many times  i did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce and  then mr know it all had to speak up again saying florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it  have since found from 2 florida important hooters management people that 1  they will never change over and 2 other one says they are really fighting it  the outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though  beautiful store just try not to engage manager  willregretthe pho is abysmal there is no flavor to it it literally tastes like boiled water the noodles were clumped together when the bowl got to me which means they didnt make the noddles fresh but theyve been sitting around for some time the meat used in the pho is was chewyi go here 34 times a week as it is around the corner from work but no more the staff are rude and the owner is the worst the old lady that is their every day was compaling that he was not in and she was all by her self and i can see where is was coming from as 12 people were in line and it took over 20 minutes to order my sub the owner did arrive finally when i was second in line and he actually took my order he asked me what do you want extreamly rude but this is not the worst which i replied a ft long honey oat with buffalo chicken he then asks what bread i once again say honey oat foot long and then he says ok ft long what type of bread do you want i said this is the third time i have told you honey oat he got the picture yay he put the cheese on and toasted the sub he then said what else do you want i am shocked by the rudeness but i just dont say anything except lettuce tomato cucumber so he puts the lettuce and cucumbers on and forgets the tomato i have just about had enough so i said stop slow downhe was rushing and not paying attention to what is going on and the lady told him i said tomato and she was making some one elses sub and listen to what i am saying because i should not have to keep repeating my self his reply is so do you want this sub i said yes i do and i do not appreciate the attitude because i have been waiting over 20 minutes because you were late to work his reply was do not speak to me like that and i just lost it i did not swear at him i just explained how unprofessional he is being and the fact his consists of making a sub and he does not have the capacity to do so he then asks again do want the sub i reply yes of course i need to eat lunch sometime today he then throws my sub in the bin and says get out during this 4 or 5 people walked out because of his attitude its fair to say i will not be going back ever again stay awayas a new englander i have experience with many dunkins and this is by far the worst i have ever been to and i have been to a lot   some highlights include  milk cream that tastes sour  red hair in my drink  overall unsanitary  debatably some of the rudest customer service   i tell my friends that this isnt what dunkins is about who dont have many where they are from unfortunately this a sad excuse for a franchisei had not patronized mcdonalds in many years as there are many other establishments that actually seem to work for their customers business   it took over five minutes before one of the four employees asked gruffly if i had been waited on i placed an order for a 1 meal which is their big mac as i waited for 14 minutes to get my meal several other customers approached the counter  complaining about their order accuracy i watched as several people had to repeat this process three or more times before getting their order right or they gave up in frustration no staff member including the english speaking managersupervisor ever apologized or acknowledged the customers exasperation it gave the assistance if caring at all   i figured with my long wait that i would at least get a hot fresh meal but apparently my food must have been praised long before my arrival i received a cold big mac that was half unassembled in the box with my side of cold soft fries not sure why it took 20 minutes from the time i arrived at the counter until i received my order since the time was obviously not doesnt preparing my food and there were not many other customers in the store   lack of employee engagement lack of empathy and poor or no management seemed to be the order of the day here how on earth they can keep the doors open with every customer on site complaining and no response or concern from staff is simply amazingwe came in just before noon and there was just one other couple in the restaurant the drive thru traffic was slow   however every single table was dirty  we asked for a cloth to clean off a table with youd think that might encourage them to send someone out to do some cleanup but no we wiped our table ourselves and returned the cloth to the counter   after this the restaurant got busier and the tables remained filthy someone finally came out to wipe down tables about halfway through our meal after several more customers had to wipe down their own tables   as for the food i wasnt impressed with that either i ordered the mini sirloin burgers and they arrived over cooked and dry even the buns were burnt in places plus only 1 of the 3 burgers actually had any grilled onions on it and then only a very small amount most of the toppings lay at the bottom of the carton   the whole experience was very unsatisfying and i would be reluctant to come back here anytime soonwhere i think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer i just cannot recommend this place i had purchased a groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out when i got there i decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies i wanted to buy once i got around to the back of the store buy the beer wine and dried goods i started to smell the stench of cigarettes at first i was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock but then i walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly i choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as smoking in the office and yeah its a dirty habit not addressing that its illegal in the state of florida to smoke inside a business like this you know the whole indoor clean air act besides i dont want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air the only reason i bought anything was to use my groupon but on second thought i should have just walked out empty handed   i dont think they understand the purpose of groupon it is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers in this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again what a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwisenice to receive a message from kerry  the whole foods team promised to send a gift card due to the bad sausage never received guess she is just a person who pretends they carei have ordered from this sushi restaurant via uber many times because of their sashimi  i gave it another try tonight well this is what this restaurant gave me for 50 worth of sashimiwell after attempting to enter the dining area at 1129pm the doors were locked heres the hourswow this was our first time trying this pizzaand our last quick hint guys pizza is supposed to have sauce on it and this new thing we like to call cheese  the pizza was undercooked and cold when it arrived congrats guys now i finally know why prison inmates riot over the food being servedliterally the worst donair that i have ever eaten in my entire life guy who was working was a total creep  i had about 4 pieces of donair meat in the whole thing my friend got a poutine  the gravy was like water  the fries were mush cannot believe how disgusting this place is  never again in my life will i ever return  horrible i cant give a lower rating asked for very simple by the menu orders two burgers in the two for five deal and one value meal burger and the two for five burgers were both not only wrong different burgers but the buns were stale and each one only had some of the toppings and one was missing a meat patty  supposed to be a double the value meal burger was supposed to be a double with bacon and bbq sauce was given a single plain cheeseburger they got the drinks right and the fries were the wrong size so basically we were overcharged for everything there was no line and no one behind us so they werent even busy avoid this locationservice stank  goofed up 5 orders took us 30 min just to cash out  not going backwhy so much hype for this place pineapple caramel donut was dry flavorless too big  dense and needs more caramel topping see pics maybe the filled donuts are better but im not going to spend another 350 to find out there has got to be a better donut in nolafinally getting around to finishing this review  this summarizes our visit on the night of gasparilla    this was without a doubt the absolute the worst service ever after waiting in line for 30 minutes to be seated we sat for 30 more minutes w no waitress visit once we actually did get served and placed our order the food never came  when i walked up to the counter to check on the food the order was never put in we were told to wait for 10 minutes   15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes once the food arrived it was very good but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the childrens bed times at that point  mind you people who arrived after we were seated got their food ate and left before we even saw a slice of our order  nice  recently i read a story that cappys has pretty much barred kids from the joint citing misbehavior  well given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to get a pizza this wont be an issue for me although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait    while i am all for the supporting of local businesses especially in the seminole heights area and definitely see the appeal of a place like cappys it is pretty cool inside and had a nice vibe my experience coupled with the antikids stuff i read pretty much sealed the deal for me  i wont be going back with or without kids  stephannos is right up the road and they make a great pie without the dramawas a loyal customer of this place it has changed hands to a different owner but is the same name bubble tea is now terrible and incredibly watered down they are clearly trying to cut back and prices are more expensive but product is worse its such a shame original lady is no longer their as her bubble tea was the best in the city now its just terrible with no flavour and expensive and all water dont go here anymorenot a fan sorry im clearly in the minority here i had the chicken platter which ended up being a flattened breaded fried chicken cutlet the sauce drizzled on top was syrupy and sweet but not in a good way all i could taste was grease and sweet again i am obviously in the minority with my opinion so maybe my taste buds are just broken but i was not impressedim from hawaii and so i know what sushi should look and taste like in a conveyor belt because we have a lot of those in hawaii  conveyor belt sushi are considered fast sushi and items like kappa maki or miso soup are only 150 and not 3 like yo sushi  i will even post a photo of what a 350 hamachi nigiri should look like  they charge 275 for green tea when it should complimentary on a conveyor belt fast food sushi  i got some ebi ahi hamachi and salmon nigiri and as you can see from the photo the size of the fish is tiny for 5  worst is that husband got sushi from the belt and he said it taste as if thats been sitting there for more than 2 hours  note sushi is only good for 2 hours in room temperature or else that is bad already conveyor belt sushi chef in hawaii keep track of what they put and we see them dispose of the things they know have been sitting out for a while  the most horrible part was the 7 hamachi carpaccio wannabe they had and it was not either hamachi or it was very old hamachi  the texture and taste was more mackerel saba a much cheaper sushi fish than hamachi  never going back there and the bill was 50 which in hawaii that would have fed 4 people with a full stomach at genki or sushi bay or kurukuru and at yo sushi we had to buy a pretzels to get rid of the bad hamachi taste and to satisfy our stomach this place has terrible sushi and a big rip offi showed up late to night market around 920 after just getting out of work incredibly tired and hungry after seeing the lines for tacos and sandwiches the only trucks that were serving real food i turned around walked south towards home and got a sandwich at fuel  living in this neighborhood i was surprised to see so many people walking around taking pictures so excited to eat from a food truck food trust will have to step it up a notch and next goaround i will show up excited to taste rather than expectant to get a meallets be honest one of the tragedies of the human condition is imagination  we have the capacity to dream and fantasize limitless dreams and fantasies we conjure our imagined selves to be these powerful beings without hindrance or handicap and when we are optimists and ambitious people we pursue these dreams with fervent dedication  however unfortunately because we are limited by imperfection we are unable to satisfy every desire dreamed the saltwater grill undoubtedly was born out of this beautiful dream  day dreams of contending with the big boy louisiana seafood restaurants and being the place for riverebend folks to go when its time for that fried seafood platter   but it will never be this if trends continue over priced mediocre food a basic misunderstanding of flavor weird service uncomfortable ambiance  read all the other bad reviews for details when you are growing your business your good reviews only matter a fraction of what your bad reviews are worth take the note saltwater grill  read your bad reviews and make intelligent changes  it seems like every complaint from the bad reviews were duplicated in our experience that seems real lazy  sometimes we must take hard honest looks at ourselves and admit that we cant do all the things well  it appears as if running a restaurant is just not something the folks at saltwater can do well  look i cant skateboard i can keep thinking i can for the rest of my life but the longer i keep this dream alive the more likely i am to break my leg trying to do something stupid know what i meanthe service here was good  its the food that will prevent me from returning the veal parm was dried out and tastelesscome on this is an italian place veal parm should be a goto at any italian place  i then noticed another yelp reviewer had the same experience they did take it off our bill and the managers were very happy we shared the feedbacki normally love baileys range but tonight was extremely disappointing our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four but as the night went on we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us she was attentive to them and checking in on them regularly at one point we were out of water someone else had stopped to bring us more water we had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend but she left so quickly after that that we were not able to order for the rest of the table while we waited we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their foodthey were seated about 20 minutes after us our server could not be found for awhile so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our orderthis was over an hour after we were seated we were seated at 733 but did not get our food until 845 she did not ask if we needed anything else our server never checked in and asked us how our food was she never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long she did ask the four guys behind us many times and i even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz wowhow did they get that deal one of my friends was getting tired so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything then she started to walk away my friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check still no apologies no asking how our food or experience was personally i was ready to walk out but my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus i completely understand that you folks were slammed with the halloween convention in town but its no excuse for poor customer service especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others its going to take me a long time to go back if i ever do i certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon sad and disappointed on many levelsi would much rather go to tijuana flats or publix across the street and get food in there my quesadilla was pretty small salsa was okay but messy counter around where you get sauces rice and chicken bowl we got also was very bland not much spices in it and in all wouldnt go againcomplete fail total rip off artists and shady business dealings the clerk harassed me and threatened me time to contact the authorities  they get 5 starsid give zero stars if i could employee in drive thru couldnt seem to get the simplest order right gave her my card for payment and she reappears 15 minutes later to collect payment wtf after a half hour wait my drinks were left off the order with said employee informing me that i didnt order drinks thats the last time ill be going thereits not a sushi bar and its not a disco club its a hybrid of crap  its a gimmick  the quality of food is poor but the price is high  the techno club music is blaring in your ear so the conversations are really screaming matches  they keep the place so dark so you cant tell how bad the food looks  the wait staff seem like they hate working there  i wouldnt take a date here unless you think its attractive to look at green skin and glowing yellow teeth from the stupid black lights disco ball and epilepsy inducing strobes  the lunch buffet is variation of wrapped up rice to cut corners  the nonsushi items are oily and are sitting out for the entire time of the lunch hours    theyre serving plastic food that should come w a side of glow sticks  maybe they should complete your 90s style rave experience w some ecstasy pills bc thats the only way theyre gonna make their food taste any betterwhat happened  weve been visiting the owners other place epice more than kalamatas  today the food here was awful  nice remodeling job but they changed the steak seasoning and the fattoush salad dressingnot a good idea  we sat next to a lady who overheard us  agreedthis place is lost  everythings just thrown together  the rice must be leftover from friday  disappointedtoday i went into this location around 5 pm and it was completely empty the young girls that were working did not greet me and the girl who took my order was so snotty that i left without completing the order this was my first time here and i had a horrible experience i will not returni wish i could give this indy location a minus5 stars this is my second visit here to find out they dont have any kfc items available whyjust received the flowers for my wifemothers day  i ordered the middle price over 60 delivered very disappointed  had 2 roses one lily open and 2 closed 3 total and the alstroemeria looks like crap  poorly arranged  see pictures supposed to be pink perfection  so ill go up to the acme and buy an arrangement that actually looks good for 40  very poor quality  valueim waiting to get my money back  asked for 4 mcchickens and 2 med fries 4 snack size mcflurries and 2 sodas   nothing was correct  got 1 sandwiche 3 fries 1 soda 3 big mcflurries   what should have be hot was cold what should have been frozen was like milk   and they think they deserve to start at 15hr   what a jokecashier dianna was horrible she informed us theres only one size cup of coffee when right in front of her there was two sizes customers waited 15mins plus for their orders some leaving to make their flight their purchased food was given to other customers cashier dianna expressed there were no cheesecake or bagels although the display windows had items prepared the professionalism was far less then adequate a true disappointmentnot impressed the volcano roll was tasteless and dry with no resemblance to what sushi should be the second roll ordered also had just a slither of tuna which was no match for the over fried shrimp core in short ive had better sushi at kona grilland i dont go there for sushialways bad service everytime  no english and rush cust to out of the way fast while i carry alot of item and no space to put the basket away theydont use their eyes and heart while working  i only come here when asia supermarket in the back dont have what i needwhy does anyone shop here when we have total wine the beer and wine prices are higher than any grocery store in town no one there ever seems to know anything except how to be rude and surly the hard alcohol prices are a joke seriously please go to total wine plaza rumrunneranywhere but here we live on this side of town but spend the time and gas for better selection prices and service soon total wine will be at park mall cant waiti am a burger lover this place was recommended on msn as a great burger joint they got it wrong  my order was wrong all 8 burgers at our table were welldone the burgers are quite small for the price the fries were cold and the service was mediocre at best i wanted to love it but will never return five star and even 5 guys blow this place awayif there were negative stars id choose that way over pricedi think whole foods is less expensive saturday at 530 pm  probably the worst time to go but we had a gift card and we were in the area  the place was packed and people standing waiting for tables  very noisy and cold  after an initial delay to our food caused by what they said the chef was not happy with the crabcake being burnt  my partner had the crab cake sandwich with fries  she enjoyed it but found the fries to be too salty  i had the broiled scallops and shrimp entree advertised with lump crabmeat and asparagus   well there was no lump crab meat and asparagus  was almost none existent  3 scallops  and 3 shrimp  apparently  the chef is ok with sending no lump crab meat out with a dish but draws the line at over cooked crab cake  staff was apologetic  and gave us a 10 card good on a return visit  not happening  they must be doing something right because the place was packed  maybe we were just unlucky  but our experience was not good hence the 1 star   maybe i would go back just for appetizers  but thats it  go elsewhere with your hard earned dollars  worst experience i have ever had at chipotle the workers working at 1130 at th front have terrible customer service they were out of chicken and didnt even tell me when i told the young girl and i had very little choices of meat my bowl wasnt even that good i ended up getting chorizo waste of my 7 this place only gets 2 star because of the waterthe food took 40 minutes to come when it was super empty in there then it was my sons birthday and the waitresses said they were too busy to sing happy birthday i didnt even ask them my waitress was being friendly and my son told her then she returned and apologized that they were too busy when clearly 80 of the tables were empty my food came out cold and my meat tastes like it wasnt cooked all the way i wish i could give 1 stari stopped here because it looked nice and my friends and i were starving upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away we waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because i had to flag down another server when she walked passed us and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server to greet a table who just walked in our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when i suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said yeah lets just get this all over with at once the burger was disgusting it looked like a mcdonalds hamburger but greasier i just got coffee so i cant say i tasted it but if it had been served to me i would have returned it i had to flag the server down for the check and when i put my card out to be taken everyone else was paying in cash he walked by literally six times without taking the card i ended up just paying cash i have served my entire college career so i understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something i will never understand yes we are tourists just like probably 90 of the restaurant it was sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly this was the first time i have not tipped someone and this is the first time ive written a negative review but i was really that upset about it i made sure to tell all my friends to steer clear of this place when they visiti ordered 30 worth of dinner with a two liter soda  they failed to deliver the soda and when i called they said they were too busy maybe next time there will never be a next time too many other options in this area to put up with that kind of lousy customer servicei liked the place and  food but i cant give more than one star cause the service was terrible they only have one server her name is gabriela she was very rude with my guests and me plus the check came to 180 with 18 tip included and i explained i needed to charge a certain amount in cards and the rest in cash i even wrote the amounts and card numbers on the ticket but after waiting a long time for her to bring the change she didnt bring any change and overcharged the cards a total of 210 dlls instead of 180 she was charging more than 50dlls in tip thats an abuse im very very dissapointed and her only excuse was that she was too busythe owner of popeyes used to send his mother to the drive thru once a week and report irregularities  this bk must be a corporate store because of corporate like employees serving a human population soggy or oil tainted tater tots but everything else is made fresh  that means every customer has to please pull around because they are so fresh they are just coming out of the oven   then they forget caramel in a specialty coffee or a drink that goes with the combo they are holding  breakfast is a disorganized mess  definitely not a place you want to go when you are in a hurry  its a slow food or pull around  wait establishmentwould not recommend to anyone for breakfast  maybe it was due to the mondaysboba was hard and smoothies were overly sweet if youre used to going to good boba places dont bother here very disappointingfirst food poisoning of my life i spent the night in the hospitali would stay clearthe place is impeccably clean and the services was very friendly i was so looking forward to having some good indian food but this place was a big disappointment it says fastfood indian food but it basically was like eating frozen indian food that had been warmed up in the microwave ill keep lookinglacking in service and flavor the waitress went missing for about 20 minutes we waited over 30 minutes to finally order then another 30 minutes for the food to arrive incorrectly my mom is deathly allergic to onions and we asked the waitress numerous times if certain foods were cooked with onions and she said no we dont do that here the only item she advised came with onions were the chicken livers so my mom ordered the smothered pork chops before it even reached the table we could see an onion draped across the chop in the gravy unacceptable my food arrived last which was 20 minutes after the first plate i will not recommended this place to anyonepeople say lightning only strikes once  well guess what  we were a party of six years ago at the old location  they seated us at a huge booth  we sat at that booth for 17 minutes with absolutely no contact with an employee  we walked out  since this new location opened weve dined as a family dozens of times with great results  tonight i entered by myself  seated near the bar at a four top i sat at my table for nine minutesno one nothing  so again i walk out to the prepubescent hostesses thanking me for coming  too much competition cd romasespecially repeating a nasty habit the industry does not forgive you forstopped by the drive thru which moved much slower than whats reasonable then picked up my 7 piece meal was in a bit of a hurry so trusted them to fulfill the order for what i paid for should have know better how in the world can they sack up and order that has items that are standard with every order i have no idea to make matters worse i called since the distance we live its not practical just to jump in the car and go back for the items they screwed up on no one would answer the phone for several minutes after multiple attempts a girl finally answered when i asked to speak with a manager she just hesitated and said ok then she literally put the phone down and i could hear their conversation none of which involved needing a mgr on the phone hung up after a few mins only to call and call to listen to a busy signal the food itself was ok chicken seemed like it had been cooked for awhile and the amount of wasted extra skin made small pieces look huge clearly this location has lost its way but i even filled out a customer survey on the receipt asking to speak with a mgr or gm even the owner never even heard from a line cook so churchs as a whole must have no regard for customer service why even have a survey on the receipt if they had just answered the dang phone that day and addressed the situation i would have possibly returned to get my items they shorted me and it would have been over why would i or anyone want to give them another chance after such abysmal servicenot the best location as far as accessibility and consistence but leaps better than any other santa barbara location i just wish that said something positive all ventura locations taste immensely better   edit chicken was raw not even cooked almost feed it to my toddler after a nasty food poisoning incident at the other sb location i doubt ill return to this one eitherwe bought a groupon for 2 beer flights recently my fiance and i went in and went up to the bartender who was looking at his phone it seemed inconvenient for him to look up when i told him we had the groupon we would like to use he said you look like groupon people without a smile or a joking attitude at all he meant this as an insult im still not sure why we didnt leave right then and there but we will never go back i dont care if their beer is good or not ive never had anyone be so rude to me as a customertwenty five minutes for a jr cheeseburger deluxe and value fry  you go to be kidding me just blew my lunch all to pieceszack at the goleta in n out was very rude he seemed very upset about his job he was taking orders in the parking lot my food was cold and not the in n out i know i will not be visiting goletas in n out any more thanks zack i hope you choose a career you will enjoyavoid the shepherds pie its a complete rip off its 2 pounds of mashed potatoes with a thin layer of meat in the middle i kept having to dig through all the potatoes and never did find much of anything else i was very disappointed i had even asked the waitress about it before i ordered it i mentioned my concern to the waitress but the staff treated me like i shouldve known betteri cant really rate or comment on the food the front counter help seemed nice and courteous  but my big disappointment is how are you going to buy and be part of such a big franchise and still be so damn cheap and not accept american express really dude all because you are to damn cheap to pay the credit card fee really really dudewell this place just lost their awesome review we have been ordering through grub hub and our food was always right and here quickly   after receiving an email from this company letting us know that its cheaper to order from them directly i took that route   an hour after i ordered i called to see where my food was the owner answered and told me that they hadnt started my food yet oops   i told them if they didnt think it would be here within the next 30 minutes to cancel my order they assured us it would be here shortly   my food arrived about 20 minutes later and we began to pass it out i ordered three total bagels and a egg chorizo  and cheese sandwich one bagel was charred burnt and the sandwich was just regular sausage patties   my husband called back to let them know how disappointed we were for ordering food from their site instead of grub hub as they suggested the owner told us that because they were busy inside their website ordering was pushed back   he then explained that our food was incorrect and she told him he was lying why would a grown person call an establishment that they tend to frequent to lie about their service she kept talking over my husband and telling him that we were incorrect for ordering our food the way it was ordered are you kidding me she used the statement im not saying youre lying but your food was made correctly thats literally saying we are lying this drama is not worth it for bagelsi guess if you like natural flavorless smoothies this is the place to go the smoothies didnt taste bad but they just didnt taste good i ended up throwing mine away because i couldnt get by the after taste of every sip which to me tasted liketree or grassi made a reservation online 2 or 3 days prior then the day of i called to confirm  no problem  it was a business dinner with clients i wanted to show them a bit of history of reno and according to yelp good reviews  i would give a zero for the service in particular the 20 something girl at the front  she is useless and if that is the first face you see coming in  forget it  i will never setup another business dinner or lunch there because of this young lady  she argued said there was no reservation rolled her eyes looked bored wasnt helpful and then when all was said and done the reservation was there but she didnt see it  meanwhile the people are piling up at the door    now are they so busy on a week night that they can afford to turn a party of 8 away  are there really no tables available  really  or is the hostess lazy and didnt want to do her job    never going back never going to recommendif there was a zero star rating thats how i would rate this location  it is the worst ice cream ever not sure how the ice cream is mixed but it is not creamy the ice cream is like eating air ewwwwif your interested in spending money on awfulbland and tasteless food this is the place to go service is mediocre at best furthermore this place looks like it was designed by a fourth grade boy with a love for fishing definitely two thumbs way dowclosed  because its not clear from this yelp page i just wanted to point out that the centennial cafe is permanently closedthe food here has become sporadically good at best sad they used to be good  i brought a friend there for dinner tonight as she had liked it and i was unable to talk her into carmelitas in dunedin instead  the tortilla chips served with the salsa were stale not just a little but really stale we laughed how hard is it to serve crisp corn chips apparently its difficult at poblanos  i ordered the chimichangas one steak and one chicken and i asked about the sides the waitress anna explained it comes with mexican rice and a guac salad i said great as i dont like refried beans it came out and i didnt know what it was there were 2 fajitas with cheese sauce on a plate with a guac salad and refried beans  i asked about the beans instead of the rice and the waitress took my plate back to the kitchen where they put my food on another plate with rice  as i started eating it the waitresss asked how it was and i questioned if it was the chimichangas which are fried and i had 2 soft tortillas with cheese sauce like 2 fajitas with cheese sauce exactly like that she took my plate again and went back to the kitchen  when she finally brought it back my date had finished her meal and i was thoroughly disgusted  how hard is it to fry 2 chimichangas and serve them did the cook know what a chimichanga was  they placed my tortillas on a grill and crispened them and brought them back  again i was asked what i thought and i said i was disappointed   no manager or owner came over nothing i ate one   the waitress came back and asked if i wanted to take it home i said yes she handed me a box and walked away  this is a deplorable experience simply pathetic what is she being tipped for  it came out wrong at least twice and nothing was said or done nothing  folks dont waste your time or money here the food stinks the waitress anna is pathetic and management obviously doesnt give a damn either  carmelitas in dunedin is 1000 betterawful awful awful the chef got in a fight with a patron and we waited 45 min and still didnt get food the chef literally threw a tomato at a patron that he was in an argument with over his bulls hat the bathroom had urine on the floor this place isnt even sanitary and should be closed wish i could give it 0 starspretty looking on the outside still amateur on the inside this owner has an inflated ego dont pump your money into inferior product go to la bonne boucher its the real thingterrible service our order got screwed up and once we actually started eating there was a hair in one of our meals another thing that i found odd was that they didnt have any ketchup dispensers they only had packets of ketchup i personally like a lot of ketchup and i had never been to a mcdonalds before that didnt offer ketchup in a pump style dispenser  strange expereince to say the least i wont be returning to this locationwaited 130 minutes for an uber eats delivery and finally had to cancel dont quote 35 min if you cant deliver very disappointingabsolutely horrible experience there was a long wait for the food the server was aloof and uncaring but the worst part of all was due to some technical problem it took nearly an hour to get the check management was completely inept and uncaring the right thing to do in that situation would be to comp the meal but no just a lame apologyno discount no free dessert or drink no compensation at all for the huge inconvenience caused by them and them alone definitely wont be returning to this location they obviously werent ready to open and need a completely new management team who know how to fix mistakes and make things rightok first i have to say that i have no clue about the cost or quality of the food what i do know is that my husband and i were going to try it out for lunch todaywere big fans of diners driveins and dives so we thought wed check it out as we pull into the parking lot  at 230 in the afternoon mind you  we see two girls not grown women girls standing behind one of their cars out in the open in the main lane of the parking lot just feet from the entrance making out this was far more than minor pda it was almost vulgar in a softporn type of style we parked and as we got ready to go in one of the girls was walking in the door although i cant be 100 certain i do assume she works thereshe was carrying a server apron and other items in with her when we tried to call and inform the management we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person im all for love is love but i dont want it shoved in my face when im getting ready to eat we will not be visiting this establishment for this very reasonwe went here and there was maybe one other table eating and our order wasnt taken for 20 minutes we waited for food for 45 more minutes ended up leaving without food manager had an attitudejust ok food  paying 595 for chips and salsa is a bit much most restaurants you get them for free or a lot less food portions were large and service was good i like they had vegetarian and vegan options both times we have gone the place has been empty  if they are 375 then we were overbilled going to have to downgrade to one starthis place is just horrible i have tried this place twice and i will never go back the poatatoes might be the worst ive had borderline unedible and the wait is suprising because of how bad the food is  they all must be there for the first time i cant understand how they get any returning business i have been in the food industry for over 20 years  i live in glenside and would love to have this my go to place but it is just too poor a product as soon as you order they drop your toast  why   when your food finally does come out your toast is cold  just failing grades acrosss the boardi think the workers here are stoned and bone eyed i ordered delivery after almost 2 hours i called and asked about my order at first they said it was on the way the second time i called they said they had no record of my order and could not find it in the system i stupidly ordered again and they never showed up 420 weed is tight i wish i could give a rating lower than zero these guys would get a negative 5nice waiter onion rings and fried calamari was alright but the entrees are tasteless creole catfish is a no no and the ribs are not that good eitherthis place has gone so far downhill its not even funny we ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good i ordered a 35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta  well folks it was disgusting  with a capital d the white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didnt have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever i got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter when i got this 35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns so i cut into it two times thinking maybe i am missing the pink somewhere nope well done and the edges were saw dust sent it back the waitress brings back the same steak smothered in butter  r u kidding me  how do u make a 35 well done steak go back to medium with butter  they r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to maxs time out the food is great and a third of the price i will never go back and i will be telling everyone i know how this place has slipped and is horrible thanks tonys i saved me 35 dollarsordered a chocolate chip cake with buttercream icing and it was terrible the worst cake ever at our first visit to this neighborhood bakery the low quality ingredients and poor substitute for buttercream icing made this cake to visit the trash terrible product and one this bakery had very limited experience in producingi grew up in westmont and have eaten here a few times but the last time was about 2 years ago and for some reason i decided to have the crab cakes i thought they might be freshly made like the menu stated but they didnt look fresh at all in fact it didnt even look like crab really i ate it anyway and hurled later that night wont be going back to the ole westmont diner anytime soonmy wife and i came in for two bowls of ramen the restaurant was nearly empty and had 3 servers and 3 in the kitchen and poke we waited for more than 30 minutes for our ramen and i even checked in with another waitress to make sure our order was correct we watched 2 other tables get served before us and i asked about our food again we got tired of waiting i dont hardly ever do this but we walked out if we had been told how long it would be and given some kind of explanation or offered an appetizer or something we might have stuck around i was excited to try the food the other reviews raved about the ramen but the service and management were lacking we wont be backfirst time eating there and was very disappointed the bbq sauce had no texture what so ever looked like colored water the meat was good would have been better with good bbq sauce the cole slaw was kinda bland and the beans tasted like they were out of a can was also overpriced for what you got  we did have good sevice dont think we will be going backthe soup i got autumn squash was very good but i had planned to get soup and salad the woman said vaguely you get your salad over there after she gave me the soup she said she would ring me up back by the cookies when she got there she started to talk to another customer about milk options for her coffee as she was about to go to the back about the milk she decided to ring me up i wasnt about to wait for the salad so i said i would just get the soup and a drink since this place is basically identical to panera and i have never had poor service at panera i will stick with themhands down the worst service i have ever witnessed waited an hour to even get a drink order an hour in between drink orders and it took an hour and a half to get our food the only reason we stayed was to watch the cardinals game i dont know about you but service is key for repeat business would not recommend this location to even the homeless the one in arnold is like the ritz carlton compared to this  holethe only thing good about this place is the food its amazing that is when you can actually get it which is unfortunate because this place could have incredible potential if the staff was competent   flashback to a month or two ago the weather was about to get bad so the gf and i decided to order some food to go before the storm came in we placed an online order through their website we arrived at the time the site said the food would be ready only to be met with puzzled stares from the staff they had received no online order we showed the cashier the order confirmation and they informed us the online ordering system was having some issues ok fine  fast forward to today about an hour ago the gf and her friend wanted to meet up for brunch so we decided on coming here their menu clearly states that brunch is all day sunday 9am  4 pm we get in line and begin to order brunch when the cashier girl tells us theyre not doing brunch today i told her that was the whole reason we came she replied that they were having some complications  whatever that means strike one  i order a sugarfree vanilla latte my gf who was standing next to me told me they didnt have any before i showed up she ordered a sugarfree vanilla coffee and was told by the girl cashier that they didnt have any sugarfree vanilla syrup when i asked if they did i had ordered this on my first visit the cashier girl asked and magically they had a full bottle of sugarfree vanilla syrup strike two  we then place our food orders i ordered a sandwich with a v in the name its not on their online menu but it is on the menu in the store it has turkey bacon cheese and avocado i pay and then find my seat shortly after ordering the same guy who took my order comes out to our table to tell us they dont have any avocado strike three  if you like to be forced into ordering something you didnt want because what you do want is not being offered that day go here   ive been here twice and both times have been complete failures absolutely abysmal service   the three of us decided we wont be coming backworst mcdonalds in the country one of their employees asked what you want whitebread sorry this place probably has the worst fast food their food just taste pre made frozen the noodle i ordered was very plain and they all stuck together into one giant ball cool concept but the food is just not worth it  you can spend less with much fresher food around the areaive just about had it with this place nothing is good anymore i do not know if it is because new management is taking over in a few months and you have decided to slack but get your sht together the food is so mediocre now skimping portions like no other i pay nearly 13 for an omelette that i swear is smaller than the palm of my hand god forbid you ask for a side of anything you will receive the smallest portion   it isnt just the food that is ridiculous the staff is the worst of all time the little old lady working in the back is the rudest woman i have ever met constantly yelling at her staff for no reason i kindly asked her if the order placed on the counter which had been sitting out for 20 minutes and was cold was mine and she snapped you are slowing me down give me the bloody ticket real nice manners she also prepared my omelette wrong forgetting to add avocado to it i am so sorry you have to serve students that wait for it go to college here and to be honest if you are having trouble serving eggs and avocado toast in a timely manner than all you staff need a wake up call this is not rocket science no one wants to wait 25 minutes for a piece of toast with avocado when we have classes to get to   condescending staff horrible service ridiculous prices  what else could go wrong you say well there is more fun   every single day they will be out of something whether you get here bright and early when they open the kitchen or late at night something is out pastrami forget about it smoked salmon if youre lucky that being said the last time i had the smoked salmon i felt like i was eating fish that had sat out for weeks gross   man i wish i could give zero stars you know what is good though their tea stick to that and nothing else unless you do not want to pay upwards of 4 for a small tea than you know stick to snapplenormally i love everything about feine but i had a really bad experience there today that made me have a change of heart i ordered a classic grilled cheese sandwich which is supposed to contain  you guessed it  just cheese however some of the staff members seemed distracted while they were making it i didnt think anything of it until i got in my car and started chowing down i thought it was odd that the sandwich tasted spicy like reeeeeally hot spicy but i was so hungry so i kept eating half of it then i tasted something funny when i opened up my sandwich i saw turkey now for most people this would not be a big deal but for me ive been a strict vegetarian since i was a kid and meat makes me really sick so it was a big freakin deal made me throw up now im grossed out and sad because i used to love feine but am now really disappointed  they should have been more careful turkey wasnt even on the grilled cheese menu so im really confused as to how it got into my sandwich ughhhlost my business over customer service use to go here regularly and order the same thing every time ordered 8 sandwich but upon going home realized they gave me the wrong sandwich normally not a big deal but thought id take it back to exchange for the correct sandwich upon going back the lady at the counter refused to correct the mistake  in her mind i ordered the 10 because on the ticket that is what she wrote down her attitude was horrible and completely smug the whole time to actually make this a big deal to not fix a sandwich order over a 2 dollar upcharge is absolutely ridiculous especially when i made the effort to drive all the way back then to add her lack of empathy is what really pissed me off enough to write my first review excellent business plan lose customer over a 2 dollar mistakeat first glance this place looks awesomeactually eating here is a whole different story the first thing they really need too decide if they want to be a full service restaurant or an upscale wannabe bread co when the best thing you have is their ice tea i had the salmon tartinewhich would have been called salmon sprinkled cream cheese the cream cheese was at least an inch and a half thick the roasted potatoes were ice cold when we mentioned it they took them back microwaved them came back out half were raw not just mine but my friends also for just ordering from the counter they sure have a lot of staff walking around filling drinkswe were probably asked 5 different times in the course of 10 minutes is everything okay well yes it was ok they really need to figure out if they want to be a full service table restaurant or order at the counter it became very confusing they have actual menus printed out not togo menus as well as monitors with the menu i highly wouldnt recommend this place and will not be back clayton is definitely not the place for this eatery also need to hire cooks that can actually cookoverpriced slow service and food that i can make at home from options at the local walmart i thought grabbing a few beers would help wash down the lack of food taste but unfortunately the brew was like hitting up the local shady discount beer store goodtrytwo words rude and expensive  a friend of mine was setting up a suprise for her boyfriends birthday the cake was supposed to be delivered today at 1215pm however the surpise ended up being no cake and a rude cashier  i walked to the store and asked where the cake was since it was 30 minutes past the time it was to be delivered and was told  i dont why she said it would be delivered im the only one here and obviously cant leave if they were unable to deliver the cake they should have voiced this prior to the day of   there are so many other healthy frozen treat options around walnut street that are less expensive do not waste your money  last but not least the cake tasted frost bitten yuckthey lie about how long orders will take big time i have never met more incompetentinconsiderate staff in my lifedont eat here the kitchen is disgusting the staff is unfriendly  the food isnt good this restaurant needs a serious deep cleaningi read about this restaurant in the sauce magazine and thought it would be a good spot to dine i was disappointed in the seatingfood and price   for the price i would think you would have a waiter or waitress food was average portions where ridiculously small 2 deviled eggs for 6geesh  im not sure if the cook knows what the original recipes looked like before he prepared it but h has to do some research    i had the catfish sweet potatoes and pork cracklings cornbread catfish was average and small portions sweet potatoes where bland and the cornbread had no pork cracklings in it google it when you get a chance   overall i didnt enjoy itif i could give hungry howies a zero i would their employees are always too high to function they have a hard time remembering orders and constantly leave things either at the store or in their car i ordered from hungry howies on pantano last night it literally took an hour for the food to get here and then he forgot the drinks and the garlic sauce he had to go back to the store to get it which literally took about 15 to 20 minutes so by the time our drinks got here we were already done eating and another thing do not use their split technique online i split my payment between my debit card and cash and it put it all on my debit card the delivery driver didnt even have me sign the receipt so i didnt realize that it was paid in full until i looked at my receipt i literally complained about the service and this delivery driver thought that i gave him a 13 tip didnt even say anything i go in today to get my 10 back because i only meant for him to have a 3 tip because his service sucked and theyre only excuse was im sorry hes new so you dont train your new guys to have the customers sign the receipt when they use a card because if he had this whole ordeal would have been avoided never order delivery from hungry howies on pantanohorrible service old stale slices kept in cake display with a lid that drips evaporation on the slices unsanitary and not worth the tripwhy does it say online open 247 everyday but there always saying the store is closed at night even the drive thru is closed 3 days a week at night also the staff is ignorant blackownedbusinessesall the food options in d terminal are horrifically bad this is not much better than the rest  i got to the terminal a little before 5am and nothing was open not even a coffee stand this was the first place to open so i went for a sausage egg and cheese bagel and  a cup of coffee for a stupid 11 and change   the bagels had so much grease on it i had to take the whole thing apart and pat it down  it was vile never eat here if you value your stomachnot gluten free even though it comes up on the gluten free site  i ordered 3 egg whites and one whole egg scrambled with spinach they got that wrong the first time  second time they got it right but the microwave their eggs  runny on the outside and rubbery as a hockey puckreally bad  this place was great years ago but is on an extreme descent  it took close to a half hour to get a few average tacos  the chips were bland and the verde salsa tasted sour  the staff in the back were yelling and fighting  probably time to close shop and let someone put this valuable location to good usenot a good experience at all service was poor our server thought it was cute to sit down at the table while taking orders and gave a real putout vibe at the end of the evening when our table of 6 didnt clear out immediately after paying the bill strike 1 everyone agreed that the food while not inedible was nothing to write home about i had salmon with lump crab portion of salmon was overcooked and the crab was not lump im from md i know lump crab meat the hollandaise was greasy and the rice tasted like seasoned uncle bens also oneperson in our group is on a very rigid diet and requested that the crispy wontons be omitted from her salad the server was insistent that she include them and despite several polite refusals the wontons were still sent out on the side folks that was just weird and inconsiderate to our fellow dinerstrike 2  im a beer drinker and enjoy craft offerings from microbreweries i tried the ipa okay but not balancedbitter and over hoppy and a lager beer flavored water is what i thought on my first sip strike 3 so overall i felt granite city was lame wouldnt recommend it and definitely wont return willingevery single day i go hoping that the food wont taste staleeveryday im disappointed horrible food and ive been to many other dunkin dounts and by far the worst tasting food hands downthe place looked interesting enough the live music was pleasant enough the food and drink were over priced and marginal at best but the coupe de grace was delivered when i received the check i had asked for an additional portion of herbed mayonaise that accompanied my cuban sandwich upon examination of the check i found a 1 charge for a table spoon of mayo unbeliebvable i said something to the manager who did nothing but say thats how it is dont be lured by the interesting exteriorthis place is not worth your time or money and the management is completely tone deaf on customer perception of value 8 for a 10oz glass of common ipa 18 for lack luster fish tacos plus mayo for 1 there are much better options in that town or accross the riverdoesnt taste anything like it used to the meat taste awful he fries are less thick and taste like cardboard really was the best fast food burger 17 years agoi remember when this place was new and fresh it was worth the trip from germantown  now the quality of this place is akin to an expensive pathmark  oh how the mighty have fallen  ive been disappointed with this place for a while  but the kicker came when i came for a simple caesar salad  all i wanted from the salad bar was  romaine onion dressing  3 simple ingredients what i realized as i stood there amazed there wasnt romaine was that theyve mistaken fancy for quality  a salad bar with only spinach and mesclun no iceberg or romainewhy and the spinach and mesclun looked a little wilted anyway so it wasnt even appealing   so trying to salvage my trip here i peruse the rest of the bar  its totally mediterranean influenced  meaningi hate it i dont like feta i dont like stuffed olives i dont like dolmades i have to be in a mood for hummus and its damn sure not coming from a buffet so im totally underwhelmed and since my desired salad base is inexplicably missing i cant just make a salad  i go to look at the sushiwhy i havent a clue i know its gross but the allure of the asian man cleaning the knives as if hes just freshly made all of those containers of sushi gets me  i look and then gag on the price    im starving though and have just had an incident involving the cops funny story so i just want to sit and eat something i finally buy just a simple macaroni salad from the deli and get water   i sit down come to yelp and find the sushi restaurant 2 blocks down get up and leave  i dont think ill bother stopping here againi clearly ordered unsweetened iced tea they came out with sweet tea i just noticed in the reviews that they did the same exact same thing to another customer  anyway when i pointed out the mistake my server said she could not take back or refund the drink  my only recourse was to order and pay for a new drink so i placed the order waited 10 minutes but it never came i pushed the call button but i was ignored for five more minutes i finally gave up and drove away without the drink i wanted i ended up paying full price for a drink that was poured into the bushes  i headed over to mcdonalds and got exactly what i wanted for half the price  i will not be going to sonic againwow i just had one of the worst experiences at bareburger we live very close but have frequented shake shack which is a bit of a walk my husband suggested we try bareburger tonight because its close and thought it might be nice we went with some friends and could not have had a worse experience first and last time when we arrived they said that they had a busy weekend and were out of a few things hostess said fries sweet potatoes and onion rings but they had plenty of other things when we were seated and were about to order the waitress informed us they were out of about 20 things fries sweet potato fries onion rings sprout rolls bison beers vanilla and chocolate ice cream  we came with kids    and the list went on everything we ordered they did not have then as we are eating we see orders of onion rings pass us and then sweet potato fries when asked about it they said they ordered prior they were not even seated when we ordered clearly not possible it was an absolute s show and the level professionalism was a 1 at best for honesty and handling a challenging situation sad because we probably would have gone often terrible experience had nothing to do with the items they were out of and everything to do with the way in which it was handlednot how you expect a business to be ran un professional on so many levels just open your eyes and pay attention food is great the cooks are just way to in consistent on cooking and presentation for the price you have to pay will never return backstood in line 2nd in line for 20 minutes one guy in front of me waiting on the cashier  the cashier was just standing there smiling taking the sweetest time ever possible i could have gotten to a log john silvers in texas before he pressed a button on the register the food was poorly made thrown on a plate and served after another 20 minutes of waiting i could have went to the gulf and caught my own fish to filet them myself quicker than they threw  this fast food together fish wasnt the same as the ljs in goodlettsville before it shut down the one in goodlettsville was the best one ever there should be more of the around captain ds is a joke compared to ljsextremely disappointing experience upon entering i asked one of the store workers about their recommended pastry appearing extremely confused he had no idea what to recommend and left me to make my own decision after selecting my various items on my own i was presented with a total of about 1350 in pulling out my credit card the same cashier let me know that they have a 15 minimum for all purchases his suggestions were either to used the atm with high fees behind me or to buy something additional  i asked him where the minimum was posted  he responded that it wasnt i promptly asked for my credit card abandoned my purchase and leftthe service is fine and the place is clean enough but none of that matters because the two most important factors are missing good price and good taste  im used to wetzels pretzels which i already thought was expensive at 349 tax  a pretzel however wetzles tastes amazing so i give it a pass   but this place takes the cake in terrible costing and tasting pretzels i think i have paid less for a pretzel at disneyland and probably have had dog food that was richer in taste why am i eating dog food none of your business maybe i just like to know what it tastes like so i can write accurate reviews about poor taste ok   ok so i bought this pretzel anyway because i had a bogo coupon but it so wasnt worth it even if the pretzel had been 1 i wouldnt return this pretzel was stale stiff and overly chewy like a steak that was a crappy piece of meat to begin with and then got overcooked it tastes like they made it no sooner than yesterday and it was thin yet not that crispy   absolutely hated this pretzel and i cant believe i was suckered into such a travesty by a stupid coupon from tmobile thats right tmobile im bringing you into this too please dont ever pair up with this place againbad experience owner is a bully and does not support the customer food substandard at best do not waste your time or money expect nothing but excuses and belittling from the owner and staff take a look at his responses in here and think twice before dining herei cant give it less first there were four tables full and we made the fifth the girls just stood there and looked at us finally one came ive and took our drink order we said we were ready to order that we had been sitting there no sorry i ordered some wings very good just that they did not come out until my meal my wife got shrimp that were cold should have been hot i got a two meat dinner with two sides dirty rice and baked beans mine was bland no flavor at all then no rice they dont have it anymore and they just didnt bother to tell me no replacement we sat and waited for over forty minutes waiting for our cold food in the time we were there we heard four tables complain about one thing or another will not be backif i could give negative zero stars i would i came here tonight and it was gross i normally love taco bell but this was pathetic soggy tacos no ice in my drink no sauces the drive thru member almost gave me another customers order my cheese wasnt melted in my cheesy roll up rude service as well i will not be returning this is by far the worst experience ive had with hardees at this location i ordered three burgers and a large curly fry when i got my order the fries were cold burnt and was filled halfway im not all about getting every last bite but if i ordered a large order of fries please give me a large order of fries the burgers were cold and those new pretzel buns were horrible and hard they were dry and the bottom bun wasnt a full bottom bun never coming black againafter having been to more than 65 hard rock locations worldwide i must say that this place stinks no literally the cigarette smoke from the casino just pours into this hrc  the option to exit and walk through the cold air alllll the way around the building to your car probably parked i their parking garage is not an option after enduring the stinky walk into the cafe you dine and then are forced to return through the stink back to your car  i stood outside for a bit to allow my clothing to breathe something you cant do once inside but that didnt work  after driving an hour back home i showered and did laundry  the next day when i stepped back into my car  i was hit with a reminder that i had been to the hrc tampa  if you are a fan of ebay and have ever bought any clothing one of the things you will see on auction descriptions is from a smokefree home  well if i were to purchase a hard rock shirt or dare i say leather bomber jacket quite pricey you know well even though my hojme is smokefree the jacket would not be just based on having been subjected to the casino chimney heads  as far as dining goes this location has the enjoyable menu that other cafes have plus the not so enjoyable second hand smoke the merchandise shop has all the trinkets bells  whistles that has put hrc on the map since june 14 1971 when the first cafe opened in london as long as your purchase selection is an item you dont mind washingrinsing off first in order to have it the way the manufacturer intended    my dining experience  it was a bad one but like at every hrc management did everything to make sure we left happy  kudos to the manager  what did they do or not do after waitign a very long time for our meal on a not so busy night they brought out the wrong food well my fiancees order was flawless but who wants to eat alone and then have the other person eat alone later when the right order comes out  the waiter made the offer to correct my food which we waited a long time for again but made no offer to have both meals come out at the same time  the manager removed her meal and sent out an appetizer as well as free dessert vouchers since we had no room for the dessert that night  the next time i feel like driving an hour through psycho area traffic in order to plant myself in a smoky environment to simply partake in a dessert we will use the vouchers ummm no   two thumbs downholy skimpy crabs batman  this is my first review and felt compelled to write about my dismay at this socalled crab eatery  ordered 3   jumbos  and was met instead with 3 pipsqueak blue crabs it may not be crab season in the region but i thought i read in another review that they fly in their crabs from other parts of the us  not so it seems  i was sadly disappointed and will keep my crab adventures to md and dc where they belongi went recently to the lakeview location and ordered the chicken quesadilla as i was eating i noticed that there was not much chicken between the two layers of tortilla i peeled apart the two layers to see how much chicken was not there and there was a piece of red plastic in the midst of the cheese the red plastic seemed to be the plastics that tie off bread packages i was offered no compensation for my meal and there was an obvious lack of sincereity in the waitressess apology i have been a big chateau costumer and have been for years i was very disappointed in the services herei have to say that im very disappointed with this place i used to come here back in the day and the quality of the food was way better than what it is now i dont know what happened to this place but its not the same anymore service was great and thats only highlight of the night i order the lobster pasta super bland no flavor whatsoever will be coming back here anymorei didnt see this walking into the restaurant because someone was holding the door for me but there is a sign that says no outside drinks i brought in my own coffee because i was just diagnosed with prediabetes and in an effort to control it i am not allowed to have regular half and half or milk with my coffee i have to have heavy whipping cream in place because i cant drink my coffee black as soon as we sat down our waitress came over and said that because of a health hazard she had to take my coffee and give it back to me when we left i explained to her why i brought it with me and she offered me milk or cream cant have it i was pissed im pretty sure this is just a ploy to make you buy coffee from them which probably has a huge profit margin the food is nothing special but because of my coffee incident we will never come here again first of all i dont know how this is a hazard to anyones health and second of all i doubt theyd take a bottle away from a hungry babywas excited to try this place as the reviews look good and ive heard great things from friends unfortunately on saturday november 7 2015 they were closed for the season already i dont know of one other frozen custard place in stl thats already closed plus the yelp page says open frustratingterrible service came here with my girlfriend after receiving an ad for their new strawberry smoothies and drinks the guy taking our order josh i think it was is a total failure he was impatient with us as we decided what to order misheard my order got rude and impatient when we asked him to repeat something he said that was incomprehensible and was extremely unhelpful we ended up not getting smoothies because they didnt have any yogurt for making smoothies what then we tried to order one of the new strawberry drinks instead nope that ones not out yet tried to order a regular drink from the menu too nope seriously how you gonna distribute tons of ads for smoothies and drinks and plaster your entire store with signs about happy hour half off drinks when you dont even have any they cant make drinks fresh and their drink fridge was pitifully stocked get your act togetherarrived at 922pm to a sign that read closed earlysorry management during all star weekendmardi gras terrible an employee came to the door and said we ran out of dough and we didnt make anymore smhso if you plan on going here please call aheadrude rude rude hung up on me on the phone twice when i was asking about wait time food cant be their redeeming quality if you never get that farone worddisappointed i was very surprised at the lack of quality of the food for the price taco bell produces the same for a much lower price  for the price of a casual lunch i expected much more  while we dined there were 10 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned bathrooms were very dirty girlfriend had to hover  we would have loved to sit in a booth but none were available and clean filthy rotten just a very disappointing experience staff consisted of two overworked hurried young girls who did their best disappointingim convinced that the people that work here just make whatever they think you should drink rather than what you actually order i especially love when one certain condescending employee informs me that skim milk beverages do not come with whip after requesting no whip oh but it doeseverysingletime the other day i ordered 3 items and every single item was either made incorrectly or completely the wrong thing  also the drive thruso slow glacial eveni routinely wait for the bus on idaho st and have thought of stopping here for a bite but never have had the time  after what i witnessed today i never will  i was told it was the owner who did this but who knows  whoever it was should be fired  if it was the owner he should be put out of business  as i was waiting for the bus the owner came out of the restaurant and started verbally abusing and harassing a man waiting for the bus  he kept insulting the man by telling him that he would be taking the bus for the rest of his life and would never amount to anything  i take offense to this as should any of us who need to take valley ride to get to our destinations  mr moons kitchen you will never serve me  i hope all of boise sees this and you never serve any of them again either  you are completely unprofessional and undeserving of the business from the good people of boisemy complaint revolves around 1 thing no red cream soda i can only assume the owner is trying to cut a corner and pay less for cheaper strawberry fanta which has been immediately offered to me every time i ask for red cream soda ive been a few times now and its clear that even though they have barqs red cream soda on their sign they dont get it for their customers anymore this has literally been a staple item for me when i do decide to go to white castle ive made the decision this is my last time going to this white castle or any other unless they have barqs cream sodathere was no soy sauce in my order barely any ponzu sauce and the tuna and salmon were sliced in correctly im very disappointed how can you slice fish into large cubes never ordering from here again the tuna is brown the jalapeos are not fresh i would like a full on refundslow service under par food overpriced asian goods cashier seems more busy organizing deliveries than serving customers in the store not impressed at alltheir drivethru is so slow it hurts i recommend bringing food from the wendys next door because by the time you get your food youll be hungry againwith all of the great restaurants in nola there is no need to stop at this one  the crab cake napoleon was one small crab cake with a slice of eggplant on the top and bottom the crab cake sandwich was covered in a thin sauce that had the precut picksweet oniongreen pepper in itnot good  that was a 15 entreno side no nothing  pass on by this onekameron just helped us tonight and he was rude and disrespectful to us they got our order wrong when i ordered a ham and cheese sandwich but they put turkey so we pointed it out to him and he argued with us saying he read back the order to us but he didnt and didnt bother asking if there was anything else we would like to order when we wanted to add items to our order when he gave the sandwich back to the girl making the food instead of remaking the sandwich we watched her just take the turkey off and put ham and cheese on the original sandwich she had made i wont be coming back to this location because of the service we just revived i will also be filing a formal complaint with corporate regarding the disrespect we recived i have been in customer service for a very long time and would be fired on the spot if treated any clients the way we were treated tonighti ordered the meal deal with his six nuggets and fries and bbq sauce and a large  sweet receive my order and i touch my fries and they was cold is be young guy in the window to your have any hot fries so i gave him my the cold fries and he hollered back to the person that was cooking they said yes we have hot fries so he went back to get them and when he was walking to the window he just hand me the hot fries in this hands he should have put them in a bag or wrapped a napkin around them so i got another order of friesvery poor service we ask for few extra things on our pizza and they forget and cook half way they r doing again hoping this time come goodi try to taste boba drinks every where i go because im a boba enthusiast so when i saw that there was a boba place by the movie theaters i was going to i was a little hesitant but was down to try it   going into the store the girls where on their phone laughing and didnt even greet us for 5 minutes straight until we went up and started ordering   i got a jasmine green milktea while my friends got a matcha milk tea when my friends got their drinks the matcha green milk tea was a different green it was like a candy apple green and the taste was even worse it had no matcha flavor at all just tasted like straight up candy it was so sweet but the boba was chewy so thats at least the only good thing   the jasmine milk tea was already pre made and had a slight taste of jasmine but also straight up sugar all in all i dont think ill ever come back to this place and you shouldnt eitherwe made a reservation to go here with our children on sunday evening solely based on the high yelp rating disappointing is an understatement the 1315 price for three bites of pasta is absolutely ridiculous they stated that they were meant for tasting in that case either lower the price or provide a somewhat larger portion we were flabbergasted the food overall had a good flavor but was consistently over saltedthe waitress was friendly but mostly stood over by the kitchen and chatted with her cohorts getting her to get us a check or for more water was impossible definitely not going here againthe food tastes like it was seasoned with water and the turkey may as well have been jerky the food was well below subpar i know this is a local hot spot but i cannot figure out why  i usually dont mind waiting for excellent food and service but never again will i wait 30 mins in the rain for pancake pantry do yourself a favor and skip it especially if youre price conscious outrageously priced for the meager offeringsepic fail  15 minutes after we ordered we received the smallest 13 dollar cheesesteak i could even imagine  13 dollars you say  oh yes they charge a dollar for exactly 3 pieces of long hots and two dollars for sharp provalone  and their traditional size is so cute and little  like it is a kid size   now mind you we are tony luke oregon ave customers  we go there instead of pats and genos   this sandwich went in the trash  it was greasy  the meat was cooked weird  it was stacked weird  the onions were disgusting  now this was at 7pm not 130 am   clearly the grill was not hot enough and the cooks were not good enough or didnt care enough to fix it  the roll was bad  i cant believe my wife and i had to toss this in the trash and look for other food  but we did the worst part ok the sandwich was the worst part  but the next worst part  we talked to the manager  he apologized and said he would keep an eye on the guys on the grill  but didnt offer us a redone sandwich or a refund or anything  he saw us throw it in the trash and did not make it right tony  we have talked to you at your stand in south philly and the restaurant across the street  if this is what you think of south jersey stay on your side of the river  i can get a sandwich like this for a couple dollars at wawaplaced a phone order for pick up jeffersons burger this is the sad looking item i found when i got back to my office no cheese two strips and barely a squirt menu clearly states this item should come wamerican cheese and i did not opt out temp was lukewarm at best  extremely disappointed attached image to backup my reviewpizzatoo small too much had better way better especially for the  like wood fired pizza but not into cremated crustthe absolute worst service ever which is so sad because the food really is delicious but the service is seriously soooo bad it overshadows how good the food is its almost comical how awful the service is at the exton location almost like if it wasnt actually as bad as it it  they should be awarded for their consistently beyondterrible service weve been to the royersford location also service and food are better there as long as you dont mind the occasional cockroachthis location consistently puts a daily menu online that is wrong  it is extremely frustrating to make a trip out of my way for food they say they offer only to arrive and have them tell me i must be wrong and looked at the wrong location when i have showed a worker the menu on my phone with their location and the date they just shrug and look at you blank mcl please hire someone who can correctly type up a daily menu and cooks who can follow said menuwhen i went to eat here they were cleaning the ceiling fans right over where the food was being preparedworst ever customer experience omi gosh the fudge looked delicious and the pralines looked good and we wanted to try a piece we were in line for over 15 minutes and i think which we should have just left like some others we were being patient and thinking is kind of just the vibe the woman who seemed like the manager running the register was so unprofessional it was almost a joke she was talking with fellow employees and friends walking by more than servicing customers in front of us which was only one couple mind you when we finally got up to the front shes talking again to a friend and giving her money in front of us and then finally asks what wed like by barely speaking to us and then proceeds to completely disregard us to speak again to a friend walking by we left obviously so i cant comment on the fudge unfortunatelyin no universe should enchiladas cost 25 and tacos 18 who makes a chile relleno with goat cheese and raisins raisins this can not be considered mexican food  i have money to burn but that doesnt mean im going to just give it to you and get price gauged came in here for dinner with the family but upon looking at the menu we decided to pay for our margaritas and dip the margaritas were ok but not for 12 no wonder the place wasnt busyservice was terribly slow canceled our order for waters and soda and an appetizer and walked out staff has a long way to go management doesnt seem to be overly involvedwaited several minutes waiting to order i was the only car waiting an employee saw pull out didnt say anything been to this sonics several times slow service every timeordered a chicken gyro a beef gyro and grape leaves  it took an hour and a half to arrive  i live 09 miles away from smileys cafe    my boyfriend was handed a sopping wet brown bag of what was assumed to contain a charming dinner for 2 straight from the balkan tip but could have been mistaken for a bums malt liquor koozie  this meal forced me to review the definition of gyro  ie a gyro iro or gyros irosnote 1 greek  gyros literally turn is a greek dish made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie  the meat in the gyros was bland dry cold and quite obviously not cooked on a spit  the chicken tasted and looked like it was boiled in water  the beef had noticeable bits of synthesized mediterranean flavor but ultimately dry downcast overworked and underpaid  sloppily assembled  i drenched sriracha and mayo on everything to find my stomachs way to salvation  grape leaves were fine though i was resentful of them due to their little olive oil orgy they decided to have all over everything  shit happens i get it  i guess i just want the restaurantdelivery driver to at least feign recognition by saying yo that took a long time  sorry my man or ay got a nondescript liquid peeking out your bag  my b  complete lack of acknowledgement or a whisper of an apology just kills meadmittance ive been pampered with bubble tea lived in china 5 years and ive tried everything from really cheap massproduced bottled milk tea up to some high end stuff ive never disliked a milk tea and im not picky i swear but this is just too much  this is the worst milk tea ive ever had  the tea is watery and flavorless the pearls are severely overcooked to the point of being gelatinous blobs instead of chewy delicious bobba they were roughly the consistency id expect out of snot i honestly didnt know milk tea could be bad until this place  bings bobba tea should feel incredibly blessed that its the only place around selling fresh milk tea this milk tea could never stand up to competition i just get cheaper more delicious bottled milk tea from lee lees supermarket  in short its bad and you should avoid itin sum the food is terrible and the service is attentive  ive eaten here twice now the first time i ordered the combination pho and it was fine it seemed to be missing an ingredient that i couldnt put my finger on but the broth was clearer than that of my goto spot noodle city the fresh spring rolls were solid  on my second visit my meal was inedible i ordered the grilled chicken bn and theres no way this meat was merely grilled it was probably cooked before and microwaved at some point and it had  weird texture the chicken was in huge chunks it badly needed seasoning and the chunks were extremely dry and tough the rest of the bn was a ton of vermicelli noodles though not exactly the right kind some shredded iceberg lettuce a little bit of shredded cucumber and some bland pickled carrot and radish no punch to that pickle overall the dish had no flavor even after dumping the fish sauce over it and the meat was downright disgusting  my wifes pho ga was not as good as the pho tai she ordered the time before the broth was cloudy and had a thick layer of grease on top that needed to be skimmed the chicken was horribly dry after being boiled for who knows how long it still seemed to be missing some ingredient that neither of us could identify  im not eating here againif it wasnt bad enough that the hard rock just increased their menu prices but now you must pay 10 just to park where you want to just have dinner or gamble as if they arent making enough money   sorry we will not be going backim a loyalty member and had a birthday free pretzel coming  i went to this location an hour before closing and was advised that the deal was only good on original pretzels and they didnt have any indicating the display case of what they had left  some reward  ill take my business to a different auntie annesextremely overpriced also the entire store is ran by high school aged children that have no work ethic the employees are hard to find when you are ready to be checked out and constantly on their phones it appears that this place has no structure at all also tiffany is extremely rudeeveryone talks about eegees so we saw one and popped in the sandwiches were meh the ice was meh the place was dirty and the staff was not friendly i wouldnt stop at this eegees or another one ever againwe went here for breakfast and will never return this restaurant is filthy floors walls windows right down to the silverware with dried food on it to our mugs and glasses the ceiling tiles stained it needs to close down and be totally renovated before serving the public our breakfast came out cold and we couldnt eat it we saw the waitresses touching the food and plating it with their hands where is the board of health never will we ever returnits closed health department violations  does not look like its going to reopen gonegoodbyeare you kidding me  wanted to get seafood as a treat and saw this awesome deal on groupon with lobster haven located on hillsborough avenue in tampa went in with a 47 saving on 79 worth of seafood didnt mind the higher than average prices on their stuff cause we felt we got a great deal with groupon then we walked in only to be taken by surprise by the terrible selection of groupon customers only freezer instead of getting to choose from items like shrimp crabs steamers oysters lobster clams or any fresh fish the 3 foot by 5 foot freezer contained  frozen coconut shrimp cheap  freezer burnt swai bags of 3 stuffed clams and a couple of lobster pot pies  that by the way were offered to us for free if we decided to take any of this garbage off their hands disgusting  only good news we got was when we went back to the car groupon let us cancel the 39 purchase immediately  bottom line  groupon your the shit lobster haven  well you kinda are tooi always visit the cow and the curd at night market and after my recent venture i probably wont be going back  the quality has really gone down hill since my first ever bucket of curds  i was really looking forward to the delicious squeakiness of the white curds but all i got was what seemed like melted cheddar or velveeta cheese  not sure what happened here but you may want to rethink the product you are selling and get back to your rootscame in to the bar on a not  too  busy night and was ignored for at least a good 2025 minutes very disappointed because i had heard good things about the place but i couldnt even get a drink both bartenders continuously walked right past me several times and even looked right in my direction and never acknowledged mewaited for over 15 min for an aa bowl the orders kept getting mixed up 4 ppl got the wrong thingwhy oh why do i keep stopping here  because it is almost  literally the only place around here    it doesnt matter if i go through the drive up or go in   there is usually a line  this mcdonalds is in for big trouble if another business ever comes out here    today we went inside because being the 4th of july the queen donuts was closed  we just wanted a quick breakfast   the food is standard mcdonalds fare usually the iced coffee is what i stop for  it can be really good  today they put so much vanilla in it  it was white  a bit  too sweet today  please note that fast food is not fast at this mcdonalds   i dont even know why  there were 8 people working that i could see  maybe there is a more efficient way they could do things  seems like 8 would be enoughbut i have never worked in a restaurant  so i dont know if 8 is enough  it gets 1 star for being here when you are desperatefrom the moment we walked in we were treated horribly the servers never made eye contact with us to ask us if we wanted to be seated we had to search for them when we finally found one we told them we were going to eat in the back there were no tables available so we came back up front the manager came out and asked if wed been helped we said no because we were going in the back but no tables we asked for a table up front  she said she couldnt seat us because they were serving dinner only up there  forced a group of 5 of us to sit at a small 4 corner table fyi they were empty up front maybe 3 tables were full she didnt ask if we were going to eat she just told us no our waitress was no better she told us the 5th chair better not get in her way she gave us 2 menus to share  was annoyed we didnt have our order ready because we werent regulars we put in drink orders  appetizers around 715 the drinks came immediately around 755 we still had no food we asked our server  she said she forgot our 5th person arrived at 815  the food still wasnt there we went  told the manager weve been waiting for over 40 minutes for appetizers  we will be sitting in the main area to hear each other we ordered two rounds of apps  2 members ordered food they comped one round of apps but never once apologized or offered anything else needless to say we wont be backone of them has been salty to much the other dish had a hair on the plate the manager in the restaurant didnt know what to do so the bottom line we had a bad experienceso i called before friday night rush to order for delivery since i live 5 minutes from them and they sent me a flier  i place my order after i place my order and she runs my card she says i will be an hour  i said wxcise me  she said well  i can try and cancel it but it is to late now   then she tries to argue that it is friday and that is why it will take so long  i pointed out their flier offers free fast delivery and why didnt o go to pizza hut  she said they are better quality  well we will seei love chipotle but this location is just terrible ive gone a few times hoping maybe it was just a fluke  overall the food at this location is poor quality and doesnt taste as good as others  staff is very friendly howeverwill not go back i had high hopes a friend recommended it and husband had had lunch here a few times but this was not a great experience our waitress was flakey drinks mixed up and delivered to the wrong table got guacamole and no chips sons chicken fingers had and odd taste like fried in old oil and too much flour other son ordered mixtos steak pork and chorizo skillet tacos and  now had an upset stomach i had the shrimp and crab bake and it tastes like fake crab and too much cheese overall disappointed and underwhelmed but my jalapeo margarita was goodterrible convenience store the only good thing about this gas station is where it is located even so i will definitely not be returning to this place every time ive gone in there the employees are nothing but rude and not at all helpful i went in there twice in one day and both of the interactions i had with the two different cashiers just left me appalled the first time i went up and asked for one thing behind the counter and the cashier said what so i asked nicely again and she still said what and after asking her for the second time she then pulls out a headphone from her ear so i can ask a third time then i had another encounter later that evening where the male cashier told me not to get smart with him when i simply asked a valid question about purchasing some ranch there are just not any nice personable people working in there so if you stop here id just get gas outside so you dont have to go in and talk to any of their shitty employeesmy family has been coming here for years and always loved it but we had such a bad experience yesterday i doubt we will be back in awhile  we had to sit on the patio because it was so busy there was a festival going on but it was cool the fans were on and its covered so we didnt mind  our waiter was very good and food was good  service a little slow  however toward the end of the meal a lady right outside the patio decided to stop stand there and smoke a cigarette for a good 10 minutes blowing her smoke all over my entire family including my 10 year old son it was his birthday my older son who has an autoimmune condition myself who has severe allergies and asthma and other patrons including another young child  when i asked the waiter if she could be made to leave florida clean air act his reply was no the ashtray is there  so either hellas provides a smoking area right next to their dining area disgusting and unhealthy or the city of tarpon springs does and they do nothing to have it moved  i was sneezing all night and diagnosed with a sinus infection today  i left without visiting the bakery and doubt i will be back for a long time  beyond disappointedworst pizza ever my children and i physically got sick from this pizza  it is nothing like macks or mack n manco down the shore  disgustingbad experience there hostess sat us quickly which was nice but went downhill from there service was so so the waiter seemed too busy our food was all served cold the fish on my plate was hot but the sides were all lukewarm over salted also the beer was interesting and the only reason worth coming i wouldnt waste your money on foodyou get to wait 20 minutes even when first in line at the drive thru window now worth it  even of their fries are dieworthymy family shared a cookie sundae a large cookie with a large scoop of ice cream with fudge and whipped cream the ive cream was ok the cookie wasnt very good and the fudge was awful not sure if it had burned or what but the taste was completely off  we appreciate the homemade aspect of the business and like supporting smaller venue vs chains but this was a fail not to mention that the person working there  the owner  could use a dose of friendlinessline was waaaaaay too long  donut was huge  got the new orleans cream donut  was not told that there would be rum flavoring in it  who knew or thought to ask  got the chocolate milk  very unimpressed with it  ive made better with hershey chocolate milk mix    will be a long time before i go back if everhorrible experience today its was an hour and a half way for the hayride thats on top of waiting just to buy the tickets went to terhune in princeton and it was awesome free hayride tons of apples just as crowded but much more organized   the worst was i posted on fb about it and johnsons deleted my postgreat product but horrible customer service online  i live in new orleans and brought my mother some pralines once on a trip home back to maine  she loved them and i started sending her boxes of pralines for christmas her birthday even mothers day  the customer service in the actual southern candymakers stores on decatur street is awesome  over christmas the stores were busy so i ordered them off the website to be sent to her  i sent her a 3 pound box and she was so excited  she told me last week she needed more so i went on the website again and ordered her a 4 pound box  i placed the order on 114 and paid 30 extra for 2 day shipping via fex ex  the order wasnt even sent out until the 16th and when she finally got them today they were peanut butter flavored which she does not like  when i ordered it said you must choose a flavor  original was the first choice and thats what i checked off  i called customer service and the woman that i dealt with linda should not be working with people  she basically accused me of lying saying there was no way that there could be a computer error when i ordered even though the order info also said my mother lived in gorham mississippi instead of maine and my old phone number was on the order which i had corrected  i told her that ive been getting pralines from them for years and spending at least 100 every time  she finally said if my mother sent them back paying shipping out of her own pocket they would send her the original  i am so upset after being a loyal customer for 5 years that they i would be treated so poorly  i guess i will have to find another company to spend 300500year onwhich is too bad because up until today i would have stayed a loyal customer and always highly recommended themfood was cold and the ice carmel mocha was just coffee with ice not to mention they shorted me 2 dollars in change the worst mc ds ive been tothis mcdonalds is by far the worst one ive ever encountered i ordered two apple pies and noticed that the use by date wasnt anywhere near todays date 3416 and when i said something to the employees about it the answer was someone must have printed the dates wrong all the apple pies have that date and i was wrong and disrespected i felt so degraded by the people who work for this establishment i will never go there again id rather drive across the bridge and pay the toll to go to philadelphia and order from another mcdonalds then ever go to this location again i hope they retrain the employees who work there and they want 1500 an houri dont know can i leave a 1 star rating seriously id love to   i simply do not understand how the chain hires really how do they hire a person for the meat department that can not cut meat or a person for the fish department that has no clue how to filet a fish  we were there a few days ago and i noticed that they had red spapper didnt like that they were headless because you really cant tell if theyre fresh or not no clear or cloudy eyes nonetheless i picked out 2 nice sized ones and asked if he would filet them by the way he looked at me youd have thought i had 2 heads he got nervous and stammered that he could not do that geeze acmeput someone in this department that can actually perform customer service  i was actually shocked to see that they had a crown rib roast in the meat department the other day i didnt think they could do something that complicated however i might add that for an expensive cut of meat as it was it was horribly wrapped with bones cutting through the plastic wrap would you spend 5500 on a roast that was exposed towelleverything not me  please publixcome to philadelphiathe famous apple pie is poor just a large mound of cool apple slices no flavor just mushy its all just schtick was my second time there neither was impressive memorable etc better dessert options in the area if you just walk around   the employees were at best disinterested   and to top it off they over charged my credit cardthis is by far the worse starbucks in the entire city terrible customer service lacks in consistency with both pricing and quality of beverages i purchased the same coffee three days in a row and each day the price was different some days the price was 216 some days 656 thats a big difference and dont expect them to explain why the quality of the coffee is just meh taste like its been watered down the chai tea latte has no spice some days the one thing i can never understand is the total lack respect for customers at this location i mean after being charged 656 for a cup of americano i dont want to listen to you complain about customers dropping king cake on the floor and arguing about who should clean it up do your job i mean if they put as much effort into their actual job instead of complaining this place could be bearable strictly because of location   wish i could give negative starsok so we went in at 2 am after the movies and coffee down the road i must say the food is not quality i asked for bacon cheese frys close your eyes and imagine this onida frys 2 strips of sandwich cheese and 2 strips of bacon it was a sight and tasted terriblei would have tolerated the frozen square hash browns discount orange juice canned corned beef hash and over hard when i ordered over easy eggsdue to the fact that i saw the diner was understaffed and each staff was working very hard to get orders out in a timely manner which still wasnt very timely and the fact that many restaurants are cutting corners due to the economy  however when i found a course gentlemans hair in my corned beef hash this morning while dining at vons diner i had to draw the line byfar the biggest waste of 25 my husband and i both endured this and i will not be returning and i highly suggest that no one else doesi have not gotten the chance to eat the food there and chances are i never will the service there was so terrible that i cancelled my order and left i highly recommend going anywhere else if you would like to be treated with any sort of respectvery disappointed order was incorrect  no one seemed interested in helping to correct the problem by refunding the overcharge  will avoid this location in the futuredo not go here was greeted last though i got there before 2 other people then waited 35 minutes for a chicken parmesan worst service everthis is a terrible place to get in and out of the donuts taste like they been cooked in used oil the employees  always seem as they are disgusted to be there and looks at you as if you are bothering them the donuts are small and taste oily then they charge 2 dollars more per dozen than everyone else almost forgot to mention the cook in back coming out drenched in sweat holding your food  how healthy is thatreview would be a 3 12 star review for the draft and bottle selection but food is a 2 for sure stopped in on a friday night and got the brisket sliders dry 12 rack of ribs meh cole slaw tasted spoiled and corn bread the sliders had the cole slaw on them and between the spoiled taste and the dry brisket we did not finish the ribs were a bit dry and fell off the bone in one bite not the way they should be according to the bbq association everything tasted as if it was sitting around all day we live close by and love to support local businesss so we were very disappointed overallive been to this panera few times before and its always fine but tonight i ordered food to go got home realized they didnt make my sandwich correctly drove back got a new sandwich when i  got home and took a bite out a sandwich i found a nice long piece of blonde hair  i am never coming back here or to any other panera againmy fault for not inspecting the meal i bought 2 breast of chicken worth 652 basically gave me 1 breast of chicken by cutting 14 of the breast and saying that its 2 breast by the time i was home i didnt want to drive back and explain myself also their phone is out of service im not sure this place will last long its always empty and theirs better options im from miami and the pollo tropicals over there are 20 times better   go somewhere else this place is pitifulordered a sandwich on one ticket my boyfriend ordered a sandwich on another they gave us two of the sane sandwiches which were very spicey which i cannot handle just dont understand how this could be difficulti came here for breakfast with my girlfriend on a sunday it was warm inside and things were cozy the food however was nothing i will be coming back for i ordered a potato and bacon omelette and it was runny with little to no flavor not even the hollandaise folded into the omelette helped  i figured its a bakery so i should get some baked goods i purchased some banana bread a mini lemon cheesecake and an eclair the bread and the cheesecake were ok the eclair was terrible the filling was almost like twinkie cream but it was terrible   my overall experience here was not enjoyable  food wise that isthis place sucks475 for a beertight slotsbeen to vegas foxwoodsturning stone and this place is the worstvery disappointed pastery looks nice on the outside but tastes like it is a display item and not etable  they seem to have slow foot traffic and therefore are slow to sell their inventory on a daily basis my friends have catered pasteries  fruit tarts eclares petit fours cakes and have reported very uneven even stale products i hope this feedback helps them improve their product and grow into the 5 star establishment  they seem to want to aspire towe ate here last night and have eaten here often over the past few years it has been such a negative the last few times it has really gone downhill  the restaurant was dirty none of tables were clean and the staff was disappointing  the guy who made our burritos was yawning and stretching while taking our order they were completely out of chips and utensils overcharged us on our bill it is obviously being mismanagedi bought gift cards from costco at a 20 discount  great right  after two ridiculously terrible visits including hard boiled eggs on our benedicts twice  i gave the remaining gift cards away   we did go on both saturday and sunday mornings so you can read that either way  either my bad for picking a busy time or theirs for not being able to handle it  no third strike for me this place is way way overratedi had been to rembrandts once before i agree with the over pricing and the crowded atmosphere that other people have mentioned still its a neat venue and thought i would give it another try   the second time we were greeted with horrible customer service so bad that we left without ordering we arrived at 1050 am for brunch apparently the kitchen closes at 1100am we were unaware we stood in line behind about 10 people for close to 5 minutes at 1056 the cashier angrily came over and announced the kitchens closes at 1100 and they are cutting us off no apology not even any eye contact she pointed to the person standing directly in front of me and said you are the last to be served there was only 2 of us left she wouldnt even accommodate 2 more people 5 minutes before the kitchen was closing she rae as we later asked for her name does not understand customer service we had been patiently waiting and had arrived before the closing of the kitchen and she didnt even have the decency to apologize she stomped away and was abrupt to ever person that came to her register next we left without even ordering coffee we were not going to stand for horrible service and give these people our moneythis food tour was horrible both the food and the tour guide  we have been on numerous food tours in philadelphia with other tour groups that far exceeded what best tours offered on this tour  in addition we went with another couple that was new to philly and it was a complete let down all around  first the tour guide didnt speak to the entire group he addressed only 1 person in the group there were 20 people in our group second he never gave the group a full description of the places we went to or anything regarding the area we were going to  third the pizza places were so so but nothing that great  there were only 3 stops on the tour and again i couldnt tell you why these 3 places were selected as the tour guide did not say  the first place you had a choice of 2 types of cheese pizza the second place you got half a slice of pizza and third place you got a slice of either cheese or pepperoni horrible selection for a pizza tour  we were very disappointed with the tour   stick with the other food tour groups such as chew philly and city food tours  much better experience tour guides and foodthis is the worst dunkin donuts ive ever been too its filthy i wouldnt even say the staff is poorly trained because im fairly certain they arent trained at all  and they couldnt care lessi was over charge because i am a tourist they didnt provide the weight on the receipt so i asked for the weight they didnt give it to me  bewareunfortunately we came to this location for a quick snack and laurie was rude from the moment we entered the drive through i always order the roast beef slider with cheddar sauce and tonight she wanted to argue with us that her gm doesnt allow that which i dont think is the case she misunderstood and put a cheddar slice of cheese on it and when we brought it to her attention she acted even more disrespectful i asked her if she was a manager because her lack of customer service really shows she hates her job as a manager you treat your customers with respect and they will come back you treated us disrespectfully and for that we will not be coming back arbys needs to take some advice from  chikfila and learn the words my pleasure i will be contacting her gm for further informationmy boyfriend and i have been coming to this location almost everyday for a year we order the same thing every time and normally they manage to get it right in the last two weeks this location has gone drastically down hill   last sunday i waited in the drive thru line for what seemed like forever once i got up to the speaker i placed my order and was given my total when i finally made it to the window they asked what i ordered and told me that it looked like my order hadnt been entered i gave them my order two more times then paid when i was handed my medium iced coffee black and medium iced coffee with milk and carmel swirl it was very clear one of the drinks was incorrect when i mentioned this to the girl in the window she proceeded to raise her voice at me and tell me the drink was in fact what i ordered the manager finally comes to the window to see what was happening i calmly told him that i ordered a medium iced coffee with milk and carmel swirl and the drink i received was incorrect the girl in the window began yelling that i had ordered an iced carmel mocha the manager did remake my drink but neither him or the girl in window apologized for yelling at me and telling me i didnt know what i ordered  not ready to give up on this place i went back this morning to get the same two drinks again they handed us a carmel mocha and argued with my boyfriend when he said the drink was incorrect he tried the drink that their request and when he insisted it was incorrect they continued to say it was in fact what he ordered we eventually left with the incorrect drink because we were tired of arguing and needed to get to work  this location needs to get its act together and learn some customer service or it will permanently lose our businessdefinitely the worst place ive had the pleasure of visiting we literally waited an hour and a half for all of our food to reach the table and not all of us got our food my burger that  was supposed to be prepared medium well should have been ordered rare because what i got was a rock instead of actual meat most of our orders were wrong and the waitress bless her heart was trying to correct all the mistakes the manager did speak to us and said it was a weird transition of shift change which in all honesty is unacceptable personally i returned my food had it removed from the check and will be getting my dinner elsewhere an hour and a half for food to come out and orders wrong makes for an extremely disappointing experiencethis is a favorite of mine and my mothers but i was terribly disappointed today we stood there waiting to be helped at the window and out of the three men standing behind the window not one of them said anything to us but when another man cut in front of us they were quick to help him we left and ate at moby dickthe young people working here obviously take no pride in their work we ordered 4 milkshakes they were all flavorless runny soupy messes both baskinrobbins in sparks are joke6142017  the campbell location is closed for renovations wish i had know before we drove clear across town be nice if they put it on their website but i guess i expect too muchread the fine print  i recently got an email for 3 off a dream cake  i drove 20 minutes during my lunch hour to get one  this offer coincided with the start to school  for fun i thought wed celebrate that evening  i was bummed that when i got there the coupon wasnt valid because you have to print it out  i felt like it was a gimmick to get you in but who reads the fine print  showing them on the phone isnt an option even though the ad had no distinguishing numbers  i wont be suck in againprices are higher than other locations  ps cash only luv the freshness  and the rest of the staff is great but the attitude of one of the workers today was down right ugly i have been before i didnt catch  her name but she had blk short hair and a tattoo on the back of her neck but when i tell you with an attitude like that she needs to stay homecustomer service needs improvement but the woman sold me spoiled fried chicken and i had to throw away the entire plate will never go back there againi went here once when i first moved to oro valley and that was enough for me  i ordered a margarita and i noticed that they had a premade mix that they poured into the glass and the quality reflected that  it was one of the worst margaritas ive had at a mexican restaurant  i ordered a combo plate that had a taco and a couple other items but what i remember was the taco  it came out in a hard shell that looked exactly like an old el paso hard taco shell youd get at the grocery store  the ground beef had no seasoning  it was like my white moms taco night as a kidthis is the worst wawa i have every been too the lanes are always long and they just let the bums and homeless people just people just stand around and hangout when they  not buying anything and they make the whole store smell i will never comeback here againi was in between classes and decided i was going to buy a bowl of soup to hold me over until my night class was over i opted for the squash soup served myself and went right to checkout  a small bowl of soup was 647  in what universe is it ok to charge that much for a tiny bowl of soup i only filled it 12 way because i thought that the soup was charged by weight not container i say all that to say it reminded me just how much things cost at wholefoods and i can not honestly say that i will never shop there againa need to understand customer service very disappointed with the lack of understanding traveling down from ny to take my mother to a musical at the media theater picked mom up at the nursing home looking to get a reservation at one of my moms favorite testaruants  unfortunately the person on the phone wouldnt accommodate a reservation for our party of 4 they only take reservations for large parties sillyi dislike writing bad review but this will have to do it this is our second time giving them another chance due to the issues they had on the grand opening my sisters and i were at the grand opening and waited for two hours for the main meal which were the ramen which never came out lucky i ate beforehand because i was close to being late for work which was around the corner  so we came back few weeks later for lunch to give them a chance to fix their problems on grand opening this time the ramen came out in 10 mins  however the broth was very very salty that we couldnt finish it we tried to order something else on the menu but we gave up and went somewhere else to eat after sooo until theres improvement to be made i dont think we will be coming backhorriblebartenders repeatedly made eye contact with us as they stood there talking with the same 2 people ignored us for over 20 mins when theres only 1015 people in the whole place so we just walked out good business plan just ignore your customers will never go backworst food service and employees known to mankind   during prime dinner time theyll staff the shit outta drive thru but theyll have one kid as a cashier inside at the counter   the shift  manager will look back every so often but refuses to help out at the counter herself her attitude stinks not worth the drivei just dont want to write a bad review but after talking with stephanie this afternoon and getting no resolution i feel its worth it no need to name call just the facts of what happened i ordered 3 round cakes for a baby shower all vanilla cakes with vanilla buttercream icing one was a naked cake it was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top it was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldnt believe that i paid money for it we were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top i was never told that there would be roses apparently this is their standard but no one mentioned it to me so how would i know it would be on there also when i stacked the cakes the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes all the same icing one super white and the other two were a yellow color they tasted different and i know what the frosting should taste like since i had a sample of it before ordering obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes stephanie explained that they didnt know i would be stacking it so it didnt seem like it would matter all the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes stephanie and i spoke about this on the phone and i emailed her a confirmation that this would be done naturally they werent cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base plus we had to take the naked cake off of its cardboard base so we could stack it which was just annoying and unnecessary also the cakes were dry it was just so disappointing all around i really wanted to like this bakery but for how many things they got wrong and then to not give me a refund considering the issues were their fault im astoundedthe service gets extremely slow once the sun goes down i guess since they figure they are two hours to closing time they should just have one person helping customers behind the counter they also let this weird old lady hang around the store and disturb customers not a pleasant experience all in all the only good thing is the tvs they have on the wallsfor a beer and app cant beat it all kinds of promotions during the sports season food is ok not consistent preparations though the service is indicative of most florida food joints kids without a clue of what service is all about ps i had a fork straight from hell no pun this thing was dangerous i showed it to the manager a clueless kid she took it from me and never saw her again no comp no apologythis could be an entirely pointless review but i really have no idea what their coffee tastes like i went in midday for an iced coffee i wanted to sit outside but there is no outdoor seating just a spattering of chairs and tall tables with stools inside i decided to stand at the table while i waited for my iced coffee which was supposed to be made using their roasted rwandan blend  nobody gave me an indication of how long it would take only that my name would be called they were nice enough when they communicated that to me but i still went in with the expectation that it could take up to 15 min after 15 min i started internally debating if i should make an inquiry about my 5 iced coffee then i decided ill wait a little longer because i dont think i could appreciate the taste of a beverage hastily made for someone who was starting to get agitated  the waiting continued and then i started to think that my name was whispered and someone stole my cup or they just took my money and ignored my order completely i stood there coffeeless and waiting for nearly 40 min then i just came to the conclusion that one comes to when they realize they werent really that invested in the first place which is fuck it i didnt bother to even ask what happened or try to get a refund keep my money i am too poor to be spending money on overpriced coffee anyway that transaction will stand such that i just purchased a fresh batch of casual contemptthis location drive thru is so slow ive been waiting in line for ten minutes before is started writing this review there are still two cars ahead of me1220 pm 10 minutes to be seatedseated for 15 minutes and no server or acknowledgement that we exist restaurant 90 full and no staff 122115  good past reviews what happenedthis is the worst steak n shake ive ever been to waiting 5 minutes in the drive thru before they acknowledge that youre there is ridiculous ive tried to give them the benefit of the doubt on their slowness a couple times now never again will i go there horribleif you can not tolerate smoke stay away from this casino cigar smoking is a big draw here too not just cigarettes you have to wade thru the smoke to get to a small smoke free room of machines no smoke free table games for us no smoke free eating area no smoke free bar area either your health is a none issue apparently   if you want to gamble in a casino that is 100 smoke free come to md my home state as a state md wants you to spend your discretionary income in md wo jeopardizing your health or md workers health gaming is not important enough to visit this casino more than once for me   just keeping it real folks i stopped smoking 25 years ago for the recordbest bagels in the area by far  no issues there but the place is the worst run store ive ever been in  besides the lady behind the counter serving food while visibly sick  coughing sneezing sniffling  they have no concept of how to help more than one person at a time  if they are cooking something forget it you cant even talk to the people behind the counter  multitasking is not in their vocabulary so plan on a very frustrating wait if there is a linemy friend bought an iced coffee and found gross gooey things in it we will never buy another iced coffee from here againi stopped in at sunrise cafe this morning went to the counter and ordered coffee and a bagel i was told it would be just a minute while they toasted the bagel i stood and waited there while the counter person kept telling it would only be just a couple minutes more after what seemed forever one of the kitchen personnel walked out i politely excused myself for interrupting her but said that i had waited almost half an hour for a toasted bagel she replied that they were busy i said that i could understand that but that it should not take thirty minutes to toast a bagel instead of going intro the kitchen to check on my order she went to the cash register pulled out the tape and told me that i had ordered at 912 and had only been waiting ten minutes since it was past 930 i suggested to her that her math was wrong she replied that i should feel free not to return walked into the kitchen and returned with the wrapped bagel the delay was annoying but her rudeness was unacceptable i will never go back therecame here late 930 for dinner after a long day at work the place was totally empty and the staff were trying to keep it that way so they could clean up and go home  understandable but not a very friendly experience the major negative was the next day when i ended up with food poisoning and spent the entire next day on my bathroom floor safe to say i will never go back to this locationwhat on earth is going on with this place it has so much potential but fails to deliver on so many fronts   plus why is the ac on so high we had to get wraps to keep ourselves from freezing to deathlast night the boy and i ventured down to the philly night market in south philly and like so many others once we saw how long the lines were we decided to find a restaurant to eat at instead and just enjoy the ambiance   weve heard quite a bit about izumi and were always on the lookout for good sushi not that many choices in this city and since they were able to seat us right away at the bar this seemed just perfect  flash forward 2 hours and 40 minutes later wed consumed roughly 6oz of food apiece the kitchen had botched our order 3 times the only way we managed to get any food whatsoever was when our concerned waitress wandered over every 40 minutes to cock her head to one side and muse oh did you not get your suchandsuch yet ill go check only to put the order back in the kitchens queue not at the front of the line where it should have gone   i take full blame for not standing up for myself and pointing out how ridiculous their multiple errors were im not complainer by nature but this was beyond any mistake ive seen in a restaurant at the end of our stay when the waitress sheepishly informed us that our last dish was still cookingslowly do you want to just get your check i told her to just forget it we then saw them pull a raw piece of meat out of the oven and throw it away we would have been there for another 45 minutes at least   what infuriated us the most was the lack of offering to take something off the check let alone comp the whole dinner or at least bring over something as a while youre waiting apology i dont feel as though the world owes something to me but i do believe in restaurant etiquette the restaurant was crowded but there wasnt a line out the door  it was just normal full as the tables around us were efficiently fed and turned over i resigned myself to leaving a 0 tip never did that before and promised to  never darken their doorway again  i give this place one star for 2 reasons 1 yelp doesnt let you give zero stars 2 the food that they did give us a hastily ordered salmonandavocado roll and a spicy tuna roll  not exactly what you go to a destination sushi place to eat  just to have something to chew on was actually pretty good thanks for a lot of nothing izumi maybe ill come back the next time i have a 3 hour car inspection waiting timei noticed all the afroamerican bus boysand i said hmm so i inquired at the cash register if they were any afroamerican male wait staff and he said unashamedly no food was ok service was quick took forever to get a coffee refillterribledont waste your moneystaff is super rude food is terribledont waste your money or your timelet just say we have been to bjs and have always loved the food it seems that every bjs that i go to though seems to be under staffed and you cant get your order in like 15 minutes after we were sat i think that your team needs to have some urgency and make sure all the guest in the building are happy this whole concept of sitting your servers 10 tables at once and thinking they are giving above and beyond service is ridiculous so food is great love your specials just you need to have a manager out on the floor assisting with guest and team members this will boost your rating and bring back life long guest who will rave about you i really hope this helps and i will be looking forward to a reply to know that this will be fixedreally this should be zero stars im not sure how this particular location can be consistently bad for so long i live not far from this location but i will usually drive farther to another location because from top to bottom this location fails every once and a while like today ill stop by and see if they were able to turn it around well im sad to say that they still are awful im really shocked that this location is able to stay in business this long  i went through the drive thru and ordered a kfc value meal 15 minutes later i got my food apologies are you kidding i had clearly inconvenienced the staff by being a paying customer they essentially tossed me my food without saying even thank you or come again i drove away my mistake and noticed when i got home that my drink was wrong i received no napkins and no plastic ware  overall this place has consistently the worst fast food staffing that i have ever seen who ever manages this location should be ashamed and consider another profession do yourself a favor and go to the wendys next door they are consistently goodwholefoods hot foodcold contain soy and canola  wheat etc which is a gmos please be   becareful when buying the labels may be there but they dont tell the whole story of what u are about to ingest   wholefoods u need to better at organics  your produce is  excellent  your meat department is excellent  bread department excellent  please offer more organic hot foods that r labeled its far and fewwent there since someone recommended the bakery  we definitely received white people treatment at an asian restaurant which happens and its fine when we sat down the woman immediately took the chop sticks off the table and brought back forks then we ordered hot tea and when we got that we werent quite ready to order so we said we needed a few minutes once we were ready i couldnt get anyone to come over for at least 15 minutes i finally flagged down someone who was running by   the bbq pork wonton soup was ok the mongolian beef was supposed to be spicy but came out really bland  a quick 3040 minute lunch took over 1 hour and 15 minutes kind of ridiculous   we skipped the bakery but will eventually try to just walk in and pick up something next time not sitting down to eatthis is gross dont drink the tea when i asked for it was told they did not have any because they had to clean the tea canister one would think it was clean nightly or more often than we had to clean and cant sale it not only that i was given ranch and looks like something my cat would of snotted up food sat in the food warmer case way too long the mash potatoes were too hot dont get me wrong i like hot food but it burnt my sons mouth it was the last thing i eat and was still really too hot for me to enjoy  stood at the front counter and was ignored more than once saw a guest on her lunch break that had to ask for a refund it took so longcreamer spoiled in coffee they brought me milk that was spoiled as well no apology ignored from then on like i did something wrong waitress more interested in speaking to her friends the food was so average go to nudys or classicwas that mexican i think not  no taste no spice and not even close to mexican   my dogs would not eat it when i could not get it downafter the bartender told us he made awesome margaritas we trusted him with our request for two watched him pour montezuma triple sec and lime juice in a cup and fill the rest with soda the result was something like sour dog piss and tequila the salted rim was the only good part then he charged 8 when the menu said 6 wont be coming here againthis place is terrible the bagel was not edible which is hard to believe considering i think it came from a store bought package similar to a thomas bagel or something not worth it dont gothis place needs to get it together ice cream machine is always out of order has happened at least 5 times the worse part is getting stuck in the drive through just to find out the machine is broken again not going here again ive been here three times and have had three poor experiences once it took twenty minutes for a cheeseburger another time the pizza was cold when i got it and the last time i called a few times with no answer then drive there to see employees sitting at the tables when i walked in they said their equipment was brokenwhen i started going to the kingshighway mcd their game was to refuse you a cup and the counter then ignore you for as long as possible when you tried to get one that issue seems to have been addressed largely by myself but since then ive had naked burgers fries that looked like they were swept off the floor undersized orders and most recently long delays while they leave my burger down near the grill where it cant be seen one of the girls walking by loudly mocked me by saying is this customer still waiting for his order none of them ever touched it it took me 17 minutes of standing there while others were served around me before i could get the attention of the manager who got me my bag in 10 seconds  i dont like needless conflict in my life i dont want to be part of this war i am at peace with different people i would hire them without prejudice i am always as polite as i can be there i honestly am  this place is consistently and deliberately hostile their service is pointedly antagonistic toward anyone they dont like the looks of and they dont care how far they take it in the two years ive been going there the management has not been effective in controlling the issue  they are just around the corner from me and it was handy sometimes but ive finally had to give them up its better for every part of my body and mind never to go there againprobably the worst chinese buffet ive been to in the indy area food was discolored and bland tasting even the prepackaged fortune cookies were an odd colori use to love going here but service has severely fallen short recently the food and drinks are still good the problem comes with if you actually get what you ordered wrong drink and food given when i come into the store to tell them of the issue im having they talk to me like im to dumb to understand whats going on even though they were the ones that handed me an order through the window with a girls name on it and not even close to my order dont be condescending toward your customers the friendliness from this place is sorely lacking when it use to be one of the better places to go too its a shameif i could give less i wouldthis place was horrible order was wrong twicealways cold and extremely overpriced i was so happy to hear the are closingmy eyes r still watering  what the heck the smell of ammonia was overpowering at the bar  food service and ambience dont matter when u can not breathe  really this was bad  can not imagine what happened to require that disinfecting horrible excuse for latin food the service is horrible and the black bean soup is watery and has no flavor  the person who brought us out food didnt even know what plate was what  the tortilla soup is supposed to have avocado and cilantro which it had none of  the waiter never came out to ask us how things were he has rude and snatched our menus before we were even finished  horrible ill never go backgotta love when you get overcharged for the wrong order and your food is cold not only that but being charged 11 for one person is fine if im at a sit down restaurant eating a big meal for fast food its ridiculous my meal should be 8 tops for the small portions my suggestion skip wendys and go straight to chickfilaoverpriced i was at the city and wanted to pick up salsa and chips when i came home and opened the tomato salsa i realized that the salsa was gone bad i mean i trusted the grocery store and didnt bother to get a receipt and basically i went ahead paid for a rotten foodhorrible customer service fromno other than alam the manager  then to top it off they didnt put the lid on but instead just placed it on top i grab my coffee and turn around to leave and of course pop goes the lid and hot coffee pour out all over my arm hand and legs  sorry alam but its time to find a better career maybe pizza delivery boyhorrible this place gives meaning to the word crap this place is in a great spot next to the airport i work next to the airport and mentioned i was going there to eat and everybody tried to talk me out of it but i went anyway the food was dry and tasteless and the place needs a good cleaning stay awayfar away from this placenot good at all  ate there 2 weeks ago on sunday  ordered 2 pounds of alaskan king crab  60 per pound and there were disgusting and freezer burned  we also ordered a bunch or other seafood  blue crabs  snow crab bill was just as much as eating at barclay prime  and we had no drinks  i will never eat there again  even if it were free  i would not go back dont bother stopping in here  i did you the favor of trying it out and am here to report our visit left a lot to be desired  we tried the first two breakfast burritos im pretty sure they are microwaved  my bf commented the coffee tasted like a hotel coffeereally watery and bland i ordered a cafe au lait and it was probably the worst one ive ever had taste and calvin fletcher coffee co make this drink the intended way and it is a completely different beverage than what i was served here  two women walked in after my boyfriend and i had been seated for 510 minutes and their food was brought out before ours was  this place might as well be a starbucks  very disappointingi needed to fill some holes in my spice rack and was referred to tj from a friend   she assured me that trader joes had cheap spices and a good selection  im not sure if all locations are the same  but the spice isle at this particular store was 2 feet wide and three shelves high   they probably had 1012 different spices in all and many were basic and useless     though the prices were rather low i thought for a minute that i may have missed the actual spice isle and that this was perhaps a display shelf  i traversed the entire market in search of some help to either aid me in locating the true spice isle or to assure me that their meager 10 jar shelf was the best they had to offer    no luck  i may have laid eyes on one or two employees but none were too concerned with making so much as eye contact w me let alone offer any help whatsoever  now i would be a whole lot more understanding if they store was super busy or it was the day before thanksgiving or something   but this was just a lazy saturday morningmaybe 20 patrons in the entire place  just nothing to purchase and no one to convince me otherwise      so i dropped my basket on the floor and left  went to albertsons where their spice isle was 20  30 feet long with hundreds of options from which to choose    i got every spice i was looking for in five minutes   many were 2 for 3     not going to trader joes again any time soonif everhad a very negative experience  it was 10am on a thursday and they were training someone so it took a bit for someone to take my order  i ordered 2 donuts and an iced vanilla chai latte   apparently it comes frozen not on ice  this was not explained to me  i would not have ordered it if i had known  the person was rude and didnt understand my complaint just said there is crushed ice in it  so frustrating was not good   wouldnt order any coffee drinks here   i got to my car to take a drink and it leaked out all over my off white suit shirt  i will not be going to this store ever again  i have told all my friends this is not good   it will be awhile before dunkin donuts gets my businessbeen good other times  this time was a total let down  i think they are going through new ownership  i will give them one more try but if it is anything like this meal we just had  they will  not be open long  its sadgreat idea not well executed  we ordered three pizzas  after a while they brought us one obviously not one of our orders we sent it back  in a while two more pizzas came out which were obviously ours  a long time later still not third pizza  we followed up and it was no where to be found  strange as we watched it being built   we finally got a replacement ordered  they still didnt deliver it had to go find it ourself    while there we observed several people upset with their order   one table they brought three pizzas to them and each was wrong  i think our pizza was put in the pick up area and someone at home was pissed about the pizza they got  the problem seems with lack of management  there didnt appear to be anyone in charge looking over the process and staff  i would  not recommend pieology until they they get their act together  at least stay away on busy days and times    food quality appeared ok to me but that is subject to tastea 59 cent taco from taco bell is ten times better than the 250 tacos served at this joint they seem to be trying to hard to make original tacos but they only succeed in turning out bland tasteless ones i got five different kinds and couldnt tell one from another a big waste of time and money oh and someone should tell them that tacos should be served on heated corn tortillas and not cold flour ones good luck local taco with your menu youre gonna need it el yuckoi am sorry for one star however i read reviews before entering and thought that most were just being negative honestly for what i just eat and paid for mcdonalds is better yes mcdonalds i got a woodstock and fries the bun was about the size of a double cheeseburger bun at mcdonalds the meat really didnt have a taste to it the bacon tasted like it was deep fried in two week old grease and the fries seemed like were warmed up in the microwave the homemade ketchup not good either now on to the service i know these waitresss make low hourly wage and depend on tips however to get a tip you have to take care of your customers i had to ask for coke even though she walked by twice and looked at my empty glass  i had already drank the melted ice the third time she walked by i had to ask her even though she looked at the empty glass to bring me a coke then i asked for mayo joe she said ok and then waited on another table maybe its just me butthe only smile i got was when i was leaving and then i bet she didnt smile when she picked up the receipt i will not come back and take heave dont be like me i am sorry for the long review and i hope you have a great dayso ill start with a couple of positives i loved the bacon bucket nice tvs and ok beer  that said the service is pretty bad in my opinion a place that has multiple beers should have a menu that people can look at and not a tv screen that scrolls through i respect the conservation of paper and all put printing a few menus isnt a bad idea also note to danny boy maybe the service would be better if he staff didnt drink more than the patronsif i could give lower rating i would this is the worst dunkin ever absolutely awful mean old lady works there in evening good luck getting a correct ordernot good sushi at all the 5 kani salad is literally a whole sliced cucumber with 6 strands of crab in it 11 specialty roll was tiny as hell and didnt taste great fish used for sushi was just okay rice needed more vinegar as it was super bland if youve ever been anywhere for good sushi aka have any standards dont waste your  herewalked in at 11 on a saturday there were 10 open tables but was told they wouldnt take walk ins because their computer was down absurd will not try to come againfood was not good it was bland and dry  they give you a tiny probably 20 chips cup with chips no refill and salsa haha it was pico it had chopped tomatoes onions and cilantro  we order chicken fajitas and nachos the chicken was incredible dry no flavor and orange nachos were ok nothing to rave but ok  the place was overprice for the casual dinning experience and quality of the food we just moved to this area from texas and i must say this place is considered mediocre on the south and for similar quality places you would expect lower prices oh and lets not forget the we dont take credit cards and if you want to pay with a debit card you need to get to the counter to pay and get charged 099 for using the card wth you can tell a restaurant is cheap when they dont want to pay the fees for using a credit card and they make you the customer  pay for using a debit card  seriously you will better off going to chilis and get their generic mexican food that at least taste fresher will not go back to this place nor will we recommend this placei would give it half or no stars if i could first when we walked in the line was to the door there was another shorter line but i soon found out that it was a line for complaints and corrections to orders i soon was in that line avoid this placenice location and restaurant but awful service this is a newly built pizza hut so the building is nice and new wish i could say the same about the service ive ate here before and have been ignored by my waitress the second and last time i ate there my supposable hand tossed pizza turned out looking like a thin crust doughy awful tasting pizza not to mention meanwhile as we are eating you can hear the employees in some sort of an argument avoid and save yourself from the disappointmenti so wanted this store to be good one really nice thing is that the store is spacious unlike the former vons store there are no cardboard stands of goods blocking the aisles two carts can fit side by side in the aisles unfortunately it is expensive in addition yesterday i went in again and several products had no prices namely the butter which i had intended to buy i realize the quick changeover mustve been a nightmare but it was frustrating to find missing prices i did report it and was assured that would be fixed soon  also last time id bought the haggen brand of ice cream only to discover later that the 4th ingredient on the list was corn syrup solids the haggen brand of cinnamon rolls had corn syrup and corn syrup solids i know sweet rolls and ice cream are hardly health food but why add corn syrup  i ended up going to albertsons to buy the exact same items id gone to haggens for but for much less alas its a lovely grocery store but much more expensive and not necessarily higher quality im hoping the manager will take notice and adjust pricing sooni just had the worst experience with this quiznos  we decided to order lunch for delivery since we are having a sort of lazy saturday  we spoke with someone i ordered the veggie guacamole and the boyfriend got an italian  we also got one bag of chips and two sides of dressing we were told it would half an hour  like that ever happened  an hour later we are starting to ponder the fate of our sandwiches  there was no delivery driver in sight  then behold he pulls up to our house  half an hour after they said they would  we realize there are no chips or dressing in our delivery bag  we alert the delivery driver who offers to run back to the store to get them for us  we decline since it seems silly to send him all the way back to the store for a bag of chips  my veggie guacamole sandwich is sans guac  how does this happen its in the freaking name of the damn sandwich  we call management  we speak to evan tell him what was missing from our order and he immediately responds by offering us to run the sandwiches back out with a coupon for twenty percent off our which is not likely at this point while i appreciate the offer i am not going to wait another hour for a five inch sandwich  he acts very surprised by the fact that it took an hour gives me an excuse about how he has been gone all day just got in and is making himself food    i told him i would rather be refunded for order at which point he gets confrontational stating that even though way more than half our order is messed up we can still eat the other sandwich so he takes off the veggie and the chips gracious of him considering i never got the chips and we hang up    the boyfriend bites into his italian to find veggies that he ordered missing and at this point i dont even want to deal with them again  so quiznos i was sort of excited to try you again  i hadnt eaten there in years and now i am sitting here wondering why i decided to give you another chancewe waited almost an hour for pancakes and scrambled eggs when we asked the server how long itll take hie responded the people in the back are working really hard horrible customer service just horriblei almost committed suicide at this mcdonalds it was so bad cant believe i am even writing a yelp review on a mcdonaldsa atrocious  r ratchet b  bizarre y  yikes s  sad sad sad  ok so it is totally our fault for eating at this arbys  but after a long day of eating really good food see review from commanders palace  and yes  commanders palace to arbys is a major fall from grace  we didnt have the energy or stomach capacity to sit through another huge meal that day but were afraid to head back to the hotel wo having a little something for dinner  we popped into arbys after bypassing all of the scary looking dives along bourbon street  in the distance we saw arbys which generally represents safe fast food  au contraire my norleans frere    upon arriving the manager had to prompt one of his seven workers hanging out behind the counter to actually take our order  after some prodding i was waited on by a young lady who indicated that she was sluggish bc she had to work until 4am  it was only 9pm at that point  ok fine  i get it  i tried to encourage her and proceeded with my order  all i wanted was a classic blt  which clearly many patrons dont order from this location as the prep cook repeatedly asked the cashier she ordered a blt  as if i had ordered caviar and quail eggs    sit back bc it gets worse  we noticed an interesting crock pot  slow cooker on the counter  interesting bc the handle on the lid was missing and they had it rigged up with some sort of wire  when we asked what it was used for  they said it was used to keep the au jus sauce warm  surely this rigged up crock pot cannot be a part of the customized  standardized arbys franchise plan    additionally we waited nearly 10 minutes while they fried an order of mozzarella sticks for my friend i guess it was a slow night for the staff bc the guy working the deep fryer thought it  would be cool to throw the mozz sticks to the prep cook who was waiting to place them in the bag  of course the bag slipped from the prep cooks hands and landed on the floor  she then proceeded to ask my friend if she wanted the mozzarella sticks that had fallen on the floor since in her words the actual mozzarella sticks hadnt hit the floor or if we were willing to wait for them to fry up another batch  yep you guessed it  another 10 mins for them to fry another batch  lesson learneddont go here on a saturday night for drinks with friends unless you want slow service with an attitude we always try to give this place a shot but its become known as a clear stayaway save your moneyso i no refill on coffee no service poo  sad  everyone gone a mothers day cookie  but not me  no bill  had to get up and pay i how its mothers  day but there was enough servers around and bussers that this should not had happenedjim the waiter shouldnt make comments about customers where they can hear it very poor customer service wont go back again5 people taking orders no one making coffee  waited 10 min and my coffee cup with my name on it still sat  i dont have time to wait 10 min for a 5 coffee   worst starbucks ever  seemed cooperate was sitting around watching this all happen never againtrys to have a cool hip vibe but doesnt deliver on anything else espresso was good but they are luckily they are in the food desert of donelson actual restaurant is dirty and looks rigged up by duck tape  ordering process is annoying staff is all hipsters with no sense of urgency and with as many egg options on the menu they should really learn how to cook onei give this starbucks one star never has cold brew when i go in here today it was 856 am whoops sorry no cold brew youre kidding girl at counter wasnt very receptive barely gave me my oatmeal with what i asked for and i told her light ice on iced coffee did not happennasty nasty nasty steer clear  ive been told theyve had trouble with the board of health on several separate occasions  i live very near here and i wont even get a cup of coffee from here i drive to the one on elysian flds  i610    the last time i visited this restaurant was in 2006 and the staff were rude incompetent impatient  unprofessional  i dont get anything from here  i ignore this place and avoid it like the plagueworst service ive ever received from a starbucks they had four employees working while most of them were standing around while theres was eight people waiting for there drinks the manager on duty or supervisor didnt seem to have any sense of urgency on getting the drinks made  and neither did the employees terrible experience and even worse servicei think they must have several new people a young girl dumped a coffee down the side of my white car with barely an apology  and what the heck is going on with the drive through wait time i was trapped in the drive through for at least 30 minutes unbelievableextremely rude customer service and uncalled for  what happened to the friendly people herewe tried to eat lunch here with 7 of us and the whole place empty and were rudely turned away because large parties usually call ahead  if i could give this place a negative star i sure would  besides being in a hard to get to blase strip mall it had no ambiance  feel bad for the owner with such poor employees  dont waste your timeabsolutely terrible service went through the drive thru and waited over 15 minutes for my food absolutely unacceptable will not be backi hate places that advertise with a coupon but then have special conditions  did the drivein with a coupon buy one get one free up to 8  when they looked at the coupon they said they would only take the coupon if we bought an 8 combo which was the most expensive item  nogo  went to el pollo loco insteadmanagement with the long in unkept hair stood and laughed at how long the line was for flowers was on valentines day great way to treat paying customer instead of laughing why dont you go help or one of the other 4 people that was standing next to youi will let the one rude employee slide service otherwise was unremarkable what i find utterly unacceptable is that the exit at the rear of the dining area has been blocked by a trash receptacle blocking egress in case of a fire or other emergency i am certain this is a violation of fire and safety codes even by tennessee standardsto be exact this review is for store  1021 the one across from the lego store in the king of prussia plaza mall 160 north gulph rd  i visited this store twice and in both of my visits i have to say that the experience was very bad  the staffs were nice at first but once they realize that you are just browsing their attitude change what irritated me the most is the so called store manager  owner whoever that guy was that is in charge  he is arrogant has an attitude and is a smart ass  i agreed with some of the previous reviewers that i am surprised that they are still in business  all i can say is i wont be spending a dime in your store and will not recommend your store to anyonemediocre pizza terrible service pizza showed up folded  squished single most painful ordering process i have ever experiencedwe were at a bar called rusty nail only food was a food truck called foodie call its 8pm and all i know is im super hungry they didnt take credit cards by now theres no excuse not to take credit cards not only is there square theres a ton of other credit companies that do mobile so i had to go get cash and pay the atm fee ok so i go get cash purchase my food which are wings and fries i realize they dont give me any sauce for my wings now wings always comes with some type of sauce whether its ranch or bleu cheese i ask for ranch and he tells me its an additional charge ive used all my cash to buy the food that i couldve easily paid with my credit card i ask if its possible to just give me ranch with no charge and he says no i walked away pretty disappointed did not take credit and couldnt possibly give me sauce for free which is probably one cent per pour yep sorry bad reviewmaybe its too much to expect but a pleasant staff would be nice  i had an awful experience today with nashiir some individuals should take a step back and realize working with the public might not be for themvery disappointed no follow through from the individual who said she would call me back piss poor customer servicethey have been closed more the last couple of week than they have been open very frustratingwent into giant on a busy sunday to get a 12 pack of beer and 3 other items cashier at beer garden refused to ring out my other three items even though other cashiers have done it there before when i asked if i am expected to go get in another line she said yes i guess so needless to say i cashed out my other three items and did not buy the beer from them with grocery stores stealing business from bars and restaurants maybe they should try to be a little more accommodatingordered twice from this sonic in the past week 1st time got the ultimate chix sandwich with onion rings and a shake the shake was great hard to mess that one up onion rings were okay not cooked to order like advertised chicken sand was old and terrible 2nd time i ordered and asked him to cook fresh fries he said sure fries were luke warm doubles cheeseburger not fresh and i will not returndo not go here unless you might die of starvation  i kid you not that my meal took 36 minutes in the drive thru at 944 pm on a wednesday night only 3 cars ahead of me i waited all that time and my order was not difficult double cheeseburger meal no onions but of course it had onions so if you want to wait forever for the wrong meal go there but i will never spend another dime there ever againhorrible ass place cant ever get shit right machines always donefries always old and cold worst mcdonalds ive ever been too never in my life will i go here againblue moon pizza just doesnt get it after my wife called to order a pizza to go she explained to the young lady answering the telephone that our last pizza from there was way overdone and the shrimp were totally dried out the employee said she was sorry and they would be more careful this time when i went to pick up the pizza it was more done than the last time and the shrimp were like jerky i believe they were showing a little passive aggressiveness since we complained not to worry blue moon we wont be returning again how sad is it to lose a loyal 15 year customer just because you received a little criticism or you just dont care what your customers think about your product stay away from this place if you want a good pizzaordered a lexi with me and my buddy tasteless and overloaded with onions big waste of money called to see about possibly getting another in its place guy basically told us we were out of luck i work hard for my money and this was supposed to be a treat pissedi work until midnight by the time i get to sahuarita mcdonalds i take 10 mins out of my drive only to hear that the machine is down they are only taking cash i mean i hear this every time i go would be nice if they post on their 24 hr sign that for some reason they only take cash after midnight seems a little strange too me im thinking the crew doesnt want to work  2 or 3 in the morning and make up the story of machine being down cash only rule its every time i got late at night how can the machine always be downvery disappointed offer a sale on sausage mcmuffin with egg and then they dont even make it the right way egg is not supposed to be folded like the biscuit sandwiches i wonder if mcdonalds corporate would be ok with them changing the recipes consistently get subpar food from this location needs new ownersmanagement    strike 22 weeks later order a mcrib get home and no sauce just a dry piece of meat on a bun what a miserable excuse for a mcdonalds wouldnt give them a star if i didnt have toso we decided to give this place a shot because its around the corner when we walked in the deserted yogurt bar that use to be underdogs it appeared clean and i think it was clean because it was also empty the owneremployeedisenchanted worker asked us if we had ever been we said no he explained the process and then mentioned the health content which i had to chuckle at due to the nature of putting unhealthy toppings on a healthy frozen treat he seemed sad and then said if we filled up our cups it it would roughly be 7 so we tried several flavors of yogurt all of them cohesive flavors to put it bluntly it was some of the shittiest frozen yogurt i ever had you know how most people complain about toppings im telling you there was the most bizzare aftertaste ever kinda like feet and lemon being put into yogurt i had the pumpkin cheesecake with chocolate and vanilla gross all around gross my friend had apple crisp and vanilla that too was gross the toppings were ok not the best but i did think it was cool he had hot fudge and quite a selection ours wound up being 19only one person in front of me  waited for someone to help me a guy walked right in front of me in front of the salad spot the worker asked if he needed anything and got his order and im still waiting for a good 5mins with no help i will not be back to that location 5 people behind the work station and not one person could help meplace is so very bad  use to live in area and remember why i did not shop at store often  was in yesterday and did shoppingalot of stuff not on shelfs and employees every place but register  when we went to check out had 1 express open and 2 other registers  place was packed and needed way more open   i left a full cart of food  at register and left  i use acme in morton and other areas in these other stores they always have more lanes open  acme lost out today here because i had a easy 250 dollars worth of food  went down the street to giant and was in and out in now time   acme in upper darby will never have a good review if they stay like thisi stop at this burger king sometimes on my way to work and besides the fact that they are usually slow the workers are pretty nice well my last experience happened on 1292016 i went there in the morning and ordered maple oatmeal there was a hangnail in the oatmeal which i didnt find until i got to the end it was so sickening stomach turning disgusting vile and every word you can think of i will never go to any burger king ever againlol worst mic dicks yet spicificly asked for fresh fries and got cold ones as usual finally got the no onions right thothis place is overrated for sure the food is mediocre at best we had the french toast which was soggy and had little flavor the location is loud and stuffy they have too many tables for the space also tried the watermelon lemonade which was full of sugar and had a slice of rotten and spoiled watermelon on it wont be coming backfood we had falafel hummus baba ganush salad and 5 orders of shawarma the falafel was nice crispy and airy but alas was extremely bland despite being listed as being served with tahini it did not arrive until we asked for it hummus was ok a bit watery and too creamy baba ganush was good salad too the shawarma was terrible  firstlyit wasnt a shawarma at all it was not shaved off a spit just chopped chicken that was grilled or fried the meat itself was dry and tasteless you cannot get a worse specimen of the dish  service  terrible  the restaurant was empty and yet everything took way too long it took about 10 minutes just to get our drinks  iced tea  the staff appeared to be on drugs  dazed and clueless  the check arrived with 18 gratuity tacked on turns out that on one of the back pages of the menu  the desert menu there is a notice that parties 6 and above will be charged automatically this statement must appear on every page of the menu   the owner the real problem is that we were a party of 5 that did not prevent the despicable owner of the restaurant to instruct the server to apply the automatic tip  when confronted instead of apologizing and offering to refund the tip he showed us the door poetically telling us that customers are like birds they come and go makes no difference to him  so you decide if such a loathsome human being deserves your business there are plenty of other mediterranean restaurants in the area that serve better food have much better service and dont steal from their customersthis is the worst starbucks location i have ever been at its the closest starbucks to my house so normally i do go there however 90 of the time my orders are wrong  all i ever order is black coffee with heavy cream on a side how can you mess it up  have a bunch of employees working but even with only few people in line i managed to wait at least 10 minuteslast time i went i waited at least 5 minutes being the only customer 5 employees were present  and no one even acknowledge that i was there by at least saying         will be with you soon as we can nadawent to have breakfast with my family yesterday morning i had my daughter fianc and my fiancs son with me we asked for a high chair for my daughter and the waitress said only at a table its a fire hazard at a booth so we switch to a table i understand about fire hazards but what makes it okay to seat a family at the same booth we were originally at and give them a high chair what happened to fire hazards another waitress asked our drink order and i wanted a unsweet tea with lemon i was given a water anyways the food was decent for the price dont order the onion rings as a side order youll be lucky if you get five i wont be coming back the service was garbage and the food barely makes up for itordered delivery post writing tip amount and signing  driver states management says mushrooms came out weird  gave you more  tried to call  they tried to call once  the mushrooms were burnt and clearly were defrosted at one point or something just a big mush of nothing  when we called back to complain they actually charged us for them they lectured us about not answering out phone and said everyone likes their deformed burnt mushrooms not me though  ive probably had delivery from them over 100 times and in the last year its gone downhill  oh and its hard to tell if they gave more or not as it was just one big gross mass of dough with some over cooked mushrooms floating in there somewherei have to agree with other reviews that 10 to park is ridiculous the stench of cigarette smoke reeks the minute you walk in the doors there is a small non smoking section but the smell still hovers it should be the other way around with a small smoking section   parking should be by the hour  we werent here an hour because the smoke was so bad stupid thing is i only saw maybe 10 people smoking  been to several different casinos this year where are the free fountain sofas  the penny slots had to ask someone to find the dollar slots and they couldnt even tell us where to find them  wow found the penny slots while looking for the dollar ones  worst casino i have ever been too and its sad because it use to be fairly nice other than the smokingi had the buffett and every single item was cold  the flavor had very little resemblance to authentic indian food  chicken tikka is one of the easiest things to make and it tasted like cold leather soaked in food color  do not waste your time or money the water was very nice but the cashier was extremely rude the only thing that was passable for decent was the chai  after eating there i can see why any positive views were left by americans  nobody that knows what indian food is suppose to taste like would ever like thisunsanitary  the guy in the back is sick blowing his nose but doesnt wash his hands before touching the donuts i was so grossed out that i immediately threw away my donut and walked out without getting my bagel sandwich  theres lettuce and trash lying around in the kitchen so gross the health department needs to make a stop here yuckthe service is horrible server added 20 gratuity on our check without our consent and there are only three of us we planned to let it go but even worse they tax on the gratuity i dont what they think but it is very unrespectful and stupid the food is also getting less and less would never recommend any friend to go againnice looking place thats about all it is though not much of a coffee selection is any at all and my coffee was pretty badly burnt after receiving it almost 10 minutes later no line at all team didnt seem very knowledgeable and there was a lot of noise    we came in excited to try a new place and left highly disappointedthis place was very unwelcoming i wont be back first time i came in to see the new renovations which are beautiful but im not liking the staff i came in contact with thoworst service ordered delivery and was told it would be an hour because the driver didnt get in for another half hour which i was fine with called after hour and 15 and was told they didnt have something in my order and had to go out and get it and that it would leave soon i said to forget about that item and they could just bring the rest that was a 40 min ago i live about 5 min away and it still is not here called and was told that he had a lot of deliveries this is ridiculousi used to eat chipotle at least once a week a few weeks ago i had a complaint that i voiced with the manager basically they skipped my app order with another web order that was placed after mine and the person entered the restaurant as i was waiting for my order i wouldve been fine if the manager apologized for the oversight and stated that he would go ahead and make it by now 3 more people had come in and my ticket was still in the wall but he did not he accused me of getting feisty with him i asked for my money back and he apologized to the person behind me whos order they bumped in front of mine for the wait while he processed my return i believe an issue of poor training and managerial skills the customer is what drives a business and not apologizing for oversights and using derogatory terms is not conducive the brand i emailed corporate and they offered me a coupon for a free meal not satisfiedlet me start off by saying that this place is the chipotle of sushi  came here when they first opened and the food was ok  recently came back and notice the quality of the food was not the same  the fish and the toppings didnt look as fresh couldnt pin point which ingredients made each bit taste like trash juice   for the price they should not serve there food in plastic bowls the size of an ice cream cup  i get it this is not california or hawaii but i dont think i will be back for a third timebad service okay food bar was slow and they were out of many winesbeers and no clean wine glasses this was a wednesday  limited menu only one salad on the menu and it was a ceasar  horrible i will not go backugh  what a waste of money had the crab sandwich very bland seriously about 99 sure it comes out of a can  you think oh a shellfish and crab restaurant they should have a good crab sandwich  then you spend 13 store bought out of the can crap  coleslaw was the same story straight up out of a can store bought crap  feeling a bit ripped off at this pointi recently found out that their veggie pho broth is actually beefbased and they never had a veggie broth i guess i was being lied to every time i asked misleading costumers about the ingredients of their food is pretty shitty but if that doesnt do it for you my roommate also found a bug in her bag of sprouts   if you do decide to eat here order your food to go and wash your veggies at homei wouldnt normally leave a review for a fast food restaurant but my dissatisfaction with this fishers wendys is so strong that i feel like i need to ive had bad experiences recently going through the drive through here rude staff making me feel like ive inconvenienced them but my most recent trip there trumped all of that i took my little brother through the drive thru and as soon as i pulled up to the first window the cashier was blaring explicitlyric rap music i have never experienced something like this at any drive thru let alone one in a nice community like fishers anyway she kept telling me that i ordered something that i did not and i had to tell her several times that i just ordered the chicken nugget meal before she finally got it i paid her and she gave me back the change once i pulled up to the window to get my food a guy came up to the window and in a threatening way said you owe her a dollar like it was my fault that the cashier gave me incorrect change i gave him the dollar and he took it and laughed and said he tryna play you i will not return to this location until something changes not only is the service horrid but i would not feel safe bringing my family inside the restaurant in fear that i would be threatened if the cashier gave me the wrong changeminiscule overpriced portions of mediocre food  went by casa video to drop off some dvds and saw the truck outside and decided to get something for my familybig mistake  i got a chili meatball sub for my son and thought 5 meatballs for 5 would be a good deal to split with my wife  wrong   the sub was about 5 inches long with an afterthought of meat and cheese in the center ladled with chili that tasted like it had been sitting on the stove for two days and some flintstonesized chunks of onion there was more vegetable matter in this thing than meat cheese or chili shoved in the sidefor 9   the meatball and sauce deal was anything but  you get your choice of lukewarm if youre lucky marinara or brown mushroom gravy over 5 tiny meatballs in a plastic container suitable for an ounce or two of cole slaw was literally stunned when i saw it  to top things off the guy tried shortchanging me to boot even after seeing the look i gave that beggars excuse for a meal  buyer bewarei have been to this establishment two times both on a friday night both times were huge disappoints for the same reason the service is absolutely horrendous they dont employ enough people to handle a full house on a friday night as far as i can tell there is no service at your table as a result you have to go to the bar to get your beers this usually results in waiting anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for someone to finally take you order god forbid you cant belly right up to the bar because if you are even one level away they wont see you they obviously havent been trained to look beyond the bar for patrons wanting a drink  to make matters worse the head brewer is usually there helping himself to the tap and serving his friends who the hell runs this place the beer was good enough i especially liked the mac daddy scottish ale it was clean and malty just as a scottish ale should be the danny boy black was also good they have a ton of guest taps and the selection was good the beer might be decent but there are plenty of places to get good beer ill be going elsewherei am only giving this hotel such a poor review because of the issues we had with our billing we were recently visiting for a wedding and stayed here because i was part of the bridal party and this was the hotel they chose when we originally made our reservation we had issues they lost them originally and when we checked in and went to our room we didnt have a balcony like we had asked for upon making our initial reservation we had issues the whole trip with our room card constantly downstairs having to get it fixed because we couldnt get into our room or up the elevator upon check out we had multiple billing issues as well as others in the party to the point our credit card was put on hold due to fraudulent activity as everyone knows how inconvenient this is especially while out of town or out in general had to find out the hard way when i went to use my card and it wouldnt go through then sit on the phone and resolve the issue the hotel account manager explained to me that these over billing issues are hotel policy and should have been explained at check in my husband and i travel a lot all over the world and this has been a first dont think we will be staying here again probably better off staying down the street at the ritz insteadthe employees at this particular mcdonalds seem to have trouble filling orders correctly and the place is often filled with flies   also dont count on having breakfast here if you need to get to work early as they rarely manage to open on time  often far from it on many mornings ive found the golden arches to be lit with the doors locked the drivethrough dark and not an employee in sight although their cars are in the lotok so heres the deal the thing this place has going for it is the service these guys are super nice and you get the feel theyre all family i couldnt be more pleased with the joyful attitude everybody working there had the problem is the food it does not live up to the yelp hype and the mystery californiavisitortransplanttaco critic of the year who claims that states affiliation qualifys their discernment of a good taco californias tacos must suck i was super stoked to try this place and let down  sorry dudes keep your pleasant attitude but ditch the frozen buffalo chicken strip taco the tasteless battered fish and the over use of mozzarella the queso isnt crack its velveeta which is arguably worse for you the chili arbol was good the guac was alright it pains me to give a poor review to such nice people but you cant repair what you dont know is broken make a few changes to your menu and better luck next timehorrible i gave it a onestar because i couldnt find a zero star this place is the absolute pit of a restaurant drive through when we pulled up they said we had to go around because the drivethru wasnt working come to find out all they were doing was counting out the till and switching over cashiers biscuits no biscuits had to wait 10 minutes for those pieces of chicken look like little piece of chicken wings at least six employees just walking around  doing absolutely nothing the place looked dirty horrible will never come backno no no so wrong noodles were clumped together broth had not impactful or lasting flavorallow me to begin  i love mexican food  tonights venture was for my daughters 24th birthday  upon arrival we were seated and we waited  way too long before service began  the queso is melted velveeta  we ordered a chicken quesadilla which looked like a mixture of chicken and cheese threwn up on a tortillaalso we got two orders of bistek a la mexicana  to say it was a la was an overstatement  the steak was chewy and luke warm    everything was bland  the best taste was the refried beans out of a can im sure  the staff were not friendly when i told them it was my daughters birthday it was ignored  no smile  no acknowledgments  nothing  i wasnt expecting anything free or singing but a smile and happy birthday would have been nice the staff never introduced themselves  left dirty dishes on the table  overall it was the worst restaurant experience in my life  ive been in more than a few countries and even when i had no idea what i was ordering  i got better tasting food and service   both of my children and i have food poisoning as well  avoid this place  oh and the bill  75 complete garbage   as for the alcohol my margarita was straight tequila not usually a bad thing but not for 675 and in ice it was a waste of my time and money  never againyou get exactly the crap service you expect from a bunch of children being supervised by children  how about you open your fat wallet and hire a decent management team that can lead  i purposely drive to the green valley location which is just 1000 better in every aspect i dare you to try ordering a quarter pounder without cheese  its impossible they are too stupid  i have tried it 3 times and even the 12 year old manager could not grasp the concept that some people dont like the sawdust excuse for a slice of cheese they use  just because its called a quarter pounder with cheese does not mean that everyone want the friggen cheesemy first bad experience involved an order of lettuce wraps  the lettuce was soft dry rubbery and nasty  oh well  my next crappy visit involved getting ripped off on a drink special  when i pointed out the error the managerbartender gabe refused to correct it and asked is it really worth arguing about  nope wont be backhorrible business etiquette i work at a business where paradocx winery was booked as a vendor for an event we were hosting after confirming in advance and even prepaying for the wine they never showed up they never called or even answered a phone call throughout the night talk about bad business i would never spend my money here and would certainly never recommend anyone to give them their businessi was at knockouts recently and there was no cook on duty so i couldnt order anything to eat all i could is order drinks the place looked a little unclean so its probably best that i didnt get anything overheard an offensive comment about a disabled person i will not go back nor will i recommend this establishment based upon cleanliness and insensitive remarksthey made me wait over 30 minutes for coffee where they gave away my order and was unapologetic about it ive never experienced such poor customer service at a local shop before i can get better experience at your chain starbucks even if the coffee may not be as fancy no thanks never coming back hereworst burger king on earth there will be something guaranteed to be wrong during your visittastewaitfood temperature or overall cleanlinessyou name it  i know its the only fast food place on the block but just donti am a new orleans native and eat out often i tried grand isle last night with a friend the service was terrible  it took 2 hours to get oysters and a salad food was average to add insult to injury they add an automatic 20 gratuity when i asked the manager  lyn  about it she said it is written in small print at the bottom of a long menu it is not posted anywhere else when i asked her to reduce it because of the service she turned her back on me and walked away it was the rudest treatment i have ever received in new orleans it is a tourist resturant catering to tourists they do not care about locals or return diners beware325 for a ham biscuit the size of a silver dollar wont be back thank youthey always get the order wrong not sure if its on purpose that they leave out stuff or what every time i order a bacon burger with everything i always get the meat with cheese only this also happened to me while in the drivethrough and i had my dog the line was long so i didnt argue it but its happened to me while dinning in and the orders take forever to get ready and then the bacon they gave me after i complained was very little not worth the money or hypeive eaten here before and never had an issue but this time it was a cluster  90 minutes later and still no entrees  the server stopped by to refill glasses but no updates on the food or what the delay was all the while tables around us who arrived after we had getting their meals  hopefully not indicative of how things will be for this restaurant going forwardespresso was incredibly sour something is wrong with the extraction  while its awesome that they roast their beans on site selling 9 day old beans is not the way to go about that  the french press has all the makings of a good coffee shoproaster intersting menu great storefront and that interestingly setup visible roasting area and it unfortunately falls horribly short of that potentialordered fish wings and mac n cheese the latter had a piece of hair in it see photo also i ordered whiting but got what was certainly tilapia or catfish never again  on the semiplus side the chicken and spice coating was oknot by any means good enough to want moreterrible literally here right now and there are 0 lanes open with like 30 people in linestaff are absolutely the worst rude and dont listen i made the mistake of going back and regretted it right away they are slow and never in a hurrywhen this place first opened it was terrible then it got better and then gradually got worse again i got vermicelli today for lunch and could not get over the fact that some ingredient in the dish tasted like propane i literally could not get over it whether it was the fish sauce or the vermicelli or the meat i couldnt finish it i dont get sick from eating a lot of stuff i mean ive put down spoiled milk and bad food and been fine but i definitely got sick after this ive been raised on viet food all my life but good god nothing ever tasted like this pho is decent thoughwithout a doubt the worst pizza hut i have ever ordered from please save your time and money and go elsewhere   i have ordered from them on three separate occasions and the order has been wrong every single time this past weekend they even forgot about my order all together i should have just walked out but i waited 45 minutes for my hand tossed cheese pizza i got home only to discover it was a cheese stuffed crust and the pizza looked horribly unappetizinglooking thrown together i am incredibly disappointed that they cant get a simple pizza right and will not be backsadist behind counter sadist behind the counter indeed want to be treated like crap  come shop herehorrible service there was no sense of urgency at any time brought out one of the worst omelets i have ever had they put unsanitary ketchup packets on top of the food when they brought it out there was never a question about if i needed anything the food was just dropped off without a word unless your layover is longer than an hour dont stop here  this was probably my 8th time to eat here for breakfast in the last 5 weeks due to limited options in the airport while it is always slow it is usually better than thiseven in the middle of lunchtime on a weekday food is coldold with that odor associated with something that as waited too long where flavor transmutes to an impatient attitude you could maybe account for this by imagining the burger fries and fish sandwich had been prepared at some suburban mcdonalds and then trucked over to this urban outlet to be reheated and allow to age a bit this is an insult to the neighborhoodfirst time visiting this place after my girlfriend went on about how amazing culverts is the cheese curds were interesting but the bacon double cheese burger was over prized and burned not worth the timei love good mexican food  something this place does not have to start the guacamole was bland tasted like avocado paste out of a bag then i got the steak tacos medium which were extremely undercooked and had a terrible flavor my friend got the chicken wing tacos in buffalo sauce which tasted nothing like buffalo sauce we both each only ate one taco only because we were starving i wouldnt recommend anyone come here which sucks because i was excited about this place and love the decor service wasnt the greatest eitherthis place is a joke we waited 2 hours for cold food gyro meat tasted like it was from the day before chicken was dry no dressing for our food even after i requested extra i called to see if they could bring the sauce and plasticware and he said we were too far and it wasnt his fault i called grub hub to tell them what happened and he told them i was lying and refused to give me a refund my fiance also put up a review and he sent a compliment saying  i know you tried to get free food but not all the time you will i even told him to come back and get it if he wanted rude disrespectful and doesnt need to be working with food or people in general steak plus pizza is a much better choicepoor service bad quality chicken simply rude and not worth the southern fare chicken ive had so much betterperson at the bakery refused to write on a cake from their case and refused to call someone who would  left and went to acme no problem there at allworst store customer service is the worst everyone knows it ive given this store countless opportunities to make it up but they still seem to not care about their customers at all dont get me wrong  there are definitely employees there that are helpful but when it comes to honoring prices or making up for mistakes damaged items or missing pieces  they just assume the customer is lying or at fault im done with the store on walnut sorry for those employees that seemed like they caredwe have been living in the area for two years i have watched the steady decline of this chipotle  we eat at chipotle at least two times a week because of our jobs this place has become the great guacamole nazis instead of the normal sized spoonful that everywhere else gives this place taps the spoon until its leveled off leaving one with about a 14 cup of guac on their burrito or bowl  i shouldnt have to pay 2 for that teeny bit  next situation i have had with this chipolte is that we stopped in fifteen min before closing with people in line behind me as well the counter girl explained they were out of chicken and steak and sour cream and only had enough guac left for one serving i called them out you mean u guys were too lazy to cook up more and restock  shrugging her shoulders she replied do i want something or not the manager person came out after hearing my complaints about paying 10 for a bowl with nothing in it comped my bowl but still lazy   ive also ordered twice online both times they claimed they didnt see it and had to rush to complete once i got there   whomever does the hiring for this chipolte needs to be fired their workers suck latelythe first mizzou football game of the season was pay per view only and not that many bars were showing the game after arriving at corner pub to find there were no tables some friends and i ended up at hotshots sure there were plenty of places to sit but they quickly became full we were just happy to be able to watch the game but when the table behind us became chainsmokers we were all pretty shocked as this place was serving a lot of food  guess theyve paid their way out of participating in the smoking ban what became unbearable was the table of old men with beer bellies that lit up some huge stanky cigars  yup hotshots allows cigar smoking as well  with the tigers pummeling southeastern lousiana big time my friends and i were fed up with the smoke and left soon after halftime id rather miss watching a football game than ever come back to this place  also i really dislike any establishment that makes its waitresses dress in such tight skimpy clothing hotshots seems to be the place for hoosiery smokers to watch a gamethe food left a disgusting taste in my mouth everything is fake meat dishes not sure why vegan places cant have any creativity but its all tofu and smoky flavor a added to the foods leaves a nasty tastei hate how i even have to give 1 star   my coworkers and i are frequent porch visitors and by frequent i mean everyday so when we heard that the porch was making major changes we were a little excited that was until we received the horrible news that the food trucks would no longer be apart of our everyday lunch experience we actually looked forward to the variety of food trucks that we would be able to choose from every day a monthly print out of the choices would be circulated throughout the office and hung up on our desks in anticipation but now we are left with one food truck consisting of six options and a few patches of grass to sit on   opening day of the truck we decided to check it out i ordered the watermelon feta salad and the bbq chips w ranch dip one coworker ordered the porchetta and another ordered the fish tacos my watermelon feta salad was okay remind me never to order it again not too thrilled about the mint topping the bbq chips were also okay that dip might just be the single worst thing ive ever tasted and as far as the porchetta its not a sandwich as described to be but rather an awkward pile of extremely fatty pork meat that had to be thrown away by more than one person i know to have tried it the fish tacos seemed to be the better of the choices although it was mentioned the random cut sized fish and soggy tortillas i dont even feel its necessary to mention the prices as im sure its easy to figure out how over priced it is  we are now forced to rummage through 30th street station in hopes of finding something edible for our lunch thanks porch  30th street you have now turned our lunching into just another boring hour of our dayjanuary 2nd visit  probably my last   posted a tip earlier about how rude a waitress was here name i believe is precilla or however you spell it she saw us walk up to the restaurant and stand to wait to be seated and she totally ignored us she stared at us rudely in a span of 10 minutes to just ignore us again one of the other waitress saw us and wanted to help seat us but thats when the rude waitress finally decided to help us i currently saw the reviews here after the incident and if i would have known how bad their customer service is then we never would have ate here   anyways here only for a milk shake ordered it almost 30 minutes ago and its still not here awesome   dont go here theres a cafe upstairs go there lolnever again i have been threw drive thur 3 time every time my order was messed up on top of this i emailed the corporate office one week has passed with no response seems they care nothing of my service or myselfyou have no doubt read the conflicting reviews of strange donuts on yelp and wondered whether it is has great donuts or terrible donuts they are not very good and whether it is staffed by indifferent hipsters or friendly counter people they are nice and helpful so to recap friendly service lines arent too bad and the donuts are doughy and lacking in flavor if you want good donuts go to glazed and infused in chicago if the 300mile drive is offputting next best thing is vincent van donut in claytoncant speak for the baked goods but definitely some of the worse service i have ever encountered i walked in hoping to find a cake to buy for my upcoming wedding anniversary i was the only person in the store with two people behind the counter neither of them could care the least bit to help me and when i tried to ask questions was given almost no information ex is that cream cheese frosting or butter cream answer i really dont know but you can buy a 5 cupcake and try it then one left to answer the phone and the other went to the back  in the middle of my asking another question suffice to say i will not be spending my 36 on a cake at this placei can well agrees with erica and teri the village as they call it has to be the dirtiest diner around someone needs to tell the owners who are there almost everyday what a paint brush and a mop and bucket are dont even try the rest rooms they have not been scrubbed in years the same hot water faucet in the one bathroom has been broken for years spewing scalding hot water on you hands if you try to clean them and employes wash their hands here yeah right why the locals eat there i dont know their bodies must have built up an immunity my wife and i went there when it was new many years ago it was your basic diner we tried recently and actually cut our meal short due to the condition of our silverware now to the food yes they drop your toast when your order is put in and then it just sits in a pile for each server to grope over they always burn the omlettes the potatoes are undercooked and very greasy overall i can say the food is bland and lacks any real flavor i have not had any other meal than breakfast  but please would someone buy this place blow it up and clean it out it needs it top to bottom enjoy your meal at the village diner if you dareterrible wish i could give it zero stars ignorant worker wouldnt let me make multiple orders at the drive thru waste of timethis chipotle is absolute garbage  the staff at this location is absolutely incompetent  they under stuff your burritos forget items in your order ask unbelievably stupid questions do not clean up the mess they make after each burrito and then proceed to drag your food through it    by the time you make it to the check out they top it off by incorrectly charging you for your order and because of the idiocy at large they ask you to just accept their mistakes and move along because they cant figure out how to fix it    horrible this is all over several visitsi havent got my sandwich yet so i cant review the food i can tell you the service is the worst ive seen  may i just got lucky with the worst waitress for the first time in my long dining career i may leave no tipshow up during business hours and they are not open no sign indicating that they would be closed and no one answered the phone if a business is going to be closed at least leave your customers a note on the doorwe ordered from the grumpy guy at the counter who was repeatedly impatient with my indecisive toddlers once they did make up their minds and i told him their order he said there was no way they could handle that order if im paying and thats what they want then make it when i slightly modified their orders he still didnt want to make them we ended up walking away with no ice cream we will not be going back im guessing this grouch could end up costing them the businesswas there to use a coupon and wanted to try some of the unusual things on the menu when i got there it was a tacky holeinthewall with one rickety table and chair they didnt have several oi f the items i wanted to try and it took forever to make what i finally did order the cheesesteak i got was the worst ive had in a long time dont bother and definitely dont be swayed by the printed menunever again my co worker and i went to lunch there last week first off our silverware was dirty we immediately told the server to bring us another set that should have been a red flag i ordered a turkey breast wrap and my friend ordered the seafood mix we waited exactly 45 minutes for our food my wrap was disgusting it was soggy and the turkey smelled as if it were many days old the seafood mix is a joke we counted 5 pieces that consisted of small shrimp and scallops it costs 1999 for only 5 pieces of mediocre seafood too expensive the server never bothered to check on us because we were in my lunch hour i had to chase her down for my bill i shouldnt have paid for this disgusting meal when i went up to pay the 4100 for this lunch  the cashier asked how everything had been i told her horrible for the inconvenience she gave us a 2 discount like i said i should have walked out i learned my lesson never again i went back to work and told all my coworkers to stay away from this place also this place  is dirty if the eating area is dirty can you imagine what the kitchen looks likei just had my second visit at this restaurant hoping it would be better than the last time i ate there and unfortunately it wasnt maybe a little worse i only went there because it was the closest to my route heading home cornbread  dry cabbage  too peppery let folks add their own pepper if they want it instead of the whole batch yams  not enough flavor baked chicken  tasted like 3day old food i paid a whopping 1500  its hard to find good soul food in lou thats affordable i wouldnt mind paying that amount if i enjoyed it but the meal was totally not worth what i paidabsolutely subpar overpriced and bland wait was over 20 minutes for takeout and food was so disappointing would recommend just about any place over this even taco bell they atleast are reasonably priced for their below average productwent here again and was disappointed even more this time the banh cuon rice dumpling with pork mushrooms pork loaf fish sauce and bean sprouts tasted like they were previously frozen at first the pork loaf tasted okay but when i ate it without fish sauce i noticed it was going bad  i also got the pho and had to dilute the soup and add extra lime because it was so salty hours after my meal i felt like dying of thirst only then did i realize how much salt and msg they add to their brothtoo many problems to note  bad service seem to be or are currently unavailable one type of chicken missing item with drivethru orders the list goes on1  disfunction with the hostesses to start the night  2  drinks took 1520 mins to get   3  the orders took a long time to receive   4  one was wrong and the other was cold  the waitress asked if i would like my meal reheated in the microwave  appetite lostteavana is a scam everywhere in the country from philly to la their sales people are trained to push their overpricedlow quality product to you anyway they can whats even more amazing is the wording and tone that came out of every employees are absolutely idendical stay awaythis place has really gone down in cleanliness and quality of food first off they changed the restrooms to unisex and they are equally dirty the tables in this place need a good scrubbing because a simple wiping would not get them clean everyone working in this place appeared to be under the age of 21 and didnt seem to care about anything the food was subpar and yet they have the nerve to charge 18 dollars for it the burgers were put together in a hurry and had no taste to them the fries and cheese curds were good flies everywhere and i was not even in the mood for the custard after the meal will be going to culvers from now onthis was absolutely the worst experience ever my first and my last took an hour to get the food then it was cold we sent it back and got it cold again they gave us gift cards but we gave them back and told them to just waive the check we didnt even eat 2 hours of sitting there i was sick to my stomach i know it doesnt happen to everyone or everytime but read these reviews horriblethe 4 and 5 star reviews for reanimator coffee must be paid for because their coffee is not worth paying for hands down worst coffee ive had since mcdonalds was everyones go to for a cup of coffee too many great coffee spots out there to bother with this one verybelowaverage lightroastisgrossdonut are beautiful and creative but taste is seriously lacking  even glazed donuts are tasteless  really dry and no flavor  overall a huge disappointment  props for having good coffeei went to prep and pastry about a week ago with my girlfriend we were expecting a long line as other reviews said there would be on the weekend when we arrived we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait so we stood outside in the sun after about 5 minutes i asked one of the hostesses if there was a shorter wait time if we sat outside under the shaded patio she promptly told me that the patio was closed due to a large party renting it out not 5 minutes later they seated a table of 3 at one of the 5 empty tables out there needless to say i was pretty upset about being blatantly lied to after another 20 minutes of standing around we were finally seated the building is visually appealing inside however it was so loud we couldnt even hear each other my girlfriend ordered the am chile relleno and i ordered the tri tip sliders we also ordered a french toast to split the french toast was delicious the tri tip sliders had no salt what so ever and my girlfriends dish was absolutely cold she ended up sending it back they prepared a new one for her which also contained all but one morsel of salt they did however take half off her dish for their incompetence all in all prep and pastry is visited by people who want to be more hip than enjoy good foodread all the reviews and was very excited to try this restaurant so cute and adorable as we approached unfortunately we were not able to try it we were turned away at the door with a no dogs rule because of my fully registered trained and vested service dog i asked the hostess if she realized it was illegal to deny a service animal she said they had recently had an issue and installed the rule of absolutely no dogs cant enjoy a place that wont allow me to responsibly take care of myselfjust a warning this place is closed during the winter i had heard about this place from the daily show during their visit to the dnc 2016 and i had never heard of water ice before and this was on my must do list when visiting philly so after walking here all the way from pat and genos i was really disappointed to find it close with no indication why  turns out most water ice places are just closed in the winter unless its inside a mall but still 1 for no warning ahead of time im not a local im a tourist i shouldnt be just expected to know these things their website even said were open for the seasonthis place is a dump i got to this shady place to get lunch only to told theyre closedi would have loved to write a positive review about this restaurant however the hostess at the door did not give us the opportunity to do so i have never been treated in such manner she shoved us out the door and behaved very hostile towards me and my group of friends as a client i recommend that you treat your customers if this were my restaurant i would not tolerate a staff member who rages at clients instead of handling the situation in a discrete manner never coming backhorrible absolutely horrible service i ordered and told them im trying to see if you can deliver to my location she checked and said yes so then i placed my order they call me back after 23 minutes and tell me they cant deliver to me i say okay well when will my money be back on my card they hang up on me so i call and call again and the assistant manager will gives me a fake corporate number they are horrible workers they need to shutdown this jimmy johns i have gone to multiple all over the city its my favorite sub shop but after this i will tell many people about this horrible servicemy family came to visit the five of us ate here around 100pm by 700pm we were all feeling ill one by one three of us ended up in the hospital including my elderly mother the other two were younger and were sick at home in my opinion we all ate a similar dish and shared we all got sick you decidecame here on an afternoon with my wife the place was empty and the staff was standing around chit chatting yet it took nearly 5 mins for someone to come up to us and ask do yall need something umm we came to eat we ordered dumplings some rib eye steak and 2 bowls of ramen pork belly and brisket dumplings was good rib eye was tough the ramens came out barely room temps and the broth was super super salty definitely will not be backive came here a few times and the last 2 times my order have been incorrect i checked the receipt and the correct order was listed i suggest to better train your staff and make sure they are paying attention to detail if not you will continue to lose customers this is consistent trendwas seated and watched the show between the owner and a server for 15 minutes without getting waited on they bickered in front of customers felt like the twilight zone of restaurants at one point the owner sat and talked with another table and we still hadnt been waited on and the restaurant maybe had 5 tables seated we finally got up and left save yourself the time and money this restaurant needs a serious overhauli know what should i expect from a rundown burger king at 8th  market but todays experience was really beyond pathetic   i waited for 20 minutes this morning for my simple order of 2 breakfast sandwiches and hash browns the workers showed no interest at all in helping customers or making food the cashier took an order then slouched off to do something in the back no apologies the line extended to the door   i could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items and frying a small basket of hash browns with the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done   it took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order then i stood against a wall and waited another 10 i watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first when i finally asked if theyd skipped me they said no your order is almost ready but there was no reason mine should have taken longer they were just apathetic half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didnt come when their number was called   after all that the sandwiches were sloppily put together egg hanging out the sides and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside   so if by posting this i can get even one person to avoid this place i will feel ive done my job3rd time disappointed with kelp we were so excited to have a new place to order delivery dinner from my 1st attempt  website said not available  so i called they did not answer so i drove  to kelp to place my order the business  hours on the door said they were open but no one was there after their grand opening 2nd attemp went online to place my orderafter selecting menu items i was prompted to sign in or create account while creating my accountsite went down i called kelp and the person who answered the phone at 831pm said that she would not take my delivery order because it was after 830 tonight was our final attempt at enjoying sushi delivery i placed my order and paid online at 740pm at 920 i called kelp the person who answered said they never put my order in she said they use a 3rd party vendor and in order to process a refund she would need to call the owner she wasnt apologetic and said they got a ton of orders and only have a few driversdisappointed our lunch order took nearly an hour and 20 minutes to deliver and we are only 15 miles away also there was no soy sauce ginger utensils or anything with the order which is weird for sushi place  while they were apologetic about the long deliver time but decent food with bad service doesnt make me want to go back there again if they offer delivery it should be reliable fast and include the sides that you would expect from a sushi place   not a place i would recommend ordering from if you have a busy schedulethis location is supposed to be open until 1 am and i came up at 10 pm and it was closed i think its fair to mention that all of these other reviews are correct in saying that it will take you about 30 minutes to get your food every time you come here the only reason that i came this time was because its close to my house and i was hungry after working all day but of course they werent even open during their normal hourscomplimented the pizza guy cause he looked like the drummer from the roots personally thats awesome id enjoy that but i guess only black people are allowed in that establishment after 3am cause i was kicked out bc they thought we were talking shit low class not worth your timei called to order it was my first time trying blu fig and the guy didnt have time for my questions about the menu he said  ohh are you going to place the order or have more questions because im busy right now  so i guess my business wasnt important for blu figuggh another overambitious tryingtobetrendy food truck im surpised it lasted this long   ive seen it there for years but only ate at cucina for the first time today for fear of overhype my worst fear was true i got the capn crucn tilapia burrito not only does it have nothing to do with capn crunch but something like thing could barely be called a burrito its a wrap with two extemely bland fried patties of fish some salad cold lettuce tomato and cabbage and spicy mayo exactly none of which goes well with eat the others i threw it out after eating half of it and i really dont like wasting food but it was just that badi never liked their food their pad thai sucked im not sorry to learn that they closed i am happy that the location now houses httpyelpcombiznadiasthaiwillowgrove  which had great food at their former digs  httpyelpcombiznadiathailansdalei ordered my food online i walk in about 10 mins after the time it was supposed to be ready guy asks how he can help me i say im here to pick up he says how much i owe i pay him tells me to wait for the food i wait over 25 mins other pick orders wait about 34 mins i then walk up and say whats taking so long they had my food behind them and never bothered giving it to me wont be back they walk past me at least 10 times and no one bothers giving my food i wont be backfor all im about to say i feel i have to mention again that this is an honest review and im not even embellishing much on my experience here ill give them two stars   one extra star because they did something i can appreciate out here in the middle of the usa they didnt try to charge me 8 for a simple vietnamese sandwich you guys have to understand that these banh mi sandwiches are a dollar in asia they are 23 dollars in california but for some dang reason they are 58 in the heart of the usa i ate it up gratefully and happily it wasnt as good as the last banh mi i had which was in se asia mystery meat and questionable cleanliness standards but soooo dang tasty and i felt fine after eating it but it hit my craving spot like a hammer  along with a banh mi was an order of goi cuon spring rolls the rolls were pretty small and the dipping sauce was crap im sorry for not sugar coating but it was absolutely crap like i tasted it and was like dude wtf is this it was bland and the strangest color ive ever seen in a goi cuon dipping sauce it was like a light grayish brown with a less than creamy little bit more watery than creamy diarrhea texture it was a very stupid dipping sauce if people in indiana say i hate vietnamese food i would first blame this restaurant as the prime culprit i would rebut with did you by chance eat at saigon restaurant if this was someones sole venture into vietnamese food i plead for them to try somewhere better and give it another try  the next dish up hu tieu bo kho beef stew with noodles the beef was nice and tender and there were some great bits of tendon and carrot but seriously no real bo kho looks like what we were served the broth should be a rich dark brown with a bit of orange oil highlighting the surface this just looked like very dirty pho broth this is not the beef stew you serve to dip bread in i feel like i was being served counterfeit vietnamese food i think thats why im not happy writing this review   fortunately there seems to be some competition in indianapolis for viet restaurants though i hope that puts some fire in the competition and makes for better quality authentic viet grub if restaurants like this one is killing the first impression to the indiana market there may be no coming back  it gets worse the viet iced coffee tasted like soap i cannot explain it did they not rinse the glasses throughly perhaps it was the viet coffee press that still had dish soap in it what happened there it was nasty  it gets worse ive been around ive lived in a single bedroom apartment with a family of six with a billion cockroaches as a child ive lived in cheap motel rooms with roaches and the smell of bug spray in the sheets ive eaten whole meals in other countries with cockroaches crawling up the wall but for some reason this kinda irked me i saw our waiter at the counter visually tracking a bug on the counter then swat at it with his hand then move things around a bit and try to kill it again in my mind i imagined a cockroach was his victim i watched and watched but did not notice any washing of hands after that hunting trip why were there no towels drying off his hands within the next five minutes why did his hands not seem moist at any time between this occurring and him serving our food like i said im used to bugs i dont like them and they still gross me out but i can convince myself some stuff is okay but why not wash your hands bro take some of that extra soap that was in my coffee and give it a go id really appreciate it a lot im sure the health department would as would the customers it wouldnt take much more time out of your day  i came to indianapolis in search of good asian food that would solve a series of cravings ill keep looking louisville has some great solutions perhaps ohio is where ill look next  im thinking of taking away that extra star yeahi really was hoping this place would have good food at a fair price with good service  the server was nicethe restmehi dont know why you people are all here lying to people i got the fish tacos they are absolutely disgusting is the fish boiled who boils fish for tacos because that is literally what this tastes like irrelevant it is still bland and tasteless also i asked for flour tortillas and i still got corn so thank you for that and then the tortilla completely disintegrates on contact what the heck is happening here biggest waste of money ever and into the trash it goes i guess the hunt for good taco spots in town continuesim not quite sure if these are in new customer relations handbook  rolling eyes when you walk into a empty restaurant because it forces you to work oh and tell your coworker see  slamming sandwiches on the table after you make them as fast as you possibly can  make you wait five minutes to take your order did i mention empty restaurant  make you bag your own carry out did i mention empty restaurant   with love to see the appendix on the training guides at jimmh johns not what i recall in making the customer happy and retaining themthis is the worst wendys i have ever been to charged me for a large cup and gave me a medium because they were out of large wanted a medium cup of ice but got a small even though i paid for a medium total ripoff avoid this wendysi have to say this is the 1st review i have ever made for help and i feel compelled to do so to save diners from getting ripped off the way i did my girlfriend and i stopped by here on a sunday night and were seated right away outside looked nice and was interesting being under the highwayroad above us our server greeted us and asked if this was our first time here we said yes and from that point it seemed like the scam was on my gf ordered a glass a wine and he suggested getting a bottle because they offer it half off on sunday seems like a great deal so i ordered a margherita pizzatasted good not greatand she ordered chicken meatballs it was a bit cold and the sauce was runnyand overpriced so we get the bill and see the bottle was charged for 29 dollars i ask him about this and he said the bottle costs 59 dollars i am certainly not a wine know it all so i decided to check the average price of it the bottle of wine that in riva charged us and other diners 58 was 10 overall the outside does look nice but the food was mediocre at best and this place is a bunch of scammers factor in the smug beer bellied waiter we had and it makes this one of the worst dining experiences ive ever hadif you dine here check the average cost of wine and tell them theyre charging 6 x the cost hopefully this review will deter anybody from getting screwed the way i wasthis used to be an excellent local flavor for college students and the like ever since the move next door it has lost all of its character and has been transformed into one of the most pretentious places in edgehill wait to be seated at a coffee shop are you kidding meterrible service i had out of town guests and took them to bareburger we were a party of 4 when we entered we were behind a party of 2 the party of 2 was immediately seated at a 4person booth while there were multiple tables for 2 available host told us they were just clearing another booth and pointed to it and said we would be seated there shortly in the meantime a party of 5 came in after us it took 10 minutes to clear the table and then another hostess came up to the original host to ask who was waiting for a table he told her our party of 4 and a party of 5 she proceeded to seat the party of 5 at the booth adding a chair to the end of the table there were no other tables let alone booths available for 4 when we told her we were supposed to be seated first she said there was no other place for the party of 5 and it was just logical to seat them there in what world is that logical  we walked out and will not go back went down the block to barra rossa seated within 5 minutes had excellent service  another annoyance at bareburger while we were waiting to not be seated a hostess came and shouted at the several groups of people waiting to move to the back of the restaurant so people can get through has management never heard of customer service trainingdont goits a scam food is awful and is very very very expensive and they dont post their prices three other buffet style places within five miles much better and cheaper they charge little kids big prices and depending upon day charge differentterrible food took 25 minutes to get our food we ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of 2 eggs pancakes were overdone and had almost no blueberries left with stomach aches and disappointmentabsolute joke these people couldnt give a f about customer service pathetic if i could give zero stars i wouldthis review is for take out only i ordered the hot honey chicken it was cold and just okay they didnt trim the fat off the chicken i requested extra crispy french fries they came cold wet and soggy they quoted 45 minutes and the order arrived in 1 hour and 15 minutes dont get take out from here they dont have their ducks in a row yet ill will give them another try but in dining onlywe sat for 10 minutes and were never greeted we ended up walking out after looking around and seeing the staff standing around and not coming bu the table it was not busy it was not during the rush and it was incredibly disappointing we would never come back we ended up going to pomodoro east after which we learned was owned by the same people we were so glad we left and went there the service was night and day do not eat here if you value good service you will be very let downfirst to be honest the food in this place has always been good and the server who brought our drinks and took our order is nice we got here at 535pm we were told a 30 minute wait 1 hour later we were seated  2 hrs later we still havent been served our main course it is now 750pm we are walking out  will never be coming backcan you say gmos msg dont serve to people with valid ids because their staff lacks the training necessary to do their jobthis has to be the worst managed restaurant in the state of missouri i have been here 3 times in the last 3 months and each time was increasingly worse this time i spent 25 minutes waiting inside for my order to be takenit never happened however there were 2 near fights over the quality of service received by four other customers and a worker actually slipped fell hard while trying to make up for the slack of other employees i left when yet another customer approached the counter about an order not correctly filled i wont be back i will however be voicing my opinion of this foolery to anyone who unknowingly attempts to patronize this dumpif i could give this winery a big fat 0 i would this winery is unorganized with an extremely small tasting area one server was chewing gum and flipping her hair yelling to customers who wants to buy a bottle of wine  move to the window yea our server left 3 times to help other customers by leaving the tasting counter to get wine from the cellar took 40 long unpleasant minutes to taste 6 wines  customers lined up to the door waiting for tasting if we didnt pay for our tasting ahead of time we would have leftthe donuts are not good horrible tastes like bread with glaze we gave them multiple chances but they never got any better its a popular place so people tell themselves that its good its notthe place is cute but the owner is rude and unfriendly she was disrespectful towards us  and unaccommodating her behavior toward local customers was unacceptable and detracts from the experience at an otherwise quaint establishment   in addition to her negative demeanor she handled food without gloves and refused to put a lid on a togo cup which was overflowing she then proceeded to throw the lid in our direction and serve another customer   overall it is unfortunate that a neighborhood gem is tainted by her misconductthe last 3 times ive been to this taco bellkfc theyve messed up my order each time 1 they put tomatoes on my crunch wrap supreme after ordering no tomatoes receipt confirmed and they only have us 1 of the 2 crunch wrap supremes we ordered 2 same tomato issue from above 3 gave me the complete wrong order  the worst part was that all of this was through the drive thru so i didnt realize until i was home  failfor the amount of time we had to wait youd think service would be a little better im not complaining about the wait at all we knew what we were getting into but the waitress we had was imcompetant to say the least after we sat down she took our drink order  never to be seen again she came back to take our food order and thank god there was water on the table she brings the food its wrong she brings the check and low and behold charges us for the drinks we never received and is literally mind blown when i ask her to take them off the bill as some one who has worked in the service industry i know what its like to work a busy shift but come onone of the thinnest blandest chocolate milk shakes ive ever had  i should have guessed it would be since they only have a kitchen blender not a real milk shake machine spindle drink mixer  i ended up throwing it out  the store also smelled very strongly of cleaning fluid when i was there on a friday afternoon  it was not very pleasantcountry music blaring i dont like it but understand some might but still took 5 min to be seen in such a small place then ready to order and waited 10 min and since we couldnt even hold a conversation with the music so loud had to leave thank you villaris  for giving a much better optiontheyre ice cream machine is consistently broken during half priced shakes something is always broken or not workingto celebrate my first anniversary with my husband i thought  of sending him a fortune cookie to represent the first year of marriage with paper  since we ate at a chinese restaurant the day we were married i thought this was a great idea to send him a giant fortune cookie with a personalized note they were informative about sending the fortune cookie to my husbands work at decent time to prevent the chocolate cover fortune cookie from melting i was a bit disappointed because i did pay for overnight shipping and had to wait at least 3 days to my husband to receive it i was willing to let that go until my husband brought it home from work at the cookie was not only broken but it cookie itself was burnt i understand the shipping problem since it was to be delivered to california and the fact that it can break while being shipped but for the cookie to be burnt and inedible  of all things it would of been nice for husband to at least enjoy eating the fortune cookiethis place is closed  the signs are off the building  and it looks  like the y are putting up drywall inside  i dont know if it will reopen as  a bk or just office spaceif you eat here with a baby you better hope they dont need to be changed how can a restaurant who serves families not have a diaper changing station  i had to cut my meal short to change  my childs diaper in the trunk of my car in 50 degree weather thank god this was not the middle of winter if it had been i would have changed her right at the hostess stationi decided to try the bbq pork since its convenient  compared to driving to china town  i immediately regret the decision when i opened the box there was no sauce and the slices were thick which brought out the dryness of the bbq pork   the pastries and other selection is great but definitely not the bbq meatmy girlfriend and i decided to meet here for dinner last night a wednesday i was stuck in traffic and she was at katies for 40 minutes before i arrived she said she was seated promptly and courteously but thats where the service ended   in the 40 minutes that she waited at our table not one person acknowledged her no one even filled the water glasses which were empty when i arrived the table was only about 15 feet from the bar where the wait staff was constantly coming and going with food and drink orders it is impossible that no one noticed her  a few moments after i arrived our water glasses were filled bread was set out and we were told our waitress would be with us in a moment after hearing my girlfriends story we decided to give them 10 minutes from when i sat down and in that 10 minutes no one else acknowledged us or took a drink order  so after my girlfriend had waited 50 minutes without so much as a drink order taken we left and went down the street to the wolf where we had a great experience at a fraction of what i would have paid and they only had two waitresses working  i cannot comment on the food but the other reviews of the noise levels are accurate it is very loud and they seem to amplify the sounds of screaming children another issue i had is that the wait staff had no uniforms or name tags or anything to indicate they worked there it was very chaotic   i understand this location is new but im in no rush to return and give them a second chancethis is a really bad establishment overall we found the restaurants decor impressive however this restaurant demonstrates really bad waiter service and probably acts of greed its a disgrace that this restaurant is serving as a living representation of taiwanese culture  first of all the food is decent enough considering that it is away from the bay area which thusly does not introduces competitive taiwanese restaurants if this restaurant were in the bay area the restaurant would be sure to go out of business at the restaurant we ordered stinky tofu and it was unbelievable when we were given only 8 pieces for 5 dollars that equals to about roughly 60 cents per piece that is ridiculous considering the dedication and size of these pieces besides from that we decided that the food is reasonable enough although it was smaller portioned compared to the bay area taiwanese restaurants   the waiter service as mentioned previously is horrible the waiters offered no expression of gratitude for keeping them in employment in addition as we left the waiter offered no thanks and greedily halted his task on hand and searched visually our table for our tips this is ridiculous i understand that the all people want money or else why work the problem is that he doesnt mask his temptations and greed of money and plainly expresses it  the decor in the restaurant is one good aspect of the restaurant i found the restaurant rather comfortable and the television was conveniently angled so then the customers do not need to turn their necks uncomfortably i loved the painting of taipei 101 on the wall as well the kitchen was opened to us and from what i see the kitchen looks pretty clean  the thing that makes me angry at this establishment is the inclination of the waiters to whites opposed to nonwhites the waiter offered better services to our neighboring table of whites however offered less then decent services to us nonwhites we found this consistent throughout the restaurant now i honestly dont care what the reason of discrimination may be but this is beyond acceptablethe experience was a huge disappointment i hate cold food and bad service i experienced both here today our food was cold that wouldnt be a problem except it took 30 mins  for two burgers and a childs grilled cheese my wifes bun was wet liked dipped in water wet and the burgers were below average  i could have even forgiven this if the restaurant was packed but there were only 4 tables taken in the entire building when we were eating   next was the service or lack of service  we had to find and carry our own high chair to the booth seat ourselves and ask for straws and silverware this service would have been bad for a self service burger joint like flaky jakes i had to ask for my check which took a long time and when i looked at the bill total i would have been better off feeding my whole family at steak n shake for 15 less  im shocked that a new restaurant would have servers of this quality when im sure they are trying to break in market these ladies were border line ld they looked so and acted like they were surprised to be working and shocked that customers were walking into the door   this will be the first and last time eating here noting worse than a below average burger from a burger jointextremely poor service and the calzone we ordered was cold and uncooked in the middle and the crust was both doughy and soggy the place was so cold we had to keep our coats on the entire time we were there these folks dont know how to make pizzai cant believe out of 5 guys not one one them had the guts to speak up an say these buns are terribleits good till about 20 minutes after you eat it  i had the breakfast burrito before i moved all day  that was the worst mistake ever  i wont share the details  they are open real early in the morning which is good i guess  however i still would not recommend this placenothing right in this place except they had a clean restroom fries were cold and dark as they usually are i ordered a burrito it took 20 minutes to get it after many people were served in front of me service in this establishment sucks  everything in this restaurant needs to change  they need to train and hire people who truly care about their work they really need to toss out the old food they over cooked and not force it down the throats of their customers french fries beans salads egg taco meat im sure the corporate offices would agree but no one comes out here to correct it i predict if they dont fix these issues soon they will close for a lack of customersi had hoped for authentic mexican food even a spanish flare to mexican  anyway no chips or salsa brought out house margarita was fruity and small and overall non impressive blandartsy flavor    i ordered the chili rellenos  which the server brought out and asked who was having the chili dinner  ive never had a fruity chili rellenos but this one was filled with raisins and pine nuts with very little spice or sauces such as chili verde or rojo    my opinion being raised in new mexico and extensively traveling mexico and spain was that this was an artsy attempt to upsell mexican cuisine     i heard reactions to the enchilada meal as being very coconut heavy in flavor and even a taco bell reference    if you wanted more authentic mexican food id direct you to the closest applebees chipotle taco belland thats not mexican food as wellin out burger doesnt seem to be what they used to be after i got my burger and fries i had to return the fries because they were cold and stiff took a bite of my burger while i was waiting it was cold too almost no meat to those burgers anymore either the help used to be so nice and friendly and polite the girl was snappy and had a bad attitudeemployees try to avoid eye contact in order to pretend youre not there i waited 5 minutes at the counter only to have no one approach me to take my order i departed letting them know that i would put in a complaint no surprise no one got back to me on my complainti was very disappointed to see that the casino is charging 10 to park  i think theyre making a huge mistake  this is by no means a destination or upscale casino   there is really nothing there except a second rate casino  the restaurants are average at best   i read the casinos response to other yelpers commenting on the parking fee  claiming that its to improve security is definitely something i dont want to hear  what casino doesnt make security a number one priority  whether or not they are charging a parking fee should have no bearing on the level of security they are providing to their guestsme and husband went there to have dinner expecting to just have a normal dinner it was completely horrible service was terrible didnt even leave her a tip how bad she was the appetizers came raw and cold and the stakes was over cooked and my  knife couldnt even go to my potato the worst part was the manager didnt even care he was completely rude and horrible he said nothing and just left ill never go back there againthis particular kfc gets one star only because i cant give it zero stars how is it that the last three times ive been here over the last couple months there is no extra crispy chicken youre a chicken restaurant also my container of green beans was mostly water this last time every time i come to this particular location its always something and its always disappointing and on top of that the customer service is always awful it seems the employees are miserable and go out of their way to be rude i kept going to this kfc because i love kfc and its on the way home but never again keyla working the drive through window needs to learn some respect and some manners as well as some customer servicethe slowest at each stop in the drive thru fries soggy it was 630 they should have been fresh poor service like they had trouble counting at each stop too  wont be back any time soon worst experience ever my boyfriend and i  came here for a quick lunch on sunday the waitress didnt acknowledge us until 15 minutes later and when she finally approached us instead of apologizing she said we were last on the list thats why she waited this long very very bad beginning we ordered wraps which they were terrible my chicken wrap had two small pieces of chicken and a lot of lettuce so basically filled with lettuce only gross and the waitress brought one water and said i only had one clean glass really is that what you say  anyways im never coming back i wonder if the owners or managers of this place look at yelp and facebook reviews maybe you should train your servers to be more polite i worked in customer service for years so when it comes to these situations i know when something is wrong  this was the first time i ever tip less than 20listen i love burgers and ive also worked in food service for a long time including food trucks i usually give people a pass i know its hard work but the experience with this truck was terrible the burgers are small and not anything special and very expensive 12 each i believe we waited 30 minutes for our food and it wasnt busy the guy on the truck totally ignored us for quite some time when we finally got our food the fries were cold and soggy not going back   like i said i get it its rough work but not an excuse for soggy fries and a burger that looked like it was stepped oni special ordered a birthday cake with inscription i arrived at the appointed time to pick it up only to see my name being scraped off and another name be inscribed the man in front of me was sold my cake the store offered no discount on a rack cake my birthday party was ruinedhorrible food  horrible service  how do u mess up wendys number 1 meal  drink had soap in it  burger disgusting   fire the kids running the windowsone of the first times visiting santa barbara pier i walked over to this restaurant the sign was outside the doors open when i went in and asked where to order the guy said we are closed miss to which i said im sorry and left as i was walking out this guy started laughing and saying can you believe that lady she thought we were open and laughed so i tried to get back in and the door was locked so i told the guy from the open window that i heard what he said and i thought it was rude his reply was i couldnt believe you thought we were open the chairs were on the table and the door was locked i replied by saying that i walked right in and i had never been here before there were customers eating also anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem he never apologized or anything i will never try to eat here again and let everyone know how rude they are there are many nice places to eat on the pier so whatever you do dont eat therevisited this place while taking a vacation the theme was right and it made me expect something that tasted like pizza from the greater tri state and this just didnt do it for me garlic knots were good but the pizza was just off far off if youre expecting pizza like that it ny or nj dont bother if youre not then im sure its not bad however next time ill just keep walkingthe worst   the egg served on my bagel looked like two giant sponges that were nuclear hot and the bagel itself was like a slab of wonder bread   just repulsive not to mention the line was idiotically longi love cosi food and what they promote far as healthy eating and alternatives while still being tasty i can help but be disgusted that the workers at this location dont wear hear nets this is the food industry have to be clean and use all precautions when handling food they need to enforce hair nets same way you have to wear gloves when handling foodi usually eat at the food bar but will never eat there again and seriously thinking about never shopping there again  a customers dog was standing on the bar licking the food i told customer service and they didnt seem to care  i will share with everyone i know this information  this is a health code violation  animals should not be allowed in places where they have this situation  if i want to eat withvthe animals it should be my choicedo yourself a favor and do not eat here the service is terrible and the employees just dont care i ordered a chicken sandwich was told it takes six minutes to make made me pull out of line and sit there for seven minutes i drive home open bag and no chicken sandwich i go back and they employee goes i know you would be back i say how about an apology none given instead she hands me a sack and says here is your sandwich i drive home pull out sandwich and it is not even warmwtfits another corporate day at this cosi everybody running around doing everything but ensuring the food gets prepared after asking where my food wasi finally walked out onion soup at the midtown 2 diner insteada friend and i went for sunday brunch no wait for a table as there were only about a dozen people dining drinks and food were ordered drinks came out fairly quickly but biscuits  gravy with scrambled eggs and shrimp  grits took 45 minutes to be served during this time the waitress never came to check on us or refill drinks sweet tea  coffee when food was served my shrimp and grits were aweful grits were plain 5 prawns laying on top and a dark gravy around the plate i took 2 bites and motioned for the waitress to take it away my friends wasnt much better we both agreed that we wouldnt returnwhat in the bloody heck is this  after reading some positive reviews on yelp i decided to give phat bites a whirl upon walking in i figured okay its a hipster hippie kinda joint healthy organic vegan inexpensive right  nope dead wrong on all counts upon walking in you just stand in a line no menu nobody telling you what to do or where to go and then when you finally order you are told to order coffee separately wtf  and then you have to wait in an endless line to pay and then you have to wait at your table and wait for your name to be called then to add insult to injury the portions are tiny i literally am on my phone looking for a place to eat breakfast after having just finished breakfast at this joke of a place    so if you are in the nashville airport area and you are longing to pay ridiculous prices for mediocre service mediocre decor tiny portions and middling food by all means come to this joint then we can talk about a bridge in brooklyn i can sell to you for real cheapwow i have never been to a business where the customer service was so terrible first when i ordered the cupcakes i asked if they did a strawberry shortcake kind of cupcake  this was for my sisters bday and she celiac and pregnant cause thats what my sister loves and the girl said yes i asked if the cupcake would have real strawberries in it and on top of it and she said yes so i ordered them i picked up the cupcakes 2 days later and as i walked in to get my cupcakes there were 3 people standing behind the counter talking and no one acknowledged me i had to say something to get someone to help me i get the cupcakes and they look ok i figured the strawberries were on top as well the inside like the girl said but i didnt see any on top ok so i leave and when its time to serve the cupcakes after dinner we cut the cupcakes in half for everyone to try and just as i thought no strawberries then everyone takes a bite and spits the cupcakes out all at the same time it was crazy the cupcakes tasted horrible i couldnt believe it  so i tried to call and speak to a manager and she wasnt there the employee had no clue when the mgr would come in so i called for 4 days straight and still no mgr was around to help me they didnt even know her last name or any other way to contact her i was furious this place is terrible when i saw the bad reviews i still took a chance to try them out well i guess i should of went with the reviews i will never come back to this place again i even have pics to show how terrible the cupcakes were terrible disgustedwish  people who are in the business of selling burgers  would have a great deal more pride in their respective companies and individuals teller in drive tru apparently is not happy  about working nights and in some need of attitude adjustment was not helpful in the slightest came around drivethru for a 2nd order and she doesnt acknowledges that the only vehicle  is there waiting to get food  sat in front of the prompter so long vehicle  2 pulled up waited for a few minutes and drove off angrilyone of the worst experiences of my life horrible from beginning to end after waiting over 30 minutes for my meal i told the waitress to take it off the bill and bring me the check i cant comment on the quality of the food cause i never got it and 3 different waitresses couldnt find it stay awayfood was good but for an 8pm reservation we were given our table 840pm whats even better is that we got a 6 seater for an 8 people table its gets better the hostess told us that she cant ask a 2 seater table next to us to leave so we should hover around them to pressure them to leave expect a long wait bad service from the hostess and good food food worth 4 starsif i could rate this place a 0 i would worst customer services and the employees dont care what so ever avoid this place if you could never againi recently popped into kermits to talk about ordering a birthday cake for my daughter i was told no one there could speak with me and that i would have to email the owner to order a special cakeso i came all the way down here for nothing luckily one of the bakers behind the counter overheard and stepped in she said that she was the main decorator and would be happy to at least talk over the details of what i wanted  she was extremely helpful and even talked me into buying some treats to take home  unfortunately she still was not allowed to take my order or quote me a price that only the owner would be able to do that  oh thats okay when will he be around i asked not entirely sure he actually lives in new orleans  what no sorry i do not think that i will be ordering my cake here  i have never been to a bakery where i was not able to receive face to face help when wanting to order a cake  such a shame because the girl who spoke with me was as much help as she possibly could have been and the treats she recommended were great but to go all the way down there just to be told to go home and send an email is a real turn off for methe only culvers in the country without a veggie patty ridiculous i shant ever stop at that location ever again can i give 0 starsshenanigans is no longer there  burned to the ground a few weeks agoi have been to the chipotle at 126th street 2 times now and each time they have been out of either chicken or steak  i was not there at odd hours and they did not seem in any type of rush to get the food prepared and out  i decided to have steak instead since they were out of chicken the steak was cold and chewy  chipotle has lost some of its appealwe ventured in the store to compare prices with whole foods as soon as we walked in my husband looks at me and our eyebrows raise suddenly  we made a 360 degree turn and left   the place is too dark it feels depressing to be in there even the outdoor night markets in thailand are better lit  how does anybody see in there it feels like a dark alley i had to literally squint  the workers did not seem too happy as well needless to say we will not be back and will stay with whole foodstrader joes and wait for wegemansthe worst kfc around they never get our order right and the manager is so rude the food is good its kfc but because of the staff and manager and the fact we never get what we order we dont go here any more let us know when its under new managementwaiter kind of had a bluntrude tone and my girlfriend and i could see him talking about and looking at us because he was doing it right in front of us i also knew he was doing it because he stopped immediately after we made eye contact with him  i could understand him being annoyed if we were being difficult but all we had done was sit down and order our drinks  ive been a fan of tired hands for a while and i was excited to check out the fermentaria  but this ruined it for meservice was slow which is understandable since its new but the vodka was horrible only thing they had to offer was vodka since they ran out of everything in thursday no biggie ordered a mule read the yelp reviews as i waited and everyone said the vodka tastes like dirt but i figured you cant mess up a mule and the vodka cant be that bad i was wrong they didnt even use ginger beer simple syrup and scweeps was used instead of ginger beer and the vodkawell yelp reviews were right tastes like dirt hopefully they will get everything worked out in the next couple of monthsi was excited to try but was very disappointed beef schwarma was very dry and so old to the point it was curling up from being so dried out chicken schwarma was just shredded boiled chicken breast which was also dry falafel was also dry and dense and not fried fresh  hummus may be  house made but too acidic and not smooth everything was coated with tahini in an attempt to cure the dryness but it didnt help  i also ordered a side of baba ganousch which was meh with too much acid and no smokey flavor and you get a tiny container for 5 bucks really the only edible thing in the platter was the salad   i am usually not picky and will generally eat and like anything but i could barely eat the food i ordered i would say that the generic schwarma carts all around the city are better and they are by no means good maybe they were having an off day because i cant believe that everyone who gave this place great reviews ate the same food i ate today the staff did seem a bit confused back there did something recently change  for now i would say save your money and eat pretty much anywhere elsei got the baked chickenor should i say chicken jerky this measly piece of breast meat was so overcooked the edges were turning translucent i could barely chew through it to swallow they were out of everything when we arrived which made me assume my food would be tasty the black eyed peas tasted like they were just boiled had something weird looking in it maybe bacon but absolutely no flavor cabbage was the same just boiled not exactly sure why we had to wait 20 minutes for food that they popped in the microwave im assuming at one point over the years they served cornbread well no longer my bf got fried fish and chicken it all tasted like flour the mac and cheese was super dry and burnt and tasted like boiled noodles nothing else sweet potatoes are definitely from a can probably why they taste so good in comparison to everything else we only went here because we had a free gift card still wound up spending like 20 bucks wasnt worth the drive we made half way across the city and having to listen to the cook curse and complain about working there made those 20 minutes seem even less fruitful definitely wont be backyea so this place is terrible i dont know when they became famous but it tastes like it was a long time ago floating objects in our drinks some in the original drink brought out and in the one they replaced it with along with lipstick on the brim of the other glass the food was meh crab soup and buffalo shrimp for starters and garlic crabs for the main course oh and theyre kind of expensive dont waste your moneyrarely and i mean rarely do i ever make a review about a fast food restaurant but this is needed to heed warning to my fellow yelpers this is the second time ive been to this kfc and the last time i attempt to give them business one the first occasion they told me my meal would take about 20 mins to complete and all i ordered was a 8 piece with 2 sides no courtesy offered no alternatives asked but today tops the cake i ordered 2 famous bowls after them telling me their brand new loaded bowl which is the main reason i came they didnt have so i settled for normal bowls but was told they would take about 15 mins which kinda took me by huge surprise and in the process of me thinking wether to wait or not the gentleman behind the mic says well is you waiting or not i just pulled off never will be backmy wife and i went there on memorial day weekend to the acme oyster bar to experience the taste of new orleans oysters as they were highly recommended by  friends who would been inprior when i tried to order a dozen charbroiled oysters i was told that there was no one available to shuck oysters are you kidding me memorial weekend and nobody available to shuck oysters also the bartender was a complete beoutch totally unfriendly i rated it one star because nothing worse was available want oysters dont go to harrahs acme oyster bar poorthis place is cute as can be and very historic but the food was awful i did not experience fresh or quality food and neither did my lunch companioni went to eat at this so called great diner the food was disgusting plus we ordered takeout food it was all wrong the order plus i complained and they told me well what u want me to do very rude workers i will never go to eat there again u will not get a vote from me for 2018 worst place to eat tell ur workers to treat there customers with dignity and respect worst 2018 dinerjust tried to go there ordered my food at 805 2 platters she told me 25min so i said okwalked in at 835 she ignored me and after handing out 3 orders and  ohh upon arrival already had 4 customers waiting for over 20min she finally said how can i help you so i told her i called ahead and then she said ohh well its another 20more min so im like you know what  you were stank and service was disgusting i wont be coming back left without anythinghighly dissatisfiedhave waited 25 minutes for my order on numerous occasions store is busy but less so than other locations staff is unfriendly and unapologetici ate 3 pieces of sushi and almost instantly vomited  thankfully made it to the mens room  was there no more than 5 minutes ate no more than 2 or 3 ounces of food and it cost me 2600  told the host the rolls which i ate so he could take them off the bar  no move to remove them no offer of a refund  avoid at all costsi frequent this subway cause its close to my house the place is clean enough and the food was average for a subway restaurant however the older gentlemen who appears to be indian is very cold and unpleasant oh and extremely stingy with the food and toppings he literally sparkled like 2 pinches of cheese on my sandwich and i feel like i was shorted on everything else toowont be going back unless i can help itrude service arrived with friend both of us had coupons woman behind counter said only one of us could use because we walked in together we were counted as 1 guest tried to ask questions she ignores us talking and clowning around with co workers very rude to us and people behind us then to round it off slide bolt breaking in bathroom locked in for 5 minutes before i could get it unlocked no thank youi normally give positive reviews on yelp because i think there is too much negativity in this world however i have not been to a mcdonalds where the employees were more unpleasant indifferent or downright rude food is normal mcdonalds fare but be prepared for employees who obviously dont care about their jobive ordered from uber eats with them before and had great service  today i ordered and they delivered 2 of my orders incorrectly with brown rice instead of white if im going to be paying more for this delivery order through uber eats i expect for them to get it right  instead of acknowledging that they got it wrong  the rep insisted she was right did not offer a refund or a replacement and called me a bitch upon hanging up  i have never had such bad service  never returning againnice place inside but food is way too pricey and service is slow 1st and last time eating here thank you but noooo thank youthid was the worst have been there before  prob 2 years ago thought it would be a nice  inexpensive meal i love chicken rice and beans first of all the man that took our order was rude should have been the first clue ordered the 14 chickenrice and black beans the rice was dry and hard as well as the chicken that was also dry and little meat also had the ice tea sad to say the ice tea was the only good thing looked for a clean table but they all appeared to need a good cleaning neadless to say i will never go there again corporate should check out this store in oldsmar and shake up the staffmy wife and i decide to try the new fridays menu this week and was it awful  i had the roasted marrow  it was a mess two large segments of bone one having a core that was smaller than my little finger with nothing to extract the marrow  i finally got a small spoon but had to use the handle to dig out the grossly undercooked marrow  the other piece of bone had a larger core but it too was undercooked  i havent had marrow before but my understanding is that it is supposed to slide out of the bone  not even close  i had ordered escargot as an appetizer and they had a metallic taste with undercooked garlic in the butter  my wife ordered the shrimp with grits and the shrimp all four of them were tasteless but the grits were terrific  my dish came with a salad which was adequate but not tossed  anyway ill stick to breakfast which i have had before and is quite goodthis was the first time at this location and we put in an online order after we got home and opened our food we realized the guac was old we each got a scoop on our entrees and an extra cup of it for our chips we werent even able to eat our meals because of how grossed out we were the guac which should be a very vibrant green was dark brown i called them immediately to let them know  the gentleman whom i first spoke with and ask to speak with a gentleman told me they were busy but he would get her  really he then came back on and asked me what it was in reguards to so i told him about 3 minutes later the manager picked up and simply said hello she didnt introduce herself didnt appologize for the hold or anything so i then said  hi did the gentleman tell you why i am calling and she said no he didnt so i explained to her again she told me the guac was made last night and thats why it looked that way and that i can come back in for a refund so many things about this expierence and this phone call were so wrong this manager needs to be put through customer service training and if the guac really is made at night that is gross it should be made daily as it goes bad very quickly i will not be returning to this locationi have to admit im surprised by my experience when i saw this place had over 200 ratings and a 45 average i expected something more than what i got  i ordered the falafel platter which came with tabouleh salad hummus mixed vegetables  a side of pita  as a whole everything seemed to be at least a day old everything was very stale and just did not feel right as you attempted to chew it  if i ever storm a castle and have archers firing at me from atop a tower i would like to be wearing armor made from the falafel because i would be unstoppable  the pita i would not serve to small children nor the elderly because its a choking hazard it had the consistency of that fruit leather you used to get from the cafeteria in elementary school   you know how if you put a lot of sugar in your coffee people make that joke you want some coffee with your sugar well thats what they would say about the amount of parsley in the tabbouleh  i understand tabbouleh is supposed to have a lot of parsley but this was to the point where i couldnt call it tabbouleh  they just gave me straight up minced parsley with a countable amount bulgur grains that seem to have accidentally fallen in  the hummus was not that bad it tasted like it had a bit too much lemon juice going on and maybe could have used a bit more tahini but overall it was just ok  the overall taste of everything was not bad but it did not resemble anything that i would call close to good think of a delicious cheesesteak from pats or ginos or dalessandros thats a day or two old  it would taste like its a day or two old but you could still tell that it would have been delicious had it been fresh i cant say that with the meal i just had from smileys  it didnt taste bad like i could not stand putting it into my mouth but i cant say i found it even pleasant id get as excited for it as i would for a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water  i think i rate very fairly and it hurts me that i have to give this establishment such a low rating i will admit that there is a possibility that given the other stellar reviews i may have just had a rare bad experience unfortunately that is all i have to go off of i may try it again some day if im with somebody who really wants to go there  until then no thanksim done with this place  they have a good selection but there employees are infuriatingly inconsistent  when they get a rare item they will lie to your face when you ask for it  friends would get a beer there tell me about then i would go and they would say they never got it in  when i call them out on it then its unsurprisingly sold out  this has happened more than once  one time i came back and tried again and then they had it  i am not giving them my business againok i went here after hearing from several girls i know about how great fresh and wonderful it is  im sure the food is fresh light and delicious to some people but i have to totally disagree with anyone that calls it healthy as it certainly isnt  they do offer lots and lots of nice looking desserts but everything on the menu other than the soups seems very heavy on the carbs fats and sugars here so i think some girls delude themselves that they are eating healthy here just to justify being able to order the super desserts as a reward for their healthy eating if i ate this kind of food ratio often i would be huge  the menu is also a bit on the expensive side for the small portion sizes    they really didnt have anything i liked i love meat but dont eat pig but the soups were decent but not good enough for the price  this is definitely a place for a light lunch  il posto really just reminds me of a coffee shop that decided to throw in some sandwiches but use some quality ingredients to make them a bit fancier  the seating area is tiny and has very little space    i just find this is a place for dainty girls to eat and not men so i will never be back as it just isnt my type of food  if you like this type of food and like light lunches this is certainly a place you might want to check out  if im in this area i will be going to pascals manale or charlies steakhouse instead for my healthy food my pizza was so bad i had to order from somewhere else on the way home just to eat theres barely any cheese on this thing and we ordered it with extra cheese these guys should be ashamed theyve burned me twice now  never againzero stars this place is a train wreck not enough waiters and the food is terrible will be gone in less than a couple months rip bagger faildunedin bagels  deli i picked up bagels here every week  loved them my very first job at 15 was at a bagel shop in nj with new york owners norman  miriam fleischman i know a great water bagel when i taste one however i bought a half dozen cinnamon raisin bagels that tasted like onion the first one tasted like onion i thought that it perhaps came in contact with an onion bagel no problem the 2nd one tasted like onion  i thought then that they didnt properly clean their oven after tasting the 3rd bagel i called them to ask for 6 more well the owner was angry  inappropriate he sniffed each of the 3 bagels that i returned  said they dont smell like onion accusing me of lying really i would have simply apologized  replaced the 6 bagelsthat simple he said you take bite you taste onion you bring back i tried to explain that i thought it might have just been the one bagel he got angrier  forcefully threw the remaining bagels in the trash before handing me a new bag of 6 well he lost a loyal customer for nothing beware do not cross the bossordered a bacon cheeseburger from here earlier today first off it was 10 including the cost of a side of fries which was steep i wouldnt have really cared if the food was good but it sucked the patty was overcooked and was like rubber while the bacon was undercooked also the lettuce was wilted af and they used mozzarella instead of yellow cheese like wtf just terrible i threw it away after three bites and the fries sucked as well i should have went to mcdonaldsmy god we arrived at 617pm ordered and our food didnt show up until 736pmcoldi dont know how other people rated this wendys a 5 because it was horrible we waited 30 minutes to be served and then another 30 to get our food they were out of potatoes and overall just had horrible customer service i understand that this is a fast food place and i am the kind of guy who gets that service at a place like this is always going to be mediocre but i cannot believe how slow they were the bathrooms were also disguisingthis is the very worst with our order we picked to have fries as our side they just handed our food with no side we said we ordered fries as our side she looked at us like we had 3 heads and said well we have none made so we said is there anything else and she said yeah it wont be an extra charge really so we ordered mash potatoes and she hand us a tiny dixie cup size i will never ever recommend this place to anyonethis place has everything but good pastries   patisserie is a cute warm cafe that serves overpriced stale pastries   we bought an almond croissant a brownie and a cup of coffee for 10   the almond croissant was stale and had barely any almond paste in it or rather it had a little on the outside and no paste inside it was not flaky either   the brownie was the right texture of moist brownie but tasted 4 days old and of the refrigerator   the coffee is watery but some people like it that way   i get that its quaint and its local but they really should offer fresh pastries   grossi went to pagoda noodle cafe with four other women after a great time at the july concert and fireworks on penns landing  when we walked in we were asked how many i said five  as we were being led to our tables one of the women with us asked if we could sit at a round table that we just walked past  they obliged  i wasnt feeling well so i asked the gentleman seating us for chinese tea  he said ok and left  then another person came to serve us  she asked if we were ready to order  i sensed an attitude from her right away  nonetheless i place my order which was for chinese tea as thats all i was planning to have  the other women with me were still looking at the menus but went ahead and placed their drink orders  the server then appeared agitated  as she was walking away to get our drinks i asked if there was a problem remember im not feeling well so im not putting a lot of energy or neck movements into my question  she said i asked if yall were ready  you see she wanted to take our entree orders not our drink orders  thats what she meant by ready  when we only gave her our drink orders it frustrated her and she let us know with her poor attitude   now i can take attitude from anyone but any restaurant has a choice to make  they can either give me attitude or take my money  but not both and not at the same time  so we leftused to drive out of my way to come to this location i live closer to the one down 4th st a few times we have ordered our regular steak bowl they barely put any meat or rice i felt like i wasnt given what i payed for regardless of they are busy or not  i wont be coming back due to it being an on going issue they also never have tea or lemonsmany times i ordered a bowl with one entry but what i got was a bowl full of white rice but very little entry this is my firsthand experience i had the similar review on another panda express just because i had the same experience there i will not choose these places any moreabsolutely terrible ordered tickets that was to include dinner we were there for 2 hours and never received our dinner but they made sure we fulfilled the two drink minimum i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone show mediocre at bestcome on your one of the highest grossing casinos and you have to start charging 10 for parking and up your drink prices i appreciate the memories hard rock but not coolwe purchased the 8 piece fried chicken from the deli at 545pm we assumed the chicken would be fresh since it was dinner time wrong  it was the smallest pieces of chicken we have ever seen and it was all dried out one wing was so small that it only had a piece of a bone  one thigh was dried out and was missing the crispy skin it was just a piece of almost black dried meat  we couldnt eat half the chicken it was so bad apparently there isnt any quality control in the deli very disappointingi am writing about the precinct pizza in new tampa owned by the same person last week ordered 2 pizzas one plain and the other with toppings specifically told the employee slightly well done and not too thick when i got the pizzas home they were thick doughy and undercooked not even close to ny style pizza wasted 37 dollars believe me as an italian new yorker this place is awful will never go back the pizza is awfulhorrible service  horribly managed  constantly out of something in the mornings  drive thru orders are often wrong  bad days can be expected anywhere but its constant hereim super sensitive about restaurant hygiene  i cant stand sweaty bartendersservers  bit my lady friend and i didnt touch our good and drinks and we had the food packed to go not to look rude  they should wipe their faces with a towel and bit their hands thats about to handle my food and drinks  this is like somebody spitting in your food pretty much gross the food is not making the review since we didnt even get to eat it  i guess to be fair were very picky with hygiene to where wed like to see hair nets on everybody but sweat dripping from a servers face is unacceptable omg this place defies the standards of fast food longer wait in the drive thru than in the lobby if there was an option for negative stars this location would get itworse mcdonald ever rude employees except the security i dont think the cashier knows what she was doing she couldnt even get my change right our hash browns werent cooked it was still frozen the chicken nuggets were not cooked through the inside of the restaurant smells like crap i will not recommend this place to anyone too bad yelp will not allow me to put a zero starwhats the excitement this place is not at all special  coffee is awful pancakes are equal to waffle house i assume service is crap i fail to understand why there is a line around the block i fail to understand why people come here at allive tried to give this location a chance but every time i come here the baristas are so rude i come here because its closest to my school but i will find another locationthe casino is like any other casino this place is big but my complaint is not with the gaming part but with the rise bakery located within the casino went there with some friends to gamble and we decided to take a break and eat at the rise bakery we had a good server and the food looked ok when it was served but when i picked up the other half of my sandwich i noticed the bottom of the bun was loaded with green mold i called the server over and she got a manager and thats when the fun started they acted as if it was my fault that there was mold on the bread and asked me what i wanted i told them i wanted them to know that they served me moldy bread the jerk they sent to see me was rude and again asked me what i wanted and offered us dessert we didnt want anything but for him to know about the mold he didnt charge me for my sandwich but did charge my three friends for their sandwiches i ate half the sandwich and am surprised that the jerk didnt want to charge me half the price of the sandwich do not eat there any good reviews have to be written by someone they know high priced and lousey foodwere in town for the super bowl and each year try to eat at a local vietnamese restaurant to compare it back home in va  with all the good reviews on pho i decided to order onethe specialty  we also ordered the combination appetizer platter  i am sorry but this is the worst pho that i have ever eaten  i couldnt even finish it thats how bad it is since i always try to finish my food no matter what    i feel bad for the locals since theyre probably never been to bolsa in ca houston or virginia  trust me once you try the pho or even the food in other places theres no way you can come back here and rate this high  but when you hardly have any vietnamese restaurants in indy i dont blame youa word of warning i believe many of the rave reviews fishermans cove is receiving are actually for harbor seafood which is the restaurant next door as fishermans cove is not a dinein restaurant many of the photos posted under fishermans cove feature blue tables and i know for a fact that those tables belong to harbor seafood see my reviewphotos for harbor as further proof   as far as fishermans cove goes i am seriously disappointed if youre looking for good boiled shrimp and crawfish to go i would recommend trying anywhere else i love spicy seafood but this was ridiculous and actually kind of miserable  my fiance purchased 50 worth of boiled shrimp and crawfish for dinner and both tasted of nothing but pepper it obvious the crawfish were not soaked properly  the heads were dry no juice at all and coated in pepper as were the shrimp the only thing we could taste was salt and spice there was no real flavor present missing the basics  onion garlic lemon and a 20 minute soak minimum   we couldnt even finish our dinner what a wastetried to like this place but the owners can be quite rude i have learned our lesson and will be staying away from here i like to support friendlier local businesseswent here for weekend brunch given a 30 minute wait during the peak brunch crowd not too bad the bad came when the hostess dual hatted as the bartender and we had to wait ten minutes staring at open tables before getting sat we were offered free drinks as consolation which was nice but the waiting didnt end there the waitress took forever taking our order and the food took about 30 minutes to arrive after ordering food finally came and there was nothing exciting about it blonde benedict eggs were so undercooked they were clear and fruit was underripe at best sunshine unlimited its an egg sandwich and a pretty crappy one at that it was bland needed salt none on the table and overall underwhelming i would not recommend this place to anyonestay away filthiest restaurant ive ever been inthis place has gone downhill extremely slow service always out of ingredients always get the wrong order probably wont be backblah expensive prices aside which should be implicit by its trendy white friendly location the people they have working here may be the most rude and disinterested people ive every encountered in a grocery market thats supposedly fancy and what have you the kids at the registers just stare at you when you walk in vacant expressions replete within the bunch and the more than likely whatever depleted manager they have on just ignores you and then gives you dirty looks as you leave go to trader joes five blocks away this place is a joke exclusive for those willing to pay four times as much to live in a trendy neighborhoodi dont frequent dunedin very often so instead of dunkin donuts i decide to support the local businesses  well i will never go back here again the lady working was rude and had zero customer service skills she treated me as if i was a burden to her  the bagels were just ok i managed to spend  15 on 3 bagels and cream cheese  dont ask me how  back to dunkin donuts it isi ordered from toppers  2 pizzas one was the buffalo chicken and one was the loaded totzza on 32317 i was so looking forward to the totzza pizza and sorely disappointed other than only ordering bacon on half there were no variations on the order however the pizza arrived with no chives no nacho cheese on top and was only luke warm it can be warmed but no nacho cheese and no chives come on we called to advise them and the manager said he would send another one then nice or a coupon well i had to go to a meeting so we opted for the coupon it is 331  a wonderful dreary day for a tot pizza not sure why it takes so long for a coupon to arrive we still dont have it the ladies i shared this pizza with start a diet april 1 and the management wont allow me to have another pizza on the house is there no way to keep my name and number and address to ensure i dont get 2 free pizzas seems like quite poor customer service i paid 4558 for 2 pizzas delivery and tip seems like there could be a better waydont understand why this place has so many stars i got the simple burger i believe and my boyfriend had the burger with the bacon forgot the name but both of us are now sick throwing up our meal after coming ill after our meal i decided to come onto here to see how the ratings was and it seems some other people have also gotten sick here too i personally would give it 0 stars i did not enjoy my meal due to the rudeness i have encountered since the minute i stepped foot into that establishment it just made my dinner with my boyfriend pretty bad due to neither of us wanting to be there from the attitudes we were receiving from the the hostess and our waitress wont be returning and i would recommend for you not to even check this place out go to five guys or any other burger establishment and save yourself some money and possibly a very rough trip to the bathroomwent there for lunch before they moved locations and myself and husband were pretty impressed  just think about how excited we were to hear that they were now open for breakfast at their new location   we visited there on a sunday morning for breakfast  husband isnt home that much due to work so we wanted to enjoy a sit down breakfast together before running our errands for the day and thought we would try out the new breakfast menu belgian waffle with side of bacon for me and disco ball for my husband  walked in to no line at all and placed our order at the counter  went around to pay grab our fruit tea and took a seat  we looked around and noticed what appeared to be a couple people im assuming at this point ordered food after their group did  didnt really think anything of it  after approx 20 mins my name is called they put my belgian waffle down no sign of side of bacon and tell us that my husbands meal is right behind them  my husband didnt want my food to get cold so told me to go ahead without him  i ate my entire waffle and he still didnt have his food  plates were slowly making their way from the kitchen to the other peoples tables my husband still waiting for his  i finally go to the counter and ask about his plate  they hand me a plate that was sitting on the counter and says breakfast takes longer to cook  ummmmmmmmmok  they didnt seem apologetic in the slightest even though i told them that ive already finished my breakfast  i took his plate to him and went back up for my side of bacon  he literally finished his food before my side of bacon was brought to the table  his food was cold and the look of the meat on his plate was questionable  the quiche was pretty good though  needless to say our planned nice sit down breakfast together turned out to be far from our expectations which included a price tag of 30  if you go for breakfast and plan to eat togetheryou may want to take a snack to eat while others in your party enjoy their plates one by oneterrible experience waited over an hour for our food when the restaurant was empty then waited an additional 45 minutes to get the check we asked them to split our check four ways like it says on the menu and gave a written breakdown of each check the waitress came back with one large check after we gave her a breakdown of the bill twice then she proceed to complain about having to divide the checks we asked for itemized copies several times and never got them good food but terrible experiencejust walked in and the clerk was on the phone the whole time we were inside bitching and continuously using profanity as we were walking out we were asked rudely if we needed help like we were an inconvenience to him wont be stopping in here anytime soonthis is my local market but i will gladly drive the ten minutes to go to the shoprite in delran the willingboro shoprite is old it doesnt have all the updates as the one located in delran its more of a convenience store than anything if you need a loaf of bread or milk or some foil pans run in but if youre looking to do some major grocery shopping i suggest you take the ride  do not eat here first of all it took them about 3 weeks to fix their drink machine secondly my coworkers and i got sick from eating here all on separate occasions i feel like the employees there were not trained well too they cant really make a good sandwich i opened mine up and the meat fell everywhere maybe consider some better training and a quality of food check up i generally like subway but this one has made me sick on multiple occasionsordered 2 coffees and a muffin got one coffee and the muffin 20 minutes before the second coffee watched people who came in after me get drinks while i continued to wait for the second coffee  how do you give half an order to someone and then make them wait for the rest while the first one gets cold  this is not the first time this has happenedcame here a couple months ago after finding out our favorite mexican place closed down ordered a burrito some tacos kids quesadilla and some gauc n chips  burrito is seriously overpriced for what you get  flavor is about average but youre essentially paying 9 for a taco bell burrito with a side of rice and beans im totally ok with taco bell style burritos but they shouldnt cost more than a a few bucks  tacos were mediocre and also overpriced  gauc n chips were ok because im pretty sure its impossible to mess up gauc  i dont know if this is accurate but it felt like the cooks in the back have no culinary education or skill  the food felt like what youd make in high school before you learned how to actually cook well  maybe they are a bunch of high schoolers and no one is actually quality controlling the dishes i really can only guess  suffice it to say we wont be coming backi actually use to work here years agofor three weeks its a horrible place the owner doesnt care about anything at all and i dont think the manager ever took a shower and always smelled of bo all the time there is a lot more about this place that im not gonna get into all im going to say is keep driving another 5 minutes down the road to ddi just got back from chucks and had to login to write a review i was optimistic going in because chuck is from texas and from his social media posts and menu i got the sense that his food would be solid unfortunately i couldnt have been more wrong   i ordered the two meat platter  brisket pulled pork mac salad and potato salad along with an order of original wings and the only thing remotely good about the entire order was the jalapeno cornbread the brisket and pork with both extremely bland with absolutely no smoke ring or smoke flavor in fact they tasted boiled i cant understand how this could be if that meat was in fact inside a smoker   the two sides were both bland as well i looked hard and couldnt see any spices in either of them i then moved on to the original wings again the meat was bland with no seasoning and what tasted like a bottled bbq sauce no smokegrill flavor whatsoever    im at a complete loss for how a bbq place with a pitmaster from texas could serve up food like thisdropped in here one night with my wife about 15 minutes before closing time as soon as we walked in the barista hard for me to call her that was seated at a table and was obviously not happy that she had to get up to serve us she forced a grin and asked what we would like my wife ordered a caramel iced latte and i ordered an espresso being that i love buddy brew coffee i was happy to see that was the coffee they used she then asked my wife if she wanted sugar in her lattewait what red flag no good coffee shop asks patrons if they want sugar added to their drink  they should want you to taste the coffee it would be like going to ruths chris or mortons and having them ask you if you want a1 sauce for your prime steak anyway my wife declined and a few minutes later we were served our coffees my espresso was sour because the double shot poured way too fast under extracting the coffee my wife who isnt the coffee snob i am and drinks dunkin  starbucks took a sip and gave me the look of yeah this isnt good  we walked out of the shop and my wife immediately said i cant even force this down and threw her drink away what a waste of money this barista figured out how to take good freshly roasted coffee and ruin it i hope the issue is isolated to her and based on the other reviews here maybe it is but we will not be back120 minutes from arrival to food is simply not acceptable  if waiting 80 minutes for food isnt your thing dont make other plansvery disappointed with the experience i had last evening my friends and i decided on a girls night that began with dinner at friendlys and ended with a movie close by we ordered our food at 6pm so we could leave by 7 for a movie that started at 720 none of us ordered anything fancy chicken fingers a wrap a sandwich at 650 our food finally came and we quickly had to scarf it down in order to leave we did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner there was only 5 of us this was extremely disappointing even though they offered is boxes to take with uswhich honestly we couldnt even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours    we expressed our disappointment to the manager who never even looked up made eye contact or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience all she said was i gave you a little something off which was 150 off the entire check it wasnt even the discount that irked me we were looking for someone to validate and at least pretend they were concerned about our experience and even that was too difficult to do   i would just eat at the theater or head to red robbins if youre looking for a quick bite to eat apparently the fry times for friendlies chicken fingers fries etc exceed over 20 minutesok the picture of that hamburger was exactly how it tasted i dont think i ever had a hamburger that was as bad as this one i sent it back and i wont be back 711 has better burgersall i can say is stay away from this place i waited for half an hour for my server to get my order and the silver plates show that they are not cleanit took 15 minutes for her to make a milkshake she started restocking toppings while holding the milk it doesnt take that long and she definitely wasnt in a rush sat down and still she moved so slowly should have just left and driven to the one across town would have been quicker she then let my shake sit and it was warm once i got it and only 34 fullfood is okay assuming you dont mind waiting ten minutes for the server to take a drink order and more than 45 minutes for food and they werent busy this is the same experience weve had ever time weve been here but this is the last time manager came out and was worthless blaming it on them wth isnt that you not staffing sufficiently pretty pricey for portions too weve gone back because its our end point when we get off the katy trail but next time well head over to trailhead would not recommenddear mary the owner im very disappointed   i came here on sunday feb 11 at 511  friendly counter person  i asked for a dark roast to find it was not ready  to be accomodating i said id try the last of the medium roast i tried and found it to be not hot and didnt taste right  but that same previously friendly counter person replaced with a small instead of the 16oz i paid for  he refused to replace because he did a pour over   im disgusted   i left the coffee behind  ill not be backhad been curious about freddys after seeing them pop up around town well not so any more not my favorite burger tasted like charred meat onion rings extra crispy were good dipped in the fry sauce  half our order was messed up somehow which the manager attributed to the computer screens messing up   what was most disturbing though was how filthy the place was the tables were all greasy and had clearly been cleaned with greasy rags the floor was dirty and very sticky it was disturbing to see that the floor was being mopped with a swiffer and food on the floor was just pushed to the side  i really wanted some custard because the taste we had been given was really good but after watching the water on the dripping rag being slopped all over the machine we decided not toterrible service on our visit here on 05162015 server name lyndel waited for my strawberry shakes for 45 min and when we ask for it she said still in the process of making them and unlimited fries still in the fryer this is our third visit and to my dismay this is the worst server we ever havei feel like you have to try to screw up orders as bad as they do not only that but we had an experience once when i was there with my 2 kids and 2 employees were screaming at each other they were cussing and finally one left i got her name and called corporate to complain never heard back next time we went in we always went before psr on wednesdays that employee was there again i cant believe she wasnt fired for screaming and cussing in front of kidsliked blue bell pizza the first time went there tonight because i read the wings were good and thats what we wanted my husband had to wait 30 minutes longer than quoted he got home and they forgot part of our order i called and the girl was helpful and nice and said they would deliver it right away 45 minutesnothing i called back and there was confusion but they tried to deliver to another house no call nothing the girl offered a credit we arent going back so it doesnt matter in a town with a bunch of decent placesits just not worth iti have been to this applebees a dozen of times and had average servicefoodetc recently myself and a friend had boneless wings and experienced incredible pains overnight in our stomach followed by sickness the entire next 48 hours upsetting because we usually like the wings be careful of the larger ones as they seem undercooked service was okay but the experience will keep me away from this location for quite some time hopefully no one else experiences thisthe worst greek food i had ever eaten the octopus was burnt and chewy the rice flavorless the cod was raw in the middle and the salad saggy i even got sick from it yep i got a bug the must have left the salad outside for a while the bread was terrible it was hard and cold good thing i dont have dentures the bakery was the other joke i got a tiramisu which it wasnt even close to be one it was some kind of cake trying to be a tiramisu the baklava was brutal super sweet which tells me they did not used honey this place is definitely for tourist or americans who really dont know anything about greek foodwho knows how the food is weve been waiting almost an hour and havent received it yet the waitress said theyre busy but people have came received their food and left since weve been here well after an hour wait we left easily the worst experience in new orleans  they should be ashamed of themselvessat down at the bar and nobody even acknowledged us for 10 minutes so we left  bartender was right in front of us and not busy at alli walk into the store to buy a bottle of water and it was this asia lady in their she was discriminating against me she told me the bottles of water in her store was warm and i told her its fine i would still like to buy a bottle water and then she told me her store closed after she told me her store was closed i decided to walk out the store once i left out i noticed she allowed this white woman to walk into her store so i confronted about her store being closed and then she had the audacity to tell me that was her friend so i told her thats wrong cause this white woman randomly walked without even speaking a word to you and you telling me your closed thats straight up wrong unfair and mess up and i walked away  a little after that situation i have walked past the store again and noticed another person inside the store which was an asian man sad to say this but discrimination still exist and i am a young productive black male and this really made me feel sad and unimportant to not be able to buy a bottle water based on my racethis is the second time my husband and i have come to josefs  expressly to get an assortment of cookies  so i cant speak on behalf of the meals they serve  just before the holidays we came in to get a dozen cookies since they were just for my husband and i i thought even 12 cookies was extravagant there was only one gal behind the cash register helping a short line of customers the service was very slow when our turn came i mentioned that i wanted just an assortment of cookies immediately the gal tried to hard sell me on the premadeup platters of cookies that were heaped on a large table in the entrance area i kept saying no thats too many but she just wouldnt listen and kept telling me that this assortment was ready to go   when i finally got her to listen to me  the customer  i told her i wanted just one cookie from each line in the top two shelves of the display cabinet over and over and over and over i had to repeat this ridiculously simply request even my hubs was wondering if the gal understood english she kept asking what we wanted and then 15 min into putting some of the cookies into a box i said so what have we got here and she said ive got 5 cookies  what else did you want seriously it was like some kind of skit on snl how difficult is it to grab one each of six different cookies on two shelves we got the cookies and i have to admit they were delicious i think cookies and probably cakes  pastries baked at the holidays are bound to be good and fresh because of the turnover  flash forward to yesterday we returned with a sweet tooth to get just six cookies for us one gal behind the counter was on the phone as we approached the cash register she remained on the phone a couple of minutes with no greeting whatsoever then hung up and disappeared in back um ok anyone home after waiting 5 minutes a different gal came out to take our order this time we got the cookies we asked for and went home to try them horrible   we took a bite from 4 of our 6 cookies purchased and found they tasted like rock hard sawdust i am not kidding i bake cookies myself and i know that when you bake them fresh  daily  they should be moist and tender yes they look pretty all dolled up in frosting and daubs of jam but the flavor is absolutely flat  not a hint of butter or sugar in them i guess they use lard i also suspect that the cookies stored under the hot lights of the display case are not only dried out beyond repair but were probably baked a good week ago i broke a cary cookie in half and it just shattered like glass the cookie was dry as a biscotti and tasted like some kind of stale dog biscuit   these cookies are an insult to josef if he is even alive and cares what is baked and sold in his store we will not be returning to josefs again for any dessert of any kind ever i was so mad about these stale biscuit cookies i chucked them all in the garbage money down the drain   you may as well get a small cookie or two at whole foods or even a small box of infinitely fresher cookies at trader joes josefs socalled vienna bakery is a total fakeryi have been to this starbucks multiple times and everytime the same thing happens they make drinks out of the ordered in which they were received this last time was my absolute final straw with this location the woman behind me had order 5 drinks and had gotten all of them before me as well as the 3 people behind me when i asked if my order had made it through because the people behind me had gotten their orders the man behind the counter said oh yes it is right here is is coming up well 3 more orders later again from people who order after me i finally received my iced coffee and it only took 20 minutes to get i would definitely advise anyone to purchase from a nearby starbucks rather than this onethis restaurant failed to proceed my order 2 times at took 15 minutes to make my foodyelpers have seriously dropped the ball on this one i just wasted an hour and a half going to this place only to be served a shit ton of dissatisfaction first they flat out lied to me that they could not validate my restaurantcom certificate my bad i guess i shouldve listened to the one yelper that shared the same experience dont bother ordering 10 shrimp tacos the shrimp are flavorless and the soft corn tacos were an abomination that i really dont know how to describe properly i had heard such great things about their ceviche so i decided to order the campechana it is now sitting in my refrigerator until i figure out a way to salvage the shrimp from that disaster the octopus is a total loss though if you dont know how to prepare octopus without turning it into shoe leather  do not serve it at your establishment i honestly feel embarrassed for these people im pretty certain its generally a bad idea to throw some seafood in a cup with a bunch of ketchup and sugar and have the balls to think that its ok if i could give negative stars i would i hope this place shuts down the only positive is that my senior citizen relative enjoyed the asada burrito if she had been disappointed i probably would have written a much longer review of this nightmare it is a disgrace to food trucks across this great nation save your money and ffs dont support this madnessi literally just came home for the burgerking marlton location i wanted to try the new chicken sandwich i opened up the sandwich and it looked disgusting it was small burnt some of it was black and dry i decided to pull it apart and try it it tasted even worse than it looked this is bad i had a horrible feeling driving up to this location as the road conditions were horrible and it looked as if they were closed i should have went with my instincts i will never go back to this locationordered a 12 chicken combo in drive through  get to window and they wanted confirm a 14 piece chicken combo which they said they did not have  clarified that the order was a 4 piece half chicken combo  ran my card for 14 when the order board said 870 price  i questioned and they said our prices went up  yesterday  she did not care what the price said  asked for the store manager assistant came to window also stated price went up and didnt care and even argued  she agreed to call the manager for the stores in carson  came back and said we can refund the money or you have to pay the higher price  horrible the training and operations management  avoid this location at all costsmy boyfriend and i walked in one day and we wont be going back to start off the huge place was empty which shouldve been our first red flag and menu items are wayy overpriced 7 for a smoothie i can see if it was organic fruit but for a normal ice cream and frozen fruit smoothie am i missing something  i get the soft serve is supposed to be more healthy than your regular old soft serve but when i asked if it was all organic like the sign said the girl told me no just the flavoring was sorry but i think ill go elsewhereate here for the first time this weekend and i can honestly say it was pretty bad and tasteless i know this place has been here for a very long time and the owner works hard to keep the place running but what i had from the dinner buffet was not very good there was sweet and sour sauce on the buffet but no chicken balls were offered in the buffet on this day i guess it was there to maybe put on the bland white rice they called fried rice i have had chicken and beef fried rice many times in my life and there was no way that was fried rice more like warmed upsteamed plain old white rice that was clumpy and hardly had anything in it there was no vegetable in the rice i honestly dont know what that was i tried the ginger beef and it was way overly spicey and soggy the egg roll was soggy as well and seriously had nothing inside it besides bean sprouts that tasted really bad not what i would call an egg roll i tried the fried chicked that was on the buffet and that was pretty good overall i was disappointed though and will not go backfirst visit today super small lobby not enough seating the seating they have is overly fancy and impractical   prices were good simple menu  burger was mediocre pretty much whataburger quality onion rings were good touchscreen soda machine is slow and annoying they filled my cup 34 full of ice no napkins or condiments in lobby very bad design  tons of staff but they were more in the way than helpful they mostly just goofed around they were training employees and wasting the limited lobby seating  overall i think this place will be closed by the end of the year this might of cut it in new mexico but we have too many good burger options to settle  tl dr dont waste your time go to five guysive been to dners several times and the food isnt super bad but coming from germany i am german and grew up there the dner there is extremely bland and boring the sauce which is the best part for me in dner stores is completely tasteless the meat was very dry and hard to swallow the person working there was nice but didnt listen to anything i said and put things on my dner that i didnt want even though i repeated myself 3 times  they also do not have onions which are very traditionally on every dner anywhere else in the world their own picture even has onions on it they only have a oniontomato mixture which is disgusting to someone like me who doesnt like tomatoes  and no ac either in florida  lastly the price usually anywhere else a dner is about 6 but not here they are trying to be super expensive with 17 for 2 and mine only had sauce and very little meat on it i guess those prices are not going to the missing acneedless to say a waste of your money and id never go back there againhorrible horrible horrible never go here my husband 2 kids and i went to the drive through because we had gift cards the ordering was fine then we were in line for over 30 minutes and stuck because there were cars in front and behind of us also there is a concrete barrier on either side of you so while we were waiting we saw food finally getting handed to the people in front of us i saw what my son had ordered and even commented to my husband that i bet that was my sons food it was a tall truck so we could see what the people in the cab were doing we saw them go through the food they went through everything then handed everything back through the window i saw the worker set the food down on the counter finally that customer got their food when it was our turn  we drove up to the window and the worker handed us that same food the same food that had been sitting there for the past 10 minutes and that was in another persons car and other peoples hands had gone through i said i knew it was old food and i saw what he had doneso he yelled and huffed at me needless to sayi drove off i will not ever go back there disgustingwhat is going on with this place always shortstaffed and remaining staff is surly in the weekday mornings today sunday i went there after church and theyre not even open handwritten sign on the door says sorry open at 1000 disappointingwent there for lunch and the place must have changed owners and chefs the food got bland and the staff has been replaced with slow and sloppy staff our waiter brought me a cup of water with a tiny rock and spilled sauce all over my backpack   the sandwiches are still a good deal but the vermicelli bun bowl is mediocre i will now be returning therei tried to call in an order to go and was decline to do so because they no longer take call in orders after 11 and when i asked when did this start he said a few months back very disappointedyou have got to he kidding since this new owner has taken over alot of people will not go in here its now dirty   what a shame it was an awesome place before  not nownot impressed at all all the sides tasted like they have been sitting there for days the brisket was 50 fat and the ribs were dry 36 for ribs and 3 sides absolute waste of moneyjust utter crapwe have frequented blue moon pizza for many years and have noticed the quality has gone way down from what it used to be the last two times we have found the pizza leaves a lot to be desired last night we had our usual pizza to go and it was way over done the crust was burned in some spots and tasted like burned toast the shrimp was tough and dried out the cook was too busy flirting with one of the female workers and chatting with another and wasnt paying close attention to what was in the oven will not be returning to blue moon but now we need to find another local pizza place with quality pizza will check the reviews on yelp to find a new one to try5 tacos and nachos missing tomatoes and sour cream must have ran out of food not goodwe went here for dinner and drinks because someone gave us a gift card  i was really excited to go  the building is super cool and the location is pretty awesome  this place has all the potential in the world  however the food is ok at best and the beerits horrible  theres no other way to put it  reno has a lot of good beer but not from the depot  pretty sure i have 30 left on a gift card that just wont get used  if they had good beer id go with 3 stars  but i cant give them a good rating just because the building is coolthis is the worst the ice cream is melty it melted all over my new adidas pants mind you it stained the costumer service is terrible she didnt know witch ice cream was witchvery disappointed the pictures on yelp are misleading as the dont offer mac  cheese on regular menu and much of the items are not on menu the first two beers my husband order they did not have we had the peppers for an app and they were good the depot burger was very disappointing  the pastrami was very fatty and seemed undercooked  the chicken sandwich was okay not bad bit nothing special my son had the classic burger and wasnt impressed the worst part was getting change it took over 20 min to get bill then another for change its a 100 billhow hard is that to break then waitress goes miavery frustrating to say the leastcashier tanya was rude i asked for pepperoni pizza she said we dont have any i said thats okay i can wait for the next one thats made and she seemed perturbed that i didnt just take what was available when i got to the counter and bought a soda and paid in advance for the pizza that was not yet made she said you can pay for it when its done  then i asked are you going to make me wait in line again and she rolled her eyes and just let out a gasp she refused to wear gloves when making the pizza when i asked her why she wasnt wearing gloves she said she didnt have to in tn and that she had just washed her hands i didnt see her wash her hands the time i was there terrible service she shouldnt be allowed to deal with the public she seemed unhappy in her line of workvisiting from la thought it would be nice to pick up some pastries for friends showed up at 603 plenty of people were in the cafe and the lady at the door wouldnt let me in i asked very politely if i could just grab some pastries which i received a reply of no i cant let you in pretty lame for a 600 close to say no to a patron at 603 there was no one else behind me either not like it would have kept a crowd coming inwent to dinner last night and noticed the chicken was undercooked red and raw after eating a few bites  manager gave our party two 10 dollar vouchers for our next visit and took off the app  i dont think this did justice  we ordered the chicken and waffle sliders  no one enjoyed their entrees  the vouchers will be going towards a beer sampler if and when we go back next timei love paradise but this is the worst location the place is filthythe employees clearly dont want to work and take forever all while giving you attitude theyre somehow low or out of every ingredient the whole salad that i ordered was the size of a half the casher even had to ask if it was actually a whole i could go on but just avoid this place the paradise at hamilton town center is so much better its like theyre not even the same chainat one point in time the foodery was the only place to go for mixed sixpacks of good quality craft beer the times however have changed rapidly the foodery has not  this foodery still hasnt decided whether it wants to be a bodega or a bottle shop which in a store that small means that theres not a lot of room to walk around once you get more than 5 people in the store youre literally pressed up against each other as you try to open the fridge doors if you go before 4pm youll have room to shop but the staff the works during the day dont know shit about beer including one woman who doesnt drink beer at all the night time staff is more on the ball  there are literally dozens of other bottle shops now that have better selection and lower prices beer heaven beer love the bottle shop pennsport beer boutique the beer peddlers etc so its not worth it to pay the extra 510 per bottle unless youre really really lazy its especially galling when you consider that they own their own beer distributor global but are still overcharging youthe food is fine and the drink menu is better lots of filler in the burritos  rice and beans  nowi just saw one of the kitchen workers use the bathroom and walk immediately back to the kitchen without washing his hands   enjoy the e coli burrito i hear itll run right through youthis location is compete trash i have given  them more chances then they deserve every time i go there they mess up my order forget my order and if you need a stir stick or napkin good luck because once they give you for drink they ignore youi had been to pagoda a few times with only great things to say about the food particularly the cold sesame noodle and lo mein i hadnt been there in over a year and thought id check some recent reviews to see how how they are doingwow was i sad to read that the place has utterly went downhill i didnt want to believe that so we went for the lunch time special to give it another go   well folksthe reviews dont lie   very sad in there now  we were the only people in there on a friday during lunch the walls inside are falling apart and the seating was duct taped in places eek the cold sesame noodle was dry with no sesame in sight tasted a few days old and was very unappetizing looking i thought i saw mold on a noodle but i cant confirm if it was or not  either way i didnt eat it the entrees came out hot but nothing to write home about  they changed their noodles for the lo mein which was one of the reasons we go there the sauces were flavorless thank god we got the cheaper lunch special because no way in hell does this place deserve to charge regular menu prices for sub par food we wont be coming back to our once favorite lunch spot anymore and that makes me sadextremely disappointed at this place over the weekend they offered summer drinks as part of their specials but they were out of the raspberry then we ordered a pina colada instead but they didnt have the mix for that either we each ordered the prime rib and got mashed potatoes with it when i tried to send mine back for a baked potato i was told that they dont serve baked potatoes on sunday i also wanted creamed horseradish and was informed that they might possibly be out of that as well so i asked for sour cream to mix with the straight horseradish by this time the bartender subbing as a waitress was becoming visibly agitated with my persistent requests  i was planning to order 2 additional prime rib dinners to take home to my husband and soninlaw but i wasnt about to give this place any more money for their poor choices and now an attitude from a food server  so i phoned in my order to the outback steakhouse where for the same money we got our choice of potatoes and choice of vegetable and we also got warm baked bread1st time there havent eaten at one since they had one in miami which was horrible and closed down i was not the least bit impressed had to wait too long for a bottle of perrier while my bf was already on his 2nd coke we got the appetizer tower it was decent the sw egg rolls were good the chicken tenders were rubbery my boyfriend a 64250 lb healthy eater ordered the red white  blue 10 0z burger looked aazing in menu not so much looked like 4 oz didnt even come close to filling bun a few mishappened crumbles of bleu cheese and an onion ring blech he couldnt even finish it he never ever wastes food he just didnt want anymore it was that pathetic i ordered eggplant parm was so excited reading about the celebrity chef inspired dish first they brought me the meatball sandwich oopsy how does that sound similar to eggplant parm then i had to wait another 10 minutes while m bf picked apart his awful burger for my correct dish to arrive the sauce was good the mozzerella was high quality fresh mozzarella but the eggplant was greasy overfried and tasteless nothing like the menu description promised wasnt even garnished with fresh basil like the menu said i ate a little luckily my bf enjoyed it way more than his pathetic burger no apology nothing comped no nothing so unimpressed the place was almost deserted too no excuse for this place to be that awful definitely overpriced will never go backi am a regular customer at remedy however this location is horrible they dont have enough staff in the back to get peoples order out i ordered and waited 30 minutes just for a take out the worst part is three people behind me had their ordered filled and mine was probably sitting in the back the lady didnt even apologize she just said we are busy but there was no line up frustrated going to a better remedy location  avoid the attitudeon recommendation of hotel staff we ordered pizza  extremely disappointing pizza was a lot smaller than expected due to its oval shape we ordered 2 large pizzas 1 well done with extra cheese apparently  their pizzas are made without pizza  sauce  the extra cheese that we ordered was non existant  the cheese that was on it was a orange cheese the under crust looked  tasted undercooked bland  tough i should have checked yelp reviews before wasting almost 40 on this placeworst orange leaf havent been to this one in years but decided to give it a shot same not flavorful froyo almost too cold to taste anythingwe had some catering ordered by our company from this restaurant it was baked ziti with cheese and meatballs with garlic knots the garlic knots were alright and their pizza may be good as i havent had any i cant comment what i can say is that there pasta sucks the meatballs taste like they just bought them at a store and stuck them on top and they used almost no pasta sauce like 3 cups per 10 lbs of pasta wouldnt eat it even though it was free certainly wouldnt spend any money therewe came here all the time after they opened but the service just keeps getting worse  sorry to say it  its time to switch to switch to besitolocation has been closed for monthsvery disappointed i looked online at the krispy kreme menu and figured out the assorted dozen i wanted with my girlfriend i go to this place and like nothing is there ok  i understand some sound a bit more specialty like chocolate iced raspberry filled double dark chocolate cinnamon apple filled and powdered blueberry filled but they literally didnt have any powdered sugar donuts at all no maple glazed anything no lemon filled anything and when i commented about them not having much i got attitude back from the girl behind the counter telling me they had everything except for maybe one or two donuts its one thing to not have many routine donuts its another to have bad attitude but to have both one star it isi come here every year on my annual road trips to florida because gas is cheap at the flying j and it amazes me that every time i come it takes them forever its mcdonalds people not a gourmet meal there is nothing fast about it pretty sure i could get a meal at cracker barrel next door in the time it takes them to make my number 4 sausage mcmuffin meal the slowest service i have ever had at a mcdonald and that includes the south where they typically move super slow to give you an idea im writing this review while im waiting in line and still havent even ordered what gets me is that it is every year i keep waiting for them to get better one year but it never happensabsolutely pathetic drive through times i live near by and every single time im in their drive through i wait no less than 15 minutes and have spent 30 minutes more than once once youre in their drive through youre trapped and cant leave due to their barriers  do not go here unless you have a lot of time and want to waste itoh your food is good but not great enough to get a receipt thrown in my face  i normally come during lunch when im at work and service is fantastic but this time i wanted to bring my husband to try the burgers and came at night i was so excited but then it turned into a disaster  i ordered the turbo burger again for the husband and i to split along with some fries paid with levelup and then she gave me the receipt upon looking at the receipt i noticed that she charged me for a burger that doesnt even exist even the cooks questioned it she was like oh i charged you the wrong burger and prepared the refund process of the overpayment she only gives me a receipt with no money back i asked her wheres the refund she stated it was going to go back on levelup wrong i have paid with levelup tons of times to know that your computer system and levelup are not connected to one another whatever you ring up on the computer you must also do on the payment syetem she stood there arguing with me then took money out of her drawer and the receipt i gave back to her and threw it in our faces and yelled saying now her drawer is going to be short i requested for the manager and she stated she was the manager husband was furious that he said to cancel the whole order and refund our money again refused to give money back for it but then eventually did  btwi still have not received a credit back on levelup im still charged if i do receive the credit ill be more than happy to go back and give cash back to her  service is a big part in my dining out esp bc ive been a server before i started my career for over 7 years so this one really took the cake ugh she needs retrainingvery rude manger prices are exaggeratedbeen going there for 2 years food is a hit or miss never taste the same plus the min credit card purchase of 5 dollars even after i just purchased  25 worth of food the manger would take my card when i wanted  to add a 2 item i prefer salems will never go back to zeekosclam chowder tasted like it was from a can old crab meat and recooked corn on the cob oh and dirty bathroombad food ok service dirty place drinks good the service was slow my father ordered tacos the ground beef looked and tasted like it had been days old and no flavor  we also ordered steak quesadillas horrible dried steak with yellow cheese also ordered queso fundido with chorizo  bland cheese and i dont know what they put in it but it was not chorizo   if your looking to taste fresh homemade salsa this is not the place to go it was the worst  tasted like they opened a can of stew tomatoes added some onions and cilantro and thats it chips were stale  waited forever for the server she asked us how everything was and when we were explaining the food problems she just looked at us and said oh ok and walked away  we shared our table with a fly which got worse because the table was not cleaned up so the dishes with food just sat there and the fly brought friends  then my niece took her daughter to the bathroom and was met by roaches running around the bathroom  so finally we asked for the check which took our waitress 22 mins to get to us  i complained to the manager which told us that they were having sewer problems and they were working on it  should have read reviews because someone complained about a flooded bathroom back in jan  well the sewer problem still exist  so if you are looking to enjoy authentic homemade mexican like they advertise  go somewhere else like another reviewer stated as they looked around how can people eat this stuffawful my advice is do not order from here asked for well done pizza and received half cooked dough and runny toppings pizza was cold in the middle and bread sticks not even room temperature i would suggest papa johns a mile down the road and avoid this joint at all costsorder was wrong order taker was rude i was exited to see a taco place in town but was very let down terrible service and they didnt even care the food was just so so train your wait staff so they know the menuif i could rate them 0 i would  this is my first rating on yelp i never bother but this place is so bad i have to warn people i work in the office across the street we affectionately call this place no lit coffee because it is so bad   why you may ask well for starters they have the rudest workers ever someone wrote in a previous review i felt like i was imposing even coming in there they nailed it really bad attitudes they are constantly out of everything i once went and proceeded to ask for four different sandwiches each time they told me they were out of all four as i went down the list i had to laugh because they were literally out of almost everything on the menu thats the general issue i was told maybe if id come earlier for lunch they would have had more yea right around 11 she said it was 1115am sometimes the coffee is okay sometimes not but dont expect good service or a straw for your iced coffee because they just dont have either    ive been there over 10 times simply because i didnt know there was anything else in my work area do yourself a favor and go across the street into m market where you will get good service with a smile sunlight better wifi better food and great coffee this place will not stay open long because they literally have the worst customer service in all of nashvillestill terrible i had a late breakfast here and did not even have to wait i still disliked my food and thought the prices were outrageous home fries are still delicious pancakes are still garbage 3 plastic sausages are garbage service is still garbage   about the service i ordered grits with cheese with my pancakes sausage and home fries do not order the grits with cheese the cheese is a piece of kraft american cheese cut up with a knife and put in a lump below your grits the grits arent even hot enough to melt the cheese fully and it is disgusting the grits themselves are ok but the cheese absolutely sucks and it costs extra  anyhow i got my grits and my waitress said check to see if theres cheese in there so i put my fork in there and mixed around the grits i did not see cheese she said oh sorry i mixed this one up so she picks up my grits walks over three tables and serves them the grits that i had just played with she then picked up a bowl of grits from their table and gave it to me not exactly like sneezing into something and serving it to me but damn close   just go to ihop its the same thing but so much cheapersuper rude customer service the man working the front was very abrasive and short with us we were interested in doing tastings at both the brewery and the distillery and decided against coming here after our servicei will never eat nor order takeout from this establishment again this restaurant is walking distance from my office so after having ordered takeout several times before some colleagues and i decided to walk over and dine in since the weather was so nice big mistake we barely sat down before being asked for our orders when told we needed more time the waiter rolled his eyes at us and walked away he proceeded to be curt with is throughout the duration of our meals never once were we offered refills on drinks our plates were not cleared upon finishing and one of my colleagues had to ask for a takeout container 3 times to top it off the cashier was taking phone orders seating guests and ringing up the checks at the same time i get that it was during the lunch rush but there is no excuse for rude behavior when i am spending money in your establishment hire more help i will not spend another dime herethis place is an fing joke  the food tastes good but the small portions are ridiculous  you could spend 100 per person just to feel like you ate an entire meal  i like tapas and i like the idea of tasting plates but this restaurant needs to rethink itself  its in east falls not rittenhouse square and the ambiance is not good enough to justify the the prices  its a great restaurant if you want to waste your money and feel like a chumpordered a family diner which is supposed to include a whole chicken beans and rice  on more than one occasion i got home and opened the box to find one breast and a mix of thighs legs and what appeared to be a back  the chicken is often over salted and over cooked  the yellow rice is the worst i have ever had  how in the world can you mess up rice  the beans often are mostly liquid and the beans are missing  the last time it happened i called  800 number corporate headquarters on the receipt and was advised that someone from the brandon restaurant would call me  ronnie not sure since i couldnt understand his message called and advised me to come back to the drive through and my entire meal would be replaced  i went today and gave them my name but was advised they could not replace the meal  ok i guess you can lose a customer forever over a 1200 chicken meal and that is fine by me  no great loss for meif i could give them zero stars i would this is indeed airport food so my expectations were low however for 13 i expect edible i first perused the premade salads in the fridge which were mostly expired so be sure to double check i settled on a hummusveggie panini the vegetables were not presliced so she took 5 minutes prepping cucumbers once the sandwich was in hand and i took my first bite i immediately knew the salad mix was past its expiration making my whole sandwich slimy and sourtasting do not stop at this place  keep walking or better yet plan ahead like i shouldve donei waited half an hour in a drive thru that traps you in when i finally got to the window i got no apology and a bag of cold tacosi ordered your food a certain way when it got delivered it was as if they ignored everything i asked for when i called back to talk to a manager they asked me to call back after 2 oclock well thats long after my lunch is over and so i have to sit here and wait for a new sandwich for over two hours horrible rude and they really shouldnt have four stars because service is one of the most important partsthis location is terrible and its been that way for a while im always rushed going through the drive through and i always have to check my bag because this location always forgets something i ordered every time i go there seriously like every time ive also had times where my soda had no syrup in it because they forgot to change it and they didnt change the syrup so i could get another one ive also had instances where ive seen cockroaches on the floor inside overall one of the worst bks ive ever been to i only go because of the convenienceok so dqs food is pretty on point for fast food but there service just straight up stinks  i order chicken fingers and they asked if i would like to make it a combo i advised no since i only drink water  i asked for a water cup and they gave me a 4 oz cup maybe 6 oz literally it was the size of the swish and spit cups at a dentist office i thought it was a joke but it was not  i was required to get a the cup for an extra buck rather than having to go back to the drink station four or five times  i wonder if dairy queen thinks the potential loss of 20 cents in merchandise cup and if i was trying to put the screws to them and get a soda is worth a customer leaving with a negative feeling  i will go back to dq but i will avoid this one for sureive been coming to this store for months without a problem today was the last time i stepped into this location i thought walmart was the worst this just might top the worst customer service in my life today the cashier asked for my id to pay with a target gift card then she asks me if i want to apply for a credit card i replied did you not hear im paying with a target gift card not by credit she called a manager who was as stubborn as her told her she can stock all the items back i dont need an attitude because youre not getting a bonus for signing me up what kind of dumb shit is this avoid this store shop onlinecame in today and set a wait list reservation and they said it would be about 1015 minutes an hour later still no text back and brunch plans ruinedended taking my girl to chipotle  disappointing experiencewe decided to try something new since we had just moved more central from northeast i did peep yelp to check out some reviews and figured it was worth a shot the food was so bland i ordered the spinach artichoke dip or whatever it washorrible also we had two kinds of pizza both sucked we are big foodies and we didnt even finish half maybe i would consider giving this place a second chance but honestly it isnt worth the moneynot worth all the hype  small portions  pasta dishes with no meat  small menu choices  very noisy very small place  the only thing worth getting were the cinnamon sugar zeppoli dessert  wouldnt go back  try il fiore down the street  u wont be disappointed  fab food  nice portions with a fast food restaurant you are getting the traditional food served at every other fast food restaurant so reviews on yelp are not meant necessarily to review the food but the service   every time i have ever been here the wait has been atrocious it is called fast food and yet i find myself waiting a long time on more than one occasion i have left due to the speed also that being said if i am going to wait i would prefer the food to be freshly made otherwise why did i wait however this last time the food was cold which is truly unfortunate the reason i did not complain in person is twofold one i was so hungry i couldnt fathom waiting for them to accurately make my food two i actually fear restaurant confrontations as i am terrified the people will mess with my food maybe it is silly to be afraid of that but i know it happensim a big fan of st louis bread co but the experience i had this morning was horrible i stopped by the drive thru since l was on a tight schedule with one person in front of me it still took ten minutes to reach the window i then was told the computer was down and being rebooted five minutes or so later still nothing eventually another worker opens the window and says shes reringing the order but not charging me for the frozen mocha i never ordered a frozen mocha she finally found our sandwich which i paid full price for it was cold hard burnt and made incorrectly i didnt have time to complain since i was late and there were about 7 cars behind me by then ill never be going back to this locationthe staff here is so rude  lady had asked me what you want she wasnt even looking at me so i assumed so wasnt talking to me then she looked at me and said it again there was no thank you not even a smile or nothing the entire time i was ordering shundra didnt look up at me one time the only thing she kept saying was yup yupyup  with an attitude like that you shouldnt be working with the public  only giving it 1 star because the food was goodbeen here long ago after eating at glendale location  lots have changed  more like a pub now instead of a diner  stopped for something cool on a 96 degree day  we were stupid to order a milkshake from a diner  first off the temp inside matched the outside  our bartender yes that is the best way to describe her  delivered our shakes  kind of strange looking at someone so old dressed in little shorts and top showing all her tattoos belly piercing etc  the shakes were like nestle quick poured over ice cubes and blended  i know this was not true because im rating from the bathroom at home  beware  might be a hot spot for drinking but not a place for kids or shakes just sayingterrible pizza and worse customer service was totally unhappy with every facet of your businessthis is the dirtiest saint louis bread  panera ive visited all the tables we attempted to sit on were dirty they got the order wrong which is becoming too common at several paneras in the past couple of yearsthere are a handful of good people here it is a shame the rest of them are very rude and unprofessional you wait forever on your meds and then sometimes then give you somebody else s stuffpoor quality of food even if the prices are low and small portions i would not go back sorryclaimed a star reward by ordering a java chip frappuccino at the drive thru here i was very disappointed with the watered down taste  mostly ice and only a few chipsbe aware this is a cash only store  we always shop by using a credit card which affords us a level of fraud protection  this store does not take credit cards at all  keeping this in mind i do not feel comfortable going here with a pocket full of cash  winco needs to join the current century and honor major credit cardsi have passed this bakery thousands of times tonight i had a craving for baked goods it was too hot to make my own so i figured id give it a try i was very disappointed i purchased chocolate chip cookies and a nutella cupcake i could tell that they were well made and both had good favors however both had an overriding taste ofi cant place it its like when you store something in a container and your food starts to taste like the container not a pleasant taste and pretty much a waste of moneyevery so often maybe once every two months im faced with the dilemma of the fast food half hour lunch break  since i neglected to prepare a lunch from home i have the option of going hungry or getting into my car and risking the loss of my parking spot in order to venture away from work to obtain some approximation ofnutrition from one of the fast food places in the area  usually theres no time to do anything but drive to the place shovel food into my mouth and scramble back to work with the desperate hope that i wont get awful indigestion from whatever ive managed to consume  delicious  this is a combination kfc  taco bell  they could probably throw in a pizza hut if they were wanting to complete the unholy trinity and open up a yum brands hellmouth underneath the restaurant  they have a drive thru thats extremely small and stupid jerks will try to pull into it and block traffic on meridian street sometimes  theres a good chance that somebody will walk up to your car and ask for money while you wait in the drive thru line which moves extremely slowly  you usually get about ten minutes from the time you place your order to the time you receive it which gives you ample time to really really consider the mistake youre about to make  that is unless youre on a half hour lunch break  in that case youre already ten minutes into your downward spiral of a meal which can only end in tears and heartburn  this taco bell is a pretty good place to go if you want the crushing existential terror of the world around you manifested into a burrito or a chalupa  if i were to pull up and check in on yelp my tip would just say good luck or abandon hope all ye who enter here or perhaps youre making a mistake  oh god leave before its too laeggs in salad were so old they were petrified  salmon was cooked to leather  decor is meh bathroom was dirty  got a bowl of the worst bowl of clam chowder ive ever had well paid for a bowl but got a cups worthive always been curious about this place because ive seen photos of their dessert cases  i went with my mother in law and my 7 month old daughter for a late lunch  when we pulled up we werent even sure that it was open as it looked quite desolate but that could have had to do with the time of day  as we approached the building i saw a broken beer bottle near the door and the cigarette catcher looked as if it had been on fire at some point  when we walked inside it felt as if they didnt have air conditioning  it wasnt unbearable but it definitely wasnt ideal  the service is what you expect from a diner type restaurant  the salad bar intrigued me as im a sucker for a salad bar but due to the temperature in the building i thought it would be a good idea to steer clear of that  i ordered a breakfast skillet meal as the menu stated that they served breakfast all day  the potatoes were definitely reheated and hard as rocks  i had to ask for ketchup and hot sauce to make the dish edible  the high chair that they brought for my daughter was literally falling apart and i eventually just held her in my lap as i ate since i didnt want to risk it falling apart under her wiggly body  when i went home i told my husband that we will not be visiting there again because it was just a depressing experience all around  i agree with a previous reviewer they need a total overhaul this place was probably once good but it seems that its fallen by the wayside with other dining options in the areagot spring rolls and their shrimp fried rice since we were skeptical of getting pho at a place where the people did not know how to speak vietnamese spring rolls were alright definitely not the best ive ever had but they were decent although a little plain tasting if you didnt douse it with sauce whatever the thing that was really bad was the fried rice first of all it was all orange and tasted like i dont know did they use ketchup or some tomato sauce to make it the rice itself wasnt even good the shrimp were orange too and gross it was super greasy too not appetizing at all it was shared between three girls and we didnt even make a dent in it van d lost her appetite and didnt even want to try it have we been too spoiled by the vietnamese food we have available in the san gabriel valley and westminstergarden grove area i dont know either way it didnt taste goodi really dont like il posto i rate this on the basis of several breakfasts   i find their breakfast menu uninspired and lazy and their service matches their menu my final straw was this morning when i arrived with a group of eight as the restaurant opened there was one person behind the bar and he was clearly not interested in being there or providing even adequate customer service he looked hungover as he reached into the cookie jar to grab one for himself i asked for a hard boiled egg in addition to my bagel he looked at the basket do they leave their eggs out overnight and said they were out i suppose as part of their lazy personna they cannot exert the energy to actually boil more eggs in the morning for breakfast he was very slow to take the groups orders at the counter he then slowly prepared the food again were talking uninspired foodbagels and yogurt but did not bother to tell us when he was done so we waited and waited we were at a large table around the corner and were trying to be patient the food when we noticed it was ready was fine then someone at the table did not get served yogurt and granola that he had  ordered he and i went up and the employee said that he had written down three orders of the yogurt and had made three he continued to insist on this point and felt no responsibility to make the situation right despite the fact that his customer had paid for it  i have never wanted to reach into a tip jar and remove my tip after a meal but i really wanted to this timelived in chicago for 2 years i miss dunkin donuts being on every corner this one is a pathetic excuse for a dd slow service i was literally just told they do not sell long johns yes you do dont lie to customers just because you are out of everything all of the time how can a dunkin donuts in chicago that is basically run out of a closet be so much better than a full store with a full staff   went back again i dont know why i punish myself the donuts are awful and the service sucks  they need to close this location or get some new managementawful  getting worse  we live nearby so weve wanted very badly to like this restaurant  if you enjoy greasy food that all tastes similar dash right overotherwise find somewhere else to eat  when this restaurant first opened the food was decent and drinks were great  really fun vibe  the vibe has remained though food quality has slid  during our last fifth visit the margaritas were rushed overpowered by individual ingredients  so much so that we had to request side ingredients and mix our own at the table  keep your expectations low if you venture oververy disappointing we went to dinner early with our children to avoid the crowd and we wont be going back first they were out of kids menus sprite  straws did i mention the server was sloppy and not professional when the food came out the chicken was raw in the middle on two of the four entrees ordered the soup was ok and the cheese sticks were good but the marinara was horrible and tasted bitter i would hate to see how things are at a later dinner when they are busybeautiful space during the day but expect to hear every drunk clown with the open air layout  hotel staff will make zero effort to remind people that some guests do actually sleep before 3 amthis casino was a joke so let me get this right 900 for two night stay during the middle of the week 900 for a basic roomthe high prices were definitely attract people to spend money at the casino what a jokei am a huge fan of the south philly location but to say that this one is a disappointment is an understatement ive had the pork sandwich with rabe and it was barely decent the cheesesteak i had was in all honesty the worst i have ever had steak ums taste better and that is horrific i thought mine was just bad but then i tasted my wifes and we wont be at this location again i wont even get into how long it takes to make a cheesesteakvery crowded food is a definite downgrade compared to the rock hill location pizza was just rubbery and it is supposed to be a staple there definitely overhyped would rather go to marcella nearbyone of the slowest taco bells weve been to was not a one time thing either nobody seems in a hurry even though theyll be lots of people waiting also closed lobby about twenty minutes early last saturday today we walked outterrible went to drive thru gave me a cheese burger instead of hamburger told me to keep it cant take it back gave me new burger this time it was a single instead of double third try they finally got it right double just ketchup 3 burgers for price of one good place to take a family im sure you will get some free food out of itbreakfast of powdered eggs bacon melted through the styrofoam no bread totally unsatisfyingi love going to chatham tap on mass ave and have always had good experiences there so i figured this one would be the same but that wasnt the case   my friends and i went there on friday night to socialize and have a few drinks we sat outside and ordered a round of beers our waitresss name was jen she looked 16 but said she had recently turned 21 she had just graduated from some school in chicago with a degree in mental health and landed a job on the south side of indy doing that but she was waitressing as a second job when it came to being a waitress she was still wet behind the ears very green she brought us out our beers for a place that prides itself on sun king which is delicious she brought the wrong one she didnt seem to knowledgeable about it drank it anyways then we started to smoke and she came out and told us we couldnt smoke on the patio unless there was nobody else out there we ordered another round we were drinking them slow talking and enjoying the night we decide to smoke so this time we got up and went out in front of the bar where its acceptable to smoke came back to the patio and there were 2 groups of people smoking at tables nobody including her said anything to them thats bullshit talked awhile longer sipping our beers finished them and decided to order another at this point she asked if we were driving and we said yes she cut us all off and brought out waterum what she said she couldnt serve us anymore   we had drank 2 beers each over the course of an hour and 45 minutes which was all any of us had drank that day we werent slamming beers or anything ive never been cutoff anywhere let alone after 2 beers thats just unacceptable and for no reason uncalled for the service here is awful   we left and went to britton tavern which is where we should have gone in the first place we finished off the night there no problems   i had high expectations for this location based on the one on mass ave but it was a let down  my recommendation is go to britton tavern or nickel plate and skip this onei would love to give no star at all i ordered food but it didint come all ofcourse so i called them and they just give me 10  yeah like i would order ever again from here so i get a spit in my food so i lost 6 with this pizza hut all i know i wont order from them ever again its the 3th time they do i dont care about those 6 but customer service sucksif i could do no star at all i would first time my husband and i went here didnt know where to go stood at the door confused for 30secs until we saw the host behind the pole was direct upstairs when we got upstairs nobody told us where to go sit or greeted us again we asked a waitress where our table was at she pointed to it and had a snobby attitude came by 1min later with the menu took a little long for our food to come out when other customers who came after got their food already when we finally got our food the waitress just threw the plates in front of us came to check up on us once didnt offer is water like she offered other customers do not go here first and last time i will step foot in this restaurant red lobster was better and worth my money with better servicei took my son here for a sundae tonight  he has celiac disease so i asked the waitress to find out if the peanut butter sauce or marshmallow sauce had gluten in it the server quickly said we dont do gluten freebasically refused to serve my son ice cream because he has an allergy  since this is an ice cream restaurant and we have never had an issue with ice cream i asked her to send her manager over  the manager came over and said she would go get the allergen list  sure enough the sundae my son wanted was gluten free  the manager offered no explanation for what the waitress did or really refused to do nor did either of them apologize  naturally the sundaes were subparmine was even made with wrong ingredientswhich could be very dangerous for someone with allergies the sundaes also looked as if they were made by a child who dumped all the sauces on top or the very rude waitress and manager retaliated because i fought back against her refusal to serve a child with an allergy  either way incompetence or retaliation this is not a place to take your kids for ice cream who have allergies in 3 years of dealing with celiac disease this was the worst experience we have hadwent there with my husband and a friend we waited 15 minutes for our drinks after we finally got them we ordered our food it took them over an hour to serve us the waitress never bothered to check in on us the whole time we where waiting we got our food and my chicken salad had a long black hair in it i had to wait 10 more minutes to flag down our waitress  told her about the hair and showed her  her responds was ok she took the salad and returned with a new one  not once did she say sorry or let me tell her that i did want any salad at all ended up paying for a salad that i never ate we will not be returningi was brought here by my boyfriend for my birthday  needless to say we were both disappointed  the ambiance is more geared toward gordon fisherman rather than a couple on a date  the drinks tasted watered down like there was no liquor involved at all  the famous fries  were excessively seasoned damn near giving me high blood pressure  and once the entrees came out oh my gosh it smelled horrid  the first and last time i will ever step foot in hereit took 45 minutes to get through the drive thru and get my food  one person was working  only  he even told me he was the only one there  it was rush hour  how do you not have more people working  i wont try this wendys ever againa friend told me i had to go to this place  i will not go back  a middleageolder woman behind the counter was pretty unpleasant and demanding despite that they werent busy  there were maybe 2 or 3 customers besides myself  she was unfriendly and patronizing during every ounce of my shortlived conversation with her  for example she seemed to think i was an imbecile for asking if they had plain cheese croissants rather than ham and cheese  also i asked for an iced coffee and she said they dont have iced coffee because we dont compete with starbucks and pjs  we just dont do that so we only have regular coffee  youll have to go somewhere else for that sort of thing  i happily and politely said no problem ill take a large hot coffee  she didnt acknowledge what i had said or respond at all to me and was instead helping another customer at the register  another girl behind the counter saw me standing there waiting and asked what i needed  i told her i think i had ordered a coffee with the other woman but wasnt sure  the older woman at this point sternly told me that she was taking care of my order despite that she wasnt in the least    customer service is important to me so id recommend going to pjs or starbucks which flank the patisserie on either sidethis review is based solely on the customer service i received on august 17 2014  its been a while but i still remember the horrible experience with the manager  ive been to this store many times and decided to take my visiting friend to buy some pralines as gifts to give away    i asked a staff member this middle aged white lady who was apparently the manager as i later found out to try a sample of the sweet potato praline and she gave me attitude and responded some people need to learn how to say please  i was annoyed with her but easily brushed it off  after i made my purchase she rudely commented on how some people just dont understand when i found her lame joke confusing  then she just had to stick in how between my friend and i it was clear who could understand things and who had manners    i found her extremely unpleasant and rude and was thinking what kind of customer service is this   just because i didnt use the word please doesnt mean that i was rude to her  i felt that due to my age and race she was very discriminatory as im sure she wouldnt have attacked a middleaged white customer if they asked the way i asked which again was pretty standard    i told her that i thought she was being rude and that i wanted to speak to the manager  ironically she was the manager  i stated that i would leave a negative review on yelp as well as contact the owner to complain about her poor service and unpleasant attitude  she told me that i should go ahead and do that and to not come back  this has been one of the worst customer service experiences ive ever had to deal with  its been around 2 months and i still havent forgotten about this horrible experience so here is the review i promised to leave for that horrible manager and keep in mind that she actually suggested that i write this  in summary never going back to this store againwent there to redeem a coupon special after 5pm 10 for 10 krystal and 10 wings they redeemed it but took 45 minutes to make my orders the people and cars that came after me got their orders before me no biggy i forgive them   came in the next day and ask for the same order and they replied oh we are not redeeming that coupon will you just redeemed it yesterday and their is not expiration dates on these coupons bunch of lazy no good chumps false advertisement is what it istime management and customer service is horrible we were told our order would be ready within 2025 minutes my boyfriend went in to pick up the order 20 minutes after we called and we waited an additional hour and 20 minutes longer i ended up following after him after he told me he was getting upset and exchanged words with someone who worked there when i entered i asked him if anyone apologized for the wait if anyone offered a discount due to the inconvenience they asked him for the money as soon as he walked in to get the foodwe wouldve left if that wasnt the case or if they offered anything else with our order  he said no which made me upset there were other people waiting for food for an hour as well someone came in who worked for the company and heard me speaking about the issue with my boyfriend still no apology we got our food which was cold and the rice was white to be considered as fried chicken was thrown on top as well my mom said it was bland our pasta was dry little to no sauce an apology wouldve been a start to fix this issue but one wasnt given this was his first time eating from tasties  he said he never wants to eat from there again its really the small things that keep customers coming back unfortunately nobody working at tasties did any of those things today and lost customers they claim to be open until 1100 on fridays came tonight at 1025 and the door was locked hostess shrugged and mouthed they were closed this early on a friday horrible business practice ive been coming here at least twice a month after dinner in the city so annoyed by this occurrence i will not be backthis place is trash pizza was over an hour to deliver and it was cold when it got herei generally am very easy to please when it comes to eating out food a little off no problem could have used a little more water refills ok it happens   but bareburger took everything not to the next level but a whole new definition of bad  we arrived to a hip atmosphere trendy staff and what appeared to be great food   the food was good that is after waiting about an hour for two burgers to come out the fries were hot unfortunately the burgers werent we didnt dare ask for them to be warmed up in fear of never seeing food for the rest of the night the most amazing part of the whole thing was the complete lack of urgency on behalf of the staff no hustle no urgency no acknowledgement of the ridiculousness of the situation   sorry guys you make a decent burger but we wont be backmy wife and i were extremely disappointed with the tace lounge valentines dinner  the normal menu was unavailable and was substituted with a special valentines menu  the meals were priced ranging from 45 to 60 dollars per person  way overpriced for the quantity and quality we were served   i left before the entertainment started  waitress was new and inexperienced but tried very hard  good luck we will not be going backseriously i am a regular at this place going there once a week at least  today i ordered two aca bowls to go which i was very disappointed about i feel like ever since they started to grow they started to become greedy they used to put chia seeds in the indulge  bowl which now they dont  charge 2 for it  in addition to this today i got home with two bowls that were supposed to have granola a normal decent amount but of course not instead there was literally like maybe half of a teaspoon of granola in the bowls seriously karma how is this even called a bowl when you barely get a taste of granola theyre so money hungry i guess this is unacceptable i will not recommend this placejesse h  2010 probably would be the year i visited several times and never returned my team was sponsored by village pub and when we brought a trophy in to celebrate we got half assed thanks i mean we appreciated the tiny shirts you donated we returned them all because they were made for hooters girls and the replacements were xxl but i digress maybe my experience roots back to first opening but your comment asking if ive really been or just saw pictures help reiterate why i wont be back also i cant or couldnt in 2010 apparently park a pathfinder safely in that loti love shrimp and grits but my entree completely missed the mark the shrimp on top of the grits were the tiniest shrimp ive ever seen  they looked exactly like the bagged frozen grocery store shrimp used in salads they were not fresh gulf shrimp nor were they as pictured here we counted 27 of them they were boiled not grilled panfried or sauteed the tasso gravy was tasty but there was so much of it that it completely overwhelmed the grits very disappointingfire the entire management and employee staff covering lunch and start over its a mess inside and drivethru constantly long waiting times at both as employees go at whatever pace they feel like take your business to wendys in ks instead they seem to have management better organized to lead a team through high peak traffic timeswaited 20 minutes to be seated it did not happen waiter  hostess told us it just be a few minutes twice but did nothing to prepare a clean table or ask us if we would like to sit at the counter so we left cant say how the food is and wont be finding out soon or going back i am surefood was cold and the taco was more lettuce than anything will not be back at this locationwe were there this past weekend and we got in after a 20 minute wait we were seated which was pretty good on a saturday night as soon as we were seated the server came over took our drink and appetizer order we were immediately given our drinks yummy bread and our appetizer service was great up to this point only then it was downhill our dinner was taking a long time to be brought out and we never saw our server she never came by to check on us give us an update or anything we just sat there  the food was bad i ordered the prime rib special which came with mashed potatoes salmon and a small lobster tail so i thought when it finally came out i couldnt even tell it was prime rib it was so blackend that for me it was too spicy to eat i couldnt taste anything but pepper i did notice the prime rib was not juciy but dry and tough i was wondering about the salmon well come to find out it was salmon mashed potatoes which was gross it was so fishy it wasnt even dressed up with butter or anything the only good food item was my lobster tail my partner had the lamb which was tough and not juicy and was just ok nothing special  without alcohol our food bill was over 100 i feel so jipped for paying that much for what we had it was one of the worst meals i have ever had  yes i did send my prime rib back and guess what now they were all out so i had the last piece that was just sitting for who knows how long in the pan so it makes since on why they tried to cover that fact up with seasoninglolthey brought me out a filet mignon piece and it was much better but still no bang for my buck i cant believe for a restuarant like this when the food was sent back no manager came out i got better service at the outback at homevery rude and attitude and cashier does not feel like taking your order and ordered the wrong thing and does not feel like giving you a refund without having an attitude and refusing to do an xray for something else that you do not wanti tried to order the mediterranean chicken dinner which is listed on the menu the employee behind the counter told me they no longer served that there only salmon and steak i asked if she meant they were out of chicken for the day no she said they just dont serve it any longer i left and went to the vets location insteadyour new packaging sucks  trying to stir a grabbagreen now makes a huge mess  go back to the box  its cute and functional  irritatingawful awful awful im never going back that place is filthy the food was disguising the all you can eat sushi buffet bar for 995 at lunch is not worth itthis place was a joke  we were sat at a table the was not even clean  the table cloth was dirty and full of crumbs  we ordered bruchetta which had very little on it and the cheese wasnt even melted  the food was nothing to brag about  i have had better frozen italian with sauce from a jar  the owner is very arrogant and does not care if his customers are happyawful have been there for breakfast a few times was always good however tried it for lunch frankly ive had better hospital food dry tasteless overpriced crappy servicefood was bland potato salad creamed spinach  cole slaw had no flavor ribs were tough and underdone veggie burgers were seasoned well but possibly not even cooked or barely heated up at the least hush puppies  fries were good kids macncheese was ok wait staff was very friendly and did a great job  expensive considering the poor qualityi wanted to like this truck as i enjoyed it at a previous food truck event  unfortunately this time around they took my order and i waited at least 20 minutes while other orders behind me were getting done  they were very disorganized to say the least    i ordered the jerk chicken  when i opened the package what a disappointment  one piece of thigh meat with six pieces of soggy chicken skin sitting in the sauce  wowso not worth the wait or the 10 price  they get one star for my friends fried fish dish which was okay  i genuinely hope they can turn it around and get consistencyi dnt knw if theres a new cook but the ox tails had no flavor at all nothing like it use to b very upset the whole thing went in the trashvery disappointed clearly not an authentic mexican restaurant the flavor of the mexican rice and the refried beans was not that good to begin with but on top of that they tasted like they were old as if the food had been sitting there in a warmer all day the rice tasted like it was scraped from the bottom of the pan it was dry and crunchy i rarely dont finish a meal but i left food uneaten service was well there wasnt any nobody even came back to check how the meal was or refill drinks or bring more chips anytime i needed anything i had to get up and go find someone and even then they didnt send anyone to the table the people that were supposed to be at the order counter werent where they were supposed to be they were standing outside the restaurant its no wonder you have to pay for your meal up front and it was about three times the price as it usually costs us to eat mex food would not go back to this placestrange that anyone would want to try this joint including myself going back would be just stupid really the worst doughnuts ive ever had  doughy dry and tasteless i think they were at least a day old and i bought them in the morning did i mention overpricedworst service ever and i mean ever   after someone took my food by accident i asked them to make another one for me and i waited another 5 minutes they misunderstood and didnt add chicken to the pizza i ordered so the employee rolled his eyes at me and gave me this look  so after 15 minutes of waitingi got my food  i have never been treated this way at any fast food place even no one apologized   now i go out of my way not to go to cosi they dont care about their customers they just make the money but heystudents need foodso they go to cosi  is it too much to ask for employees to be respectfuli had eaten once at blakes in new mexico and it was pretty good so i was excited when the tucson location opened severely disappointed i was there on a recent saturday in the drive though and waited not only for at least 10 minutes for the one car ahead of me to receive what looked like just a sauce packet but personally for my own food for about 10 minutes no one even came to the window until they collected my money and handed me the subpar chile cheeseburger combo the burger was drenched in mustard and the patty tasted fresh off the hockey rink it was semi cold and soggy rendering anything possibly positive the cheese and the chilis just a mess the fries were ok nothing special and nothing about this experience would ever make me want to come back i should have left while waiting forever in the drivethrough as i contemplated multiple timesi am done with this place while the coffee is excellent the baristas are total aholes yesterday i was next in line and the barista bypassed me and placed the order for the guy behind me that appeared to be a regular really i was in shock there was no apology nor was there any eye contact when he finally took my order the baristas were more interested in chatting with the regular folks than finishing up with my order this is not the first time this has happened and i am not returning total morons running this place i dont care how good your coffee is if you dont know how to treat customers there is no need for me to give you my businesspulled up at drive thru at 457 am and waited till 5 and was greeted by employeewho stated that they open at 5am when i explained that it was 5am she advised me that she goes by the store clock and they would be ready in 10 minutes really wake up corporate this is not acceptablegiving bad review because we were so excited to come here planned to come at 5 on saturday and when we arrived they said that they close at 5 change your website hours dude we left with very very sad faces and unsatisfied tummysi hate to be this guy but im pissed im almost 30 years old and ive never written a negative review on a restaurant tonight i was running errands after work and hadnt had a chance to eat since breakfast i attempted to call to place a pickup order several times but got a busy signal after the 5th time it finally rang once and was answered please hold silence now its a friday night so i assume they are busy no big deal right while on hold i went into petco got dog food then got gas and realized i was still on hold 15 minutes so i hang up and try to call back busy signal so i say screw it and drive there i walk up to the bar and they arent busy at all 3 4tops and a 3 top with 3 servers a runner and a bartender so i see the phone sitting on the bar and call while standing there busy signal the server thuy asks me if she can help me now i know from being in the industry that being an asshole isnt going to get me anywhere but they should be aware of the issue because they are losing business so i explain to her what i just told you and continue to tell her that this is the third time in two weeks that it has happened her response was okay well i dont know where the phone is do you want me to take your order as if she could care less that the phone may be off the hook i bit my lip and ordered a few minutes later i see the bartender grab the phone without looking press the end button and set it back down after he put me on hold he purposely took the phone off the hook i began to boil but kept my mouth shut this place is a block away and the food is decent so my fianc and i go almost every week but not after tonight instead we will go to bahn mi i hope the owner sees this so they get their ish togetheraka crappys pizza  my partner ordered a pizza by phone for pickup when we arrived to pickup our pizza the staff was unenthused and less than stellar at giving good customer service i went to the counter and the guy asked me what was my order i said the name our pizza was under apparently they dont use names on the order remember my partner ordered so i didnt know they hadnt asked for one he asked what kind of pizza it was and i told him i didnt know that i was not the one who ordered it he said how could you not know what kind of pizza you ordered with a condescending tone i called my partner over and then at that time another man yelled from the kitchen was it a and he listed the ingredients on our pizza my partner confirmed that it was and then we went to pay they dont tell you over the phone that this is a cash only restaurant so when i handed him my card he said can you read the sign its cash only we have an atm   2014 and we dont accept credit cards   after getting our pizza we arrived back in the car and began to drive about a block when my partner who was holing the box began to feel his leg getting hot the over saturated pizza had so much sauce it was coming out of the box onto his lap and burning his skin   once we cleaned the outside and inside of my car from pizza sauce pouring out of the corners of the pizza box my partner changed his clothes from being covered in pizza sauce we tried to sit down and enjoy it however the dough was just thatdough there wasnt crust because it was that undercooked the sauce was horrible and saturated the dough   so if you like crappy pizza with crappy servicecappys is your placenot sure why they have to have carcasses hanging in the back behind glass that is really in poor taste vegan or not who wants needs to see thatthis place has deteriorated so quickly  when was initially opened as flying fish crafthouse it was so good creative great menu with amazing staff then unfortunately seemed like for whatever reason the crowd wasnt coming then after the rebranding it all went south mediocre food went from spotless with cool vibe to kinda dirty and not well maintained  so much promise just a shamestaff isnt very friendly inside they look very annoyed every time ive been inside not very inviting to sit and relax and drink or eat usually the drive through seems better to use at this locationi ordered the grilled chicken sandwich meal at a cost of 10 the service was very slow  the tiny piece of chicken was very dry the bun not good  dont order the grilled chickenfirst experience wow the truffle burger and truffle fries rule truffle overload second experience this place is good i enjoy all the options the wait is a little long when busy but thats normal   latest review never coming back the cashier is an unfriendly and very unsympathetic when he never rang up our order and we waited over 20 minutes watching as the 3 people who ordered after us received their burgers no refund no freebies just a simple sorry for the wait and that was it   the place could benefit from better customer service if youre going to screw up the burger is nothing to brag about when you still have shake shack and other restaurants who could build a burger and still treat you like a paying customerive given this establishment three different shots to change my mind each visit yields the same results terrible service accompanied with subpar food and drink every single time tacos are always served very dry and cold like they have been sitting out enchiladas are over cooked and dried to the plate upon serving margaritas are way too sweet with very little alcohol the worst aspect of this place is the service each visit ive waited at least 30 minutes for another beer more chips or an opportunity to order anything if visiting allow for at least an hour and a half if youre going to eat there   too many better options in this city to settle for this placewent to this location before and liked it fine but i went just now and terrible the person who took my order was perfectly nice  the person at the window didnt look at me overcharged me did not give me a receipt and closed the window in my face without speaking to me the store was not busy at the time so i cant imagine she was helping someone else on top of all that my iced coffee was no good three ice cubes floating in warm coffee is not iced coffee i didnt have time to go in and try to fix it or i wouldve asked for a manager ughi really wanted some tacos so i decided to stop by here the cashier that took my order was very nice and accommodating overall my tacos were bery bland  sloppy and lacked flavor although the ingredients sound good on the board the ingredients dont really shine through and all you taste is mush for example i had the pork taco w jalapeo slaw the slaw was chopped very fine  and seemed more  like relish all you taste is watery mayo and nothing resembling jalapeo  shrimp taco just lettuce and red mayo that was supposed to be spicy  mayo no spice at all and my shrimp were very hard as if they were just reheated and not fired fresh  you would be better off getting tacos from taco bell one thing i will say my salted caramel donut was amazing the salted caramel was the right amount of sweetness and the cake donut was moist and not greasy s  i am eating healthier and wasted my cheat day and 11 on this no more cheat daysi was so excited to try this place because they had a great yelp review and it was recommended to me by my cousin you recently traveled here but i had a really awful experience here the service and the food were absolutely terrible i wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy   we were seated and waited about 10 minutes to just get a glass of water  after we were seated and kept waiting we asked the hostess if anyone was going to get us water she looked at me blankly and then walked away then we waited even longer to get water and to order   we ordered the eggs florentine the waiter messed up one of the orders and instead of poached eggs one of the eggs were over easy the whole thing was swimming in some sort of liquid also the hollandaise sauce was cold the hash browns were cold completely unseasoned and not even brown the waiter never checked in on us to see how we were doing   there are lots of lovely brunch places in new orleans but this is certainly not one of themmy wife and i have been to upland many times over the past few years and have always had a good experience it was on our list of go to places in carmel the beer is very good coastbuster is my favorite and the food has always been very good as well we are vegetarian and there have always been some good choices and our very favorite was the southwest tofu salad i say was because when we sat down on the patio last week we were shocked to see the salad was taken off the menu and replaced with another tofu salad that simply is nowhere close to the southwest the tofu tacos are also changed to a new version of bland fried tofu that comes out a bit greasy when we asked our server the reason for the change we were told the chef found the southwest tofu too time consuming to prepare so he took it off never a good idea to remove a top selling and delicious item from your menu out of mere convenience for the kitchen in addition they have taken off the vegetarian pizza option in favor of a meat version ill go back for beers now and then but upland is off my list of go to places for a great meal sorry upland but you should listen to your customers and not your cookswhen i went to pick up my pizza i saw that the girls making the pizza were not wearing any gloves i asked about it and they confirmed that they dont wear gloves to make the food well i went against my better judgement and still ate it after reheating it big mistake after eating my chicago style pizza which was pretty average i ended sick for the rest of the night definitely not going back herebland nothing special abt it a to go joint  if you decide to eat there you will be served a plastic baggie with watery wasabi and plastic cup with nasty tasting soy sauce really wanted to like this place but besides the cool look it was a huge disappointment btw the specialty rolls are ridiculously small for the pricewell we started being seated by creepy chick that stares into your soul when giving you her red robin visit quiz let me stop there and ask what difference does it make if ive been to red robin before let me guess theres menus with food on them perhaps a variety of fountain drinks and a bathroom for people to warm the porcelain after they digest the food   we ordered the chips and french onion dip that tasted awful it tasted like they used a while packet do french onion soup and a teaspoon of sour cream  i ordered a turkey burger that tasted like the soul of my chuck taylors i wore in 4th grade pe class  my boyfriend didnt complain about hid burger but it had avocado and bacon on it you can put those two ingredients on dog poo and it would be good which im sure was the case of his burger  never going again wanted to barf it up when we left so i could reeat something decent  the bottomless steak fries is ridiculous if you need a second helping of fries then you also probably need a cardiologistjust walked in at 840 pm to find they were out of the bread i wanted and one other they were cleaning and had the cutting boards removed so thank you for doing so but just an fyi customers dont really want to see whats under them as the guy put my bread down on the bare metal albeit on paper i saw my bread hanging over and touching the metal counter top right next to a scrapper of some kind with black goo on the end disgusting walked right out itll be a long time before i come back hereabsolutely horrible i ordered grubhub for lunch today i ordered chicken tikka masala and garliccheese naan my order arrived not even 15 minutes later i work about a 15 min walk away this really worried me because they have a menu where you can order your food and they have a lunch buffet as soon as the driver called and said he has arrived i was not too happy because i was worried and assumed that my food was just scooped from the buffet well i opened my food cold cold chicken cold naans pissed being preggo and hungry and wanting a specific craving only to have it arrive cold and totally tasteless is such a let down for 2 dinky naans and a 12oz container of food scooped from a buffet cost me 22 a freakin ripoffwent to dinner at 730 with my girlfriends intending to eat wings and potato fries and get out within an hour our server rose was extremely slow showing barely any attention to us yet could spend minutes talking to tables filled with boys for about 30 min she was just straight up mia when we finally got her attention got our checks and sent them to be rung up we received our checks back with our credit cards at 930 2 hours after we initially sat down one was missing and another one was attached to the incorrect bill my friend had to get up from the table to find her missing card where she eventually found it in a puddle of water on the bar next to some crumbled up napkins they were out of potato fries and every single one of their desserts usually love the outpost but after tonight we are probably never going backwe will not return to this place ordered fried green tomato sliders and mushroom swiss sliders  bread was cold and hard and most of the sandwich was bread  meat was flavorless fried mac n cheese was ok but the onion rings were greasy  bill was 39 for two people crazy for not good food  sorry burger up we wont be going backi have been coming to arners for 30 years and unfortunately it seems to have taken a turn for the worse  first you have to understand this restaurant is was a delaware staple a go to place for good service and foodhaving seen the remodel after fire damage and it just keeping up with the times i have to say i was super disappointed    i took my son for a special sunday morning breakfast  after driving for 45 minutes we arrived just before 10am  the first thing that struck me was the empty parking lot i totally expected to get there and wait for 30 minutes for a table but not this day  we got sat right away i only saw about 710 other tables sat  servers timing was fine and we ordered right away    my son ordered hot chocolate which isnt something he get regularly so this was a big deal that he was allowed to have it and of course he wanted whipped cream  then the hot chocolate arrived it had a clump of white stuff on top which looked like sour cream he took a small bite because it didnt even have enough to cover the top of the hot chocolate so a big bite wasnt possible and i was sure he was going to make an oh my gosh i just ate sour cream face but he made a oh my gosh i just ate weird whipped cream face  i tasted it to be sure and although it wasnt sour it wasnt whipped cream but more like part way whipped cream so i mixed it into the hot chocolate but the unmixed solid cream bits were too much to over come and he didnt touch it again  we ordered creamed chip beef strawberry waffle and an omelet  the omelet was fine cooked well and tasty  however the waffle was covered by the same sorry excuse for whipped cream as the hot chocolate we scrapped it to the side and enjoyed the waffle all the same  the whipped cream looked like an attempt at homemade whipped cream gone wrong or from way too many minutes ago as it was part thick clumps and part runny sauce  the creamed chip beef was more like lumpy sauce with a few pieces of chipped beef very few the taste was ok but it obviously had been sitting around long enough to coagulate making it thick and gloopy if thats a worda little thinning with some milk would have made all the difference  because nothing tasted bad and it was all edible i didnt mention it to the server  but she never asked why it wasnt eaten either which i feel would have been appropriate for her to do  as we sat and waited for the check my son asked what was under the booth across the isle  after looking at the baseboard which he was talking about i explained to him it was just not clean and had lots of splatter on it  so of course now i look around and notice lots of things which were not cleanfood splatter on the booth wallsglass small foodpaper debris all over the floor dirty light fixtures server area was messybasically this place needs to close and deep clean the dinning room things needs to be scrubbed not wiped off scrubbed  if this is what the dining room looks like what on earth does the kitchen look like  on a side note watching servers fix their hair and wipe at their eyesnoses is grossthey need to be told not to do this in the dining room  when i paid the cashier asked me how everything was and i looked at her shook my head and told her it was very disappointingheres the kicker she said nothing after that  she didnt ask me what was wrong what happened why i was disappointed nothing  i responded to her question and told her i was disappointed and she said nothing in response  this is such a shame that an institution a local business has let things go so far wrong that the employees dont even care but a guess if the owners dont care why should theythe worst service ever im pissed at apparent intentional disreguard of my buisness by the drive through person very unprofessiinal  unfriendly i guess its a cultural thing to treat your customers like they are not there  that they are not spending your money with your buisness    i ordered my food paid for it  waited a few minutes later a different woman opened the window ruddly shoved the food in my face closed the window and walked away she did all this without acknowlaging me  looking at me  without ever a single word i took my order  the woman quickly turned closed the window  walked away  no thank you no question  if i may have needed anything else like taco sause  nope just windo open shove food window close walk away i feel like my buisness held no value to these people in this new america a big supreme right  so since i really wanted  needed some taco sauce for my tacos i stayed parked at the window hoping she would return i waited there for the woman to acknowledge me as she could see i was still there and looking to her she seemed to intentionally ignore me  the woman continued with other tasks never giving me a second consideration after about a minute and a half more i put my car in gear drove away and immediately wrote this review hey jimboys in sparks fuck you   from now in its off to del taco and american owned company were they trian their employees to provide reasonable customer service  to respect and value thier customer   i will not be backso very disappointed booked this through open table at 9am  friends came up from chattanooga got a call at 350 saying no reservation not goodworst mcdonalds ever wait times in drive thru are up to 15 sometimes 20 minutes iv been short changed 3 times now by the same older philippine lady that receives payments at first window and then when you call her out on it she just stares at the screen and pretends to be sorry im under the influence that this is her scam also could explain the long wait times my kid doesnt like mustard on his burger and the other one doesnt like lettuce i ask for this every time and have received maybe once correct outta the dozen times iv been i live in the area so i enjoy my coffee before work 15 min for an incorrect coffee order gets old fast i will be traveling to the weber greens mcdonalds from now on i only gave them one star because it wouldnt let me give zeroi have eaten at sylvias three times and i have been disappointed every time i remeber my mom maaking salmon croquettes when i was a kid so i was excited to see them on the menu at sylvias but these were dried clumps of bread filler with a hint of fishy tasting salmon and a side of  some sort of okra slime  the second time i ate there i decided to go in a different direction so i ordered the ribs these were worse than the salmon croquettes  the ribs were huge and plentiful but they were really tough and fatty  and slathered ina a sweet but odd tasting bbq sauce i ate one and brought the rest home to my dog who gave them a five star rating   so the third time i had tilapia it was better than the salmon or the ribs but still very mediocre   why do i keep going back to a place that i dont like well i do some work there occasionally contract work not an employee  and they are nice enough to feed me unfortunately everything i have tried has been pretty bad  i will be working there again soon and i will continue to try different items until i find something decent i cant recommend this place i eat for free and have yet to like anything enough to even finish a meal i would not waste my money at sylviasnot impressed ordered our food and 40 minutes later we received it it was breakfast so very simple eggs and pancakes ice bucket to help yourself was a huge block of ice at least have fresh ice so we are not pounding on it another customer walked in and wanted a pumpkin latte as it was available on their board but it really wasnt because they didnt have the pumpkin yet  overall just not impressedterrible service one of the worst bloody marys i have ever had and one of the saddest blts i have ever seen just over all bad experience will never go backbeware new ownership not same place at all i am so dissapointed in food amd service  really bad for as great as it used to be too many great restaurants to even bother with this place  cold uncooked hashbrowns kitchen yelling at everyone and not good foodwell what else would one expect from a mall starbucks except for mall employees  not starbucks quality employees   aside from watching four other people get their drink before my own they made my first drink correctly however they literally threw my straw at me and my second drink was made wrong vegan and dairy free mean hmmm i dont know maybe no milk is it that hard of a concept   the size of the smoothie that i received after they finally remade the drink was smaller than the first  therefore i over paid for my drink which really pisses me off seeing as i paid 10 for two smoothies   never again i dont recommend anyone getting a drink in the place horriblethere is nothing hot or ready about this place i walked in hoping just maybe there would be a supreme ready to go not even cheese or pepperoni were ready even though it says 48pm everyday and it was friday around 6pm it is the closest to where i live that is the only reason i stop in here rarely and they said it would be 10min wait i went and bought a frozen pizza and made it at home instead this timei find it surprising so many are complaining about their experience with the hostesses  unfortunately my experience began and ended with the hostess  i arrived at 715 and was quoted a 20 minute wait for our party of 2  thats fine  i gave her my phone number and she sent me a text confirming i was on a wait list  i sat in the waiting area by the downstairs bathrooms  a few other larger parties were sat before us but then after waiting 25 minutes 2 other parties of 2 who both arrived after us who didnt have reservations were sat before us  the hostess approaches me assuring a table will be ready in a few more minutes  i ask why were they sat before us and she explains that they only arrived a little bit after us  okay  first come first serve right  maybe both parties tipped her to get bumped ahead  doubt it at this place  so we step outside to get some air and another 20 minutes goes by  at this point its 8pm on a sunday and i left  still never received that text message confirming if my table was ready    i just cant imagine whoever pays the bills around there is happy losing customers to their experiences with a hostess  i dont see myself going backhad the spinach pocket   it was more like eating cardboard   i tossed it in the trash after 2 bites   waste of  639  avoid this placewent at 530 pm they werent open  call before you go this way you wont be disappointed before youre even able to try the productif i could give this place negative 5 stars i would friday night four employees working and they spent most of the time talking to each other and shaking their heads  there was a sign saying bathroom closed for cleaning it took so long to fill orders that i had to go so i ignored the sign and went to the bathroom it wasnt being cleaned and it certainly wasnt clean this was the dirtiest nastiest fast food bathroom i have ever seencomplete with unflushed toilet  i did my business came out and finally my order was filled  they are cheap on sauces for mcnuggets and ketchup for fries  also they all clearly hate their jobs i worked fast food in high school and college and i never had this attitude or observed it in coworkers it makes me wonder how well the ownermanagement treats the employees or doesnt needless to say i wont rush backvery low selection  2 kinds of strawberry frosted 1 chocolatefrosted 1 chocolate glazed literally 2 maple glazed and regular glazed  thats it  1 person working running food to a car in the parking lot then waiting on a person at the drive up window i waited almost 10 minutes the only customer inside  finally gave up waiting and left with no donuts bummer  drove half a mile to the little local competitor they had about 20 choices and waited on me right away1 extra for almond milk   one small almond milk latte 4 nice place and people  and im glad you offer almond milk  but i wont be backi stopped in to get a fish sandwich and ended up with a cut mouth they let the bag clip from the buns fall in my sandwich and i was more than half way thru when i bit into it smh i hate that placepass the 6th stop on our coffee quest was a huge disappointment  pros not busy not expensive friendly smile  cons slow service messed up order very limited pastry selection and no way to heat loud music barking dogs inside there needs to be a sign on the door saying that dogs are welcome so that if you dont want to eat with someone elses dog you can skip it  unimpressed and not recommendedfood is usually late but this time never arrived completely unapologetic over the phone will not be ordering from them againordered a pizza with pep and sausage nothing to crazy  pizza itself was very good  service well i just wish i could go lower then 1 star order was placed for delivery to a business less than 10 minutes away  when ordered was given a time of 45 minutes pretty standard for a friday   after an hour and 15 minutes went by i called to see where the pizza was  i was placed on hold again not uncommon then a guy who i could hardly hear answered and i told him i was checking an order status  i was placed on hold again  when he returned i told him the order and he simply said they left  that was it  no timeframe of when they left what the issue was no apology nothing  i said ok and before finishing my thought he said bye and hung up   15 minutes later the order arrived putting us at 1 hour and 30 minutes double the original timeframe  the pizza was tasty but cold  the driver was friendly but offered no apologies and went on her way   pretty safe to say that it is easier for me to order from palermos pickup only then wait for these guysrude customer service unprofessional service not worthy to waste your time to come hereservice is extremely slow  the server maybe came to our table 3 times and was not at all apologetic the food is awful  my 14 year old daughter could make a better more appealing plate  i felt like the food was overpriced for what we got  my son got a half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich thrown on a plate with no garnish  3 bucks  my daughter had the frittata and it made her sick  i had the spring roll salad and it was bland and the carrots look like they were cut a few days prior to me getting them  my other son had the tomato soup which was more like tomato sauce and he found woody pieces in it  if i was paying mcdonalds prices i would think the food had value  i just expected more from the look of the building and space which is beautiful and clean  we came with friends and the server said we couldnt have separate checks at the end of the 15 hours we were there we had to go to the cashier and hash out who had what the menu is confusing and complicated  if they could simplify the menu they may be able to pull it off with the small kitchen they have  the service would be faster too  i really wanted to like this placeas soon as we walked in the young lady asked us for our order she gave no explanation on the menu items or what the popular choices were when we took longer than one minute to order she prompted the next individual behind us to give us their order because we were clearly indecisive she was rude and unhelpful in explaining what our options were this is not a place to go if wendy is at the counter or any other person who clearly doesnt understand what your company has to offeri like to use uber eats but the draw back is you cant speak with the person that made your sandwich this is unacceptable worst club ever your are a sandwich shop its what you do make a great sandwich especially for take out never againi felt compelled to write a review as i witnessed the most disgusting thing there was a worker there smoking outside she saw me and my kids come in ready to order a sandwich she proceeded to go in the back as i was closely watching her to see if she was going to wash her hands she didnt then proceeded to ask us what we wanted while putting gloves on never washing her hands i quickly walked out with my kids and made a promise to myself never to set foot again in this store if only the owner knew how disgusting her hygiene was theyve lost a customer for good so grossoverpriced and average food   the lobster chowder tastes like flower blended with salt and a little tiny bit of lobster meat they charged 899 for that lobster was good but it doesnt worth of 21 they put way too much mayonnaise on the sandwich fish and chips tastes okay they charge for 18 in overall the food was like 3 star but because of the price i give 1 star  disappointed and waste of moneyget ready to have some stale food with sad faces the food served is of poor quality and seem like it was not freshly cooked the host  was also not welcoming  i wont suggest going to the place worst indian food i ever hadthis was a horrible breakfast and diner area took very long to serve and extremely unpleasant service disgusting women at the register and very rude way too overpriced and definitely not worth to sit and relax either do not go heresad very sad  what happened to charm it was b4 the place is cold noisy and so sterile not a place i want to visit againi hate this store never any help and bathroom is nasty i mean it doesnt get any worse than thisits friday midafternoon in dunedin and i still havent had any lunch  a friend says to me do you like barbeque  after living in the carolinas for much of the last 30 years i respond oh yeah and im pretty hungry too  he goes on to tell me there is an iconic little hole in the wall just a couple of miles away so off we go  its around 230300 so elis has only been open for a few hours  apparently they are only open for two days friday  saturday and you would hope that so early in the schedule they are well stocked with menu items  nope  as we approach the window to place our order i ask the lovely young woman on the other side which do you like better the pork or the beef  she responds enthusiastically the beef  great i say  let me have one beef platter  oooppps  she tells me we are out of slaw  i can let you have a double order of the beans  open for just a few hours and already out of coleslaw  first star lost  moments after placing our order we are called to pick it up  i notice a condiment area with two kinds of sauce  regular and spicy  being a spicy kind of guy i reach for that one  regular kraft bbq sauce is spicierhotter than this stuff  another star falls away  i cant remember when my jaw worked harder chewing slowcooked barbeque beef  doesnt that usually almost melt in your mouth  third star gone  while eating we notice several people wearing elis shirts standing around  they look to be employees  with that many people standing around we started to wonder how they ever managed to run out of coleslaw  before too long two or three of the employees started yammering to each other in a very cartoonish manner from distances of 3035 feet  to be heard from that distance outside you really have to project your voice  these clichs were up to the task another star bites the dust  its possible that i just caught elis in one of those perfect storm moments but with so many other places to enjoy lunch in the area im not sure i will return to find outthe place was clean the staff was very nice my order came out fast which is all very nice but i just dont get it it seems possibly a notch above subway having been out east i have no idea why people love this place so much the sandwiches are not that good really theyre not it is the other side of the coin of how people in a lot of eastern cities think chipotle and other such chains are good mexican food these sandwiches suck sorry also got a lime eegees that was good yumdont go to this wendys ordered food and waited 20 minutes for it to come out it is halloween night but a large crowd of rowdy kids came in and took seats even though only maybe one or two of them were ordering  they also got my order wrong which we noticed before leaving and the cheeseburgers were coldservice it is a completely selfserve restraunt which is borderline confusing when you first walk in you approach the area where the food is being prepared to order but pay after youre done eating  in the back where it looks like the staff takes short breaks  staff theyre present thats about it you barely interact with them or need them honestly  food oh i couldnt wait to tell youll about this its awful your food is ready in barely seconds after you order and this is supposed to be a place that can compare to tazikis another meditteranean cafe thats greatfresh daily and consistently but instead its the complete opposite the meat astes very microwaved along with the rice and unrealistic like mcdonalds meat the basmati rice was not how i normally see it it was over greasy gooey then the supposed tazikis sauce they gave  tastes like runny mayonnaise and their drinks were insanely overpriced their cream sodas were like 295 when theyre a buck cheaper elsewhere overall the only good thing they have  keeping them in business is their location atmosphere but the cuisine is  save yourselfstreet parking only get ready to wait for 25 mins for your order portions are small for the price you pay collard greens are very salty beef short ribs were tough and chewy it was not tender at all all side orders were all gone by 630p only collard greens was leftwe came for a late sunday afternoon lunch after waiting a considerable amount of time for someone to come over we were the only people in the restaurant at the time we were finally greeted by the bartender no one came back to take our order for another long while after finally ordering two small pizzas one glutenfree and one neapolitan crust we then waited over an hour with no pizza in sight the one other table of customers that came in and ordered after us received their pizza and finished eating before ours arrived there was also a hair in one of our water glasses the pizzas finally arrived after about an hour and fifteen minutes no one ever came to check on us otherwise we would have ordered a new water   also when we went to pay our bill we saw a small child running around the kitchen eating cheese out of the cheese bin used for customers pizza i almost threw up my pizza and we ended up throwing away the 35 worth of pizza that we had leftover completely unsanitary unacceptable and waste of money   i realize things like this can happen anywhere with the exception of a toddler in the kitchen the pizzas were slightly better than average but the poor customer service is enough to keep me from coming back there are too many other great options for pizza in stl to waste time at bonosworse customer service i ever had at this ice cream please the server was not polite did not even made mix the right ingredientsi felt like this was a starbucks claim at a trailer park very entertaining staff if you want a show id recommend going in and watching the tattooed toothless baristas trying to figure out how to brew coffee dont order from here they dont know anythinggoing to bbq bbq was one of the most disappointing bbq comfort food experience i have had in the usa the only credit i can honestly give them is that the meats were cooked to the proper temperature  upon entry to this restaurant you are not greeted with the delectable smells of slow cooked food in fact there was no food aroma at all granted i did stop in on a week night but there was no turn over no flow of customers to generate freshly cooked food aromas  the sides came out luke warm the mac and cheese has almost no cheese and the ribs certainly didnt have that loving slow cooked flavor that is the essence of bbq the corn bread and the garlic mashed potatoes clearly came out of a package   dont waste your time this place there is no love in this foodwas stoked for this location to open considering donelson has such limited options in this price range that arent fast food seemed to be hyped up as they trained the staff for weeks before opening   i have worked in foodservice my whole life since i was 17 and have never seen such a unprofessional operation its simply mind boggling to me that places can be out of nearly half of there menu daily also the management bless there heart is honestly either untrained or lacking in many departments also waiting for food and hearing young employees discussing there recreational drug use from the previous night is not something i think most hard working people want to hear about on there lunch breakshowed up at exactly 600 pm according to time on mobile and sorry we are closed  i mean exactly  then they told me i could transfer my prescription to prytania  not what id call good customer servicei wasted 7 bucks on a meal i thought was going to be awesome the fried chicken was stale and tasteless they had no more wings only drums at 4pm come on the fries were old im done smhordered mozzarella sticks and a small cheese pizza via delivery driver did not speak english food was okay until i discovered 2 hairs in my pizza that were baked into it will not eat here againwow what a disappointment after hearing others give such high marks this restaurant was horrible all the way around first our waiter was awful he did not check on us for probably 20 minutes the bartender served us our appetizers and we had no silverware after stopping another waiter to find ours for silverware he went and told our waiter and he still waited 10 minutes to come when he finally did he refilled drinks and left for another 20 minutes without bringing us utensils we eventually took them off a different table when our food was served to us and then he came and said he forgot 2 people in our party ordered drinks from the bar that were awful it was as if they didnt have a drop of liquor the food was just plain bad the pork steaks were like chewing rubber the sides were flavorless we were shocked after we started eating the only food that was okay was the kids mac n cheese and the bbq nachos dont waste your money youll end up leaving frustrated that you paid so much for horrible service and gross foodif i could give zero stars i would this is the worst run starbucks in the chain takes forever to get through the drive through painfully slow and rude barristas if they didnt have a contract with the shopping center they would be out of business because any other coffee shop would put them out of business in a heartbeat the two 5 star reviews on this store have to be fake reviews from employees because everyone who lives here knows this location stinksthis is the slowest drive through i have ever been in my entire life not sure how this survives why people continue to come back hereim here right now and this is my hell worst drink in history i meanthis margarita is  straight lime soda with a hint of urine if im ever diagnosed with cancer it will be because of this place and its awful bartenders most of this comment may sound like a joke but this place used to be wonderful before im assuming here its owners changed because when this was lolas it was dark and mysterious hip and fun now it looks and smells like an old dirty motel in vegas it sucks guys plus it overcharged us for drinkstoday me and my 4 friends went to cosi to enjoy the make your own smoreswhich we were very excited about we ordered a big tray of smores for the 5 of us and the person taking our order said he would bring our smores to our table upstairs after a few minutes he came upstairs to serve us our smores when he went to light the fire so that we could toast the marshmellows he said lit the match held it up and said a ritual as his eyes rolled back he said something along the lines of curse god for bringing fire to mankind and then lit our tray for our food it gave me and my girlfriends a very uneasy feeling and we went to speak with the manager right away the manager was really nice to us about the situation but she also wasnt surprised that it happened however she did fully refund us and gave us 2 free entree passes i just wanted to post this to the cosi facebook page so it doesnt happen again we also noticed at the end that he was handling the food without gloves and extra long nailslet me say that i wouldnt have been as harsh as some of the other reviewers until we were reading the reviews on the way home after a terrible experience and saying to ourselves yes that person is exactly right  i mean i wouldnt have gone so far as to say that the food wasnt smoked  the ribs had a smoke ring but the wings were not smoky    ok start over service was fine no issues was there on wed night  ayce crab night  place is rocking  im thinking wow popular  we had 5 things  1 st louis ribs were not burned at all  looked fine except lacking flavor and very tough  chewy  they were fresh for sure just not good ribs period  2  got 25 they were mostly dry and overcookedcharred  girl took them back and got us fresh ones from the kitchen  she happily agreed they were dryoverdone  said the cook agreed  2nd batch looked awesome  moist shiny hot except the only flavor they had was from what had to be some kind of baste they brush on when these are on the grill   was just an oily taste mixed with grill char  grit   they looked so different i told the owner its an insult that you served us that first batch of wings   cudos for bringing out more wings  they aint cheap  but these arent worth eating either  you could have offered me all you can eat ribs  wings and i would not have been satisfied at any price  its just a waste of a meal  3 fries that came with ribs were great  ordered a 2nd order 149 and they were not as good  left half  was really odd  4 baked beans have a saucejuice in them right  these were the goo that comes in the bean can  not much else added   open a can of van camps take a bite and thats what these were  ok still here here it comes   5 uncle mikes has a unique approach to doing some sides  most places would crack open a can of green beans and all all sorts of stuff to make them flavorful salt chicken base onions pepper etc    nope   not at mikes  they try to remove all flavor from their green beans   i actually tricked my wife into a bite by claiming awesome holy cow and then she spit hers out and gave me a nasty look while i laughed at her     talked with two other tables who were not happy either    place should do well except that the food is bad   good luck wouldnt expect them to stay open much longerthis place is not what it used to be the staff is anything but friendly and the cake is mediocre at best not to mention you will pay much more for a cake the same size as neighboring bakeries save your money morning and tastebuds and go to maurices or antoines cant say enough good things about either of those places but its definitely a pass on gambinosi dont even know where to begin this is the closest kfc to my house and it is the biggest disappointment every time i go there there is always something wrong for instance one night they were out of chicken tenders and mashed potatoes almost every time i go there they forget something in my order or get it wrong like ordering a number six and a number eight and only getting one number 6 or not getting any sauces that i asked for or 4 getting my cookie and my sauce and my utensils in the same order and theres always a weird smell coming from the window when i pull up for the drive thru and when i peek in it just looks like a mess of course the floor looks disgusting honestly i dont even know why i come back if i could give them zero stars i would but fortunately i cant so they get one star and i guess that one star accounts for the fact that everyone is always friendly at least theyre nicethis location is absolutely filthy dirty the food is cold and the employees are extremely rude i i dont know why people continue to come here and how they can stay open in this conditionliving in saint pete has made it easy to be vegan i travel alot and can always count on grabbing a veggie delight with spicy mustard today im having my sandwich made and im told this location discontinued it my whole life ive gone to subway and ive never heard of something so crazy get rid of basic mustard not spicy deli mustard for goodness sakes i wish i could say i will be returning but im not you just removed the only sandwich sauce that makes a veggie delight taste goodthe pizza is off the quality of the 199 frozen pizzas from the budget grocery store better off with a tonysi try to support local businesses encountered the most racistrude cashier yesterdaytotally supportedencouraged by management will never be back to get gas or anything thereguess you need to be a local service sucks meals take forever not like the pinocchios from the past i wont be coming back enjoy if your a local dont visit if your a strangerupdate from previous review their manager ali contacted me privately and assured all concerns were addressed and offered her apologies   hoping to see the results in a positive way  ill give this place a second chance  worst customer service ever not once was i asked how my food was coffee was served once with no cream and sugar i was there for 40 mins and not once was i asked for a refil my order was wrong  i left to pay inside at the cashier since i had been waiting 20 mins for someone to get my bill only to walk in on my servers chit chatting like they had no job to do  there was a server who was on his smoke break smoking outside in the public in front of me eating went back inside and started bussing tables without having washed his hands after smoking i left and called to talk to their manager alli  but while talking to her she sounded more annoyed at me than concerned and understanding and said ok sir i gotta hang up now  all i wanted was a nice place to have breakfast but tbh after today i would rather eat off roseanne barrs underboob than have to eat here and be treated like this ever againwalk in  kewl looking atmosphere  thats why they got the one star   me how old are the cupcakes  cashier oh they are fresh me i will take one chocolate one please  husband walks up hey i thought we were going to buy more  me we will after we try this one  as we walk out i open it and pinch off some of the cake it crumbles in my hand    take a bite   dry and old   give my husband a piece his verdict no better then mine     set the cupcake on a patio table outside the door   and walked away     moral of this story   liars never win  you lost a customer for life and a bad review   ooooh  and the little middle aged woman with the scowl  upon her face  your cake suckseasily the worst pizza in town wings were the only thing good crust is pre made and frozen pizza toppings are extremely low quality and almost non existent cheese is pre shredded and plasticky poppers are frozen bought product not house made   why send complimentary cookies that are so poorly madewanted fro yo on july 4 no notification of closingspecial hours on the website facebook or even posted on the door we were sternly told closed when we tried to open the door as we saw associates in their at 627pm other locations are open 118 which i discovered via their facebook pages very disappointed with this location and will not be backi placed an order for three kits back on april 14  i got a note from the owner about 2 weeks later that they didnt have the stock yet but would soon  now it is june 10 almost two months later and they have not responded to any of follow up messages or picked up any of my phone calls and i cant leave a message as the box is full  the website remains functional so i dont believe they have gone out of business but clearly there is something wrong  i wish i could write a good review as i believe in supporting local businesses but this is just not acceptablei have always loved chipotle and have never had a problem at any of the locations however now i am apprehensive about going back i stopped in the evesham township nj location last night to pick up dinner i ordered a bowl with chicken when i got home and proceeded to eat my dinner i was greatly disappointed the rice was terrible most of it was hard and crunchy i ended up throwing out the bowl and cooking something else for dinnerhow hard is it to pour liquid into a cup to the proper height of the cup i took the lid off and the coffee instantly starting pouring out not little drops but pouring out obviously overfilled and spilling in my truck on my clothes you dont want to leave room for cream and sugar thats fine dont fill it to the rim thinking nothing can happen last i check theres still gravity and pressure on earth so movement and grasping the cup will change the dynamics of the damn contents inside the cup peoplewe have been patronizing this restaurant for about 8 months  have had good experiences until last 2 weekends  this weekend we were told that it would take a while which we understood but after waiting 50 minutes and noticing that people who arrived 20 minutes after us were serve before us we complained  we were told that it was not their fault and never offered an apology  we will never visit that store again  we love firehouse subs and will go out of our way to avoid this location  they are extremely rude and care nothing about customer serviceplaced an order for delivery through ubereats and for some reason the order was not delivered called the restaurant and the young lady who answered my call couldnt care less about the order she told me my problem was with ubereats not them i explained that it was their responsibility to make sure that the order was delivered she rudely disagreed told me to go back to the app to get help i tried nicely to explain that she was wrong she wanted nothing to do with me and hung up needless to say i will be posting this unfortunate incident to every review site i can find reckless disregard for customersi have to say that good food was not even a redeeming factor for the experience my husband and i had we stopped by for a late breakfast and got simple sweet potato pancakes and eggs and sausage which tasted pretty darn good what made the experience so poor was the inattentive waitress and the high price of the meal for the amount of food we got the bill didnt seem to add up three hours later we both experienced stomach cramps and severe indigestion will not returnwe decided to try out this place again not sure how it usually works if you are suppose to seat yourself or wait to be seatedso we just decided to wait for someone well a couple of employees walked by and didnt acknowledge us one girl holding a tray of food came to us and looked annoyed asked how many and got some menus and proceeded to walk us to a table without saying another word there were only about 5 tables occupied food took foreverrrrrrr to come out my husbands food was burnt and he eats just about anything and it was hard for him to eat also almost broke a tooth on the burnt bits of what was suppose to be prime rib my sons food hes 3 took the longest to come out he got mac n cheese and it came out after sliders and a prime rib sandwich it was also scorching hot so we ended up having to pack it up cause it was just too hot to eat and we had already finished our food our waitress was super nice though but its obvious that there is no manager or anyone in chargeits kinda like a free for all from the couple of times ive gone i use to love parrot petes when it first openedcompletely not worth your time now there are so many better options elsewhereseriously 10 to park at a casino they should be embarrassed i cant believe they have started doing this i will not be backservice service service people   great food but in desperate need of a gm to manage the place  third strike youre outdont even waste your time with this place it was 758 and they kicked me out telling me they are closed worse ever they will never ger my bussiness ever do us all a favor and close down refuseing service and its not even 8 plus there was people insideive reviewed this establishment before at two stars because of their everworsening table minimums but wanted to return to take one of those stars away   charging for parking at the same time mgm resorts is being blasted for the practice in las vegas is shortsighted and absurd harp on about how much the tribe needs the scratch to build additions and complete renovations as much as you like but this is clearly a petty reaction to the recent unpleasantness in tallahassee charging for parking at a local casino like this is beyond brazen  its insulting  with apologies to darien c who might just have the worst job in the world defending asinine policies like this one  edit in reviewing other folks assessments of this place  a three star establishment here on yelp where scammers are monitored  i happened upon the facebook

next thing you know theyll charge by the cube of ice in your cocktail and by the sheet of toilet paper in the bathroom  edit 3 and now ive been blocked by their instagram account cant own up to their mistakes in a public forum sadworst jack in the box ever i had ordered a jacks spicy chicken sandwich with cheese and an order of tacos 2  when i was given the food i asked the guy to confirm that the sandwich had cheese and he said yes then when i got home to eat it guess what  no frickin cheese complete losers and the worst customer service ever i am definitely gonna complain first thing in the morningevery time i go here some girl is talking to her boys at the drive thru slowest and rudest dq i have ever seen when i got to the window my shake was watery and had been setting there the little girl basically said take it or leave it the manager seems to support this behaviorim done with this place every time i come here its either were not accepting credit cards or were out of service for the next 30 minutesits december 30 2013 and nobody is able to accept orders in the drivethroughim donecalling corporate hopefully i get a free hamburgeri decided to give this haggen location a chance i walked into an mostly empty store i notice some items that have been marked down in the deli due to product expiring the same day i take it up to the register the store manager was at the register she refused to honor the discount on the packaging and said it was a mistake haggen you can keep your expired foodnope wanted donair read the review only 2  might as well try it  3 workers make 1 order 1 order at the time so 3 orders ahead of mine leave 30min later brutal  taste ok worst wrap job ive ever had    full of regret just the factswas in this location today at 440 i ordered two 2 angus bacon and cheese burgers i asked for no onions which i got nothing but the cheese pickles bacon and meat on one and no bacon on the other as well as the lettuce and tomatos on either i feel completely ripped off i also tried to order a sweet tea which the girl at the counter told me they had no ice now this is the 3rd time ive been told that by this location that is completely ridiculous you serve drinks you should have ice this location is a very poor excuse for a restaurant  if i could give this place a zero star i wouldmy hubby was craving wings we pass here often and decided to give it a try i tried calling 4 times to preorder but there was no answer we got there and were greeted by a mumbling cashier i had to have her repeat what she was saying with each new statement i ordered a small boneless wing combo plain with sauce on the side my hubby ordered a medium traditional with the sauce on the side all the tables except for a small one were filthy a guy halfway bussed one table so we sat at the only clean small table near thr front window it was miserably cold  we waited 17 minutes for our order which was packed to go even though we said we were dining in  we however were happy to take it to go because it was miserable to sit there and shiver once we got home less than 2 miles away the fries were barely warm my husbands wings were partly covered with sauce since when does plain mean cover some with sauce if you want  my boneless wings also had some covered and some plain the fries have some fake barbecue tasting seasoning on them that ruins a perfectly good partly warm french fry another establishment i wont be frequentingplease do not waste your money you get exactly less than what you pay for horrible service rude employee messed up order without an apology or refund nasty unscrambled eggs on top of one slice of cheese hard bagel without butter and wrong meat never againare you serious the burgers are the size of a half dollar come on give people what they pay for i wont even waste any more time writing we purchased a coupon from living social and when we arrived at big dicks we were told that we needed to have called that morning to place an order and that they only do 10 orders a day  none of this was stated on the coupon and the staff there did nothing to make things right other than repeating its not our fault  the customers are penalized because of big dicks misunderstanding with living social and customers are also penalized because big dicks has a small smoker  while we were there another couple had the same experience and big dicks did nothing to remedy the situation  we ended up staying and the food was mediocre at best  as another reviewer raised in the south mentioned this aint it for good bbqthis place charges you 5 for a very small scoop of cookie dough and yet does less work than a bakery even an 8 oz glass of milk is 2 i couldnt believe it the interior of the place has five daughters bakery knockoff vibesdidnt like it im with a couple of traveling bands and when they sent me for some coffee they were not happy the coffee was bitter and burned people are cool but the joe got to gohell on earth  i typically enjoy the events in the city that bring people together this however reminded me of mardi gras back around y2k when i literally didnt have to put my feet on the ground the volume of people would just pick me up and carry me  i managed to walk over just fine  even at 4th and bainbridge it was tame  turning that corner at 630pm was insane    i tried to be a good sport i met up with some friends  we divided and conquered to get some variety and then we were to meet up and share  well we never found eachother again  i got put in charge of cheese curds at the cow and the curd  i hopped in line and waited about 5 minutes  the guy working the truck said next and the woman at the front of the line was not paying attention  he asked again she did nothing  nobody nudged her or cut around her so finally the guy just looked at us towards the end of the line and said theres no line come order  so the back of the line rushed the window the front of the line got pretty upset about it and i found myself arguing with a 12 year old over cheese curds  i quickly realized how pathetic and ridiculous this was and decided that i no longer had a taste for fried cheese from a truck that is always out and about in the city anyway  i was however in need of a drink so i grabbed a sixpoint which brought me back down to only hating things a little bit  i found nomad pizza around 2nd and south got 12 a pie ate it while enjoying a band that i wished would have played more covers finished my sixpoint and got the hell out of there  i did see enid reping the yelp table which was lookin good  i got a little pang of pride walking by there  i tried to come over and say hi but the jetstream of people wouldnt allow for it  i tried to slam on the brakes and got rearended by an oblivious suburbanmom on the phone pushing a doublewide stroller  no urban mother would ever invest in the doublewide  nightmarket where sophisticated adults actually fight with 12 year olds over cheese curds  never againa disaster from beginning to end  the front of house couldnt get their story straight  quoting different times seating people out of order creating a terrible first impression  overall service was very slow and they got 3 of our 5 meals wrong and really made no attempt to make it up prices are high for the food  it was ok nothing spectacular  i know they are new but they have a long way to go before i will go backover cooked burnt chicken just what i always wanted thank again for your great food arbys definitely isnt what it used to be used to be when you do arbys you knew you were getting good food now its the same as mcdonalds except for you pay twice as much arbys you lost another patronageplace has a great look and of course its always wonderful to be able to get a table when other places have lines out the door but that is the point you will not find a line here  the service was weak basic issues like not providing spoons for latte having to ask for an additional packet or two of splenda and the most significant no check up to see if food was okwhich it wasnt the red velvet pancakes were crispy brown and not velvety from being overcooked the waffle was diminutive and underwhelming and the stuffed french toast were crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside also a few basic items we are out of the breakfast hash was the only thing that seemed to hit the mark  the prices require good food and good service unfortunately it didnt hit those marks sorry so much potential unfilled   at least the beverage manager was very attentive once we communicated this to himi have been here several times and each time there is some sort of issue well today was the worst and last time i will be going here i was with a group of four and everyone but one person ordered something that needed to be cookedwarmed up the person that ordered the veggie sandwich lettuce tomato cucumber onions peppers was last to get hers and it was past 30 minutes we had to ask about it before they even started making it the are so unorganized and get overwhelmed by the lunch rushi stopped in for lunch and got the soup and sandwich special  server was very courteous and the coffee was pretty good  the rest was awful  the broccoli and cheddar soup tasted like last weeks dishwater and it came with about 25 oz or one half scoop of chicken salad  all this wonderfulness for 775  really  never again in this life timethis is the wrost applebees in philly  waitress rude i watching the the game there tonight and because i was muslim they changed it at my table i would never come back hererun by very rude asian lady who does not speak english and only point fingers you can not touch anything in this store plus its expensivethis place is awesome clean great decor great people alans the food was perfect  harriet our waitress was lovely  the staff broke out in song mid meal they all help each other out and seemed to enjoy working there   the food came out super fast and the menu has all the normal breakfast fare with several unique options as well  update  weve been coming back regularly and today we waited 1 hour 10 minutes for our food to come out after ordering  thats not the end of the world but for one detail  the kicker was that the owner  maybe he was a manager sat down next to us with his food and even told us our food would be out shortly no apologies from anyone  the food was as always great  were hoping this was a fluke but the owner was so disrespectfulthe location was rather clean and everything looked rather appetizing but when i attempted to buy something i waited for over 20 minutes while nobody acknowledged me and i could see and hear them just gossiping in the back it was probably just the night shift but that was my experiencei cant believe theyre charging 10 to park dont they get enough of our money already theyve lowered themselves to the lowest of the lowest moneygrabbing some balls i can tell you one thing for sure we will never ever be returning to this place biloxi is a drive up the highway but id rather go there than ever returning here if i could give them no stars would   by the way no hotel in biloxi charges so if i want to throw my money away ill go to brighton but if i want a decent chance of winning with free parking ill go to biloxithe people who work here are incompetent beyond belief they constantly get orders wrong and never in a good way such as giving you an extra  burger  or fries you didnt order the last straw for me was two days ago when they not only gave me the wrong burger when i only ordered two items but gave me the worst case of food poisoning ive ever had needless to say i reported them to public health and would warn everyone to stay away from this place if someone reported them to corporate im sure they would shut them down or change managementso sick  staff was terrible and the produce tasted funky now ive been sick for 3 days  im so sad because quiznos was my favorite for years and i was so excited to have one by my house againthis place is a joke my family went there on a saturday afternoon the place was just about empty there was no one to greet us for about 10 minuteswe were finally seated we didnt see a waitress for another 15 minutes mind you the place is just about empty when no waitress came over the manager came and took our drink orders i ordered coffee typically they bring a pot of hot coffee the coffee was lukewarm and i barely got 2 cups out of it clearly this pot was from another persons table because a full pot of coffee yields more then a cup and a half of coffee i watched as more people came in and waited to be greeted and seated i also watched people walk out because they werent greeted or seated i watched in amazement as the manager and another employee were at the front of the restaurant and neither of them greeted several guests as they cam in they just let them stand there while they continued talking this manager is a light skinned or biracial woman with curly hair she is horrible she is the one that brought me the used pot of coffee it took almost 1 hour for our food and againthe place was empty our waitress was the only bright spot in the horrible experience she was working several stations i watched one waitress wipe the same 2 empty tables 3 different times when our food finally arrived the guy that brought it to use only had 2 of the meals he looked at my sister and myself and said what did you have i will never darken the doorstep of this establishment ever again whoever manages this place needs to be fired immediately get classier staff and train them the staff looks like they just grabbed people off the street and threw aprons on them and told them to work horrible horrible horriblei ordered a taco pizza through the online portal thirty minutes elapsed 10 of which i waiting in store until they told me their store does not have taco pizza ingredients and that they do not know how i was able to order the pizza online what were they doing for thirty minutes from when the order was created to when they told me they didnt have the ingredients why was i not notified so that i didnt drive to the store this was a terrible experience and pizza hut is unprofessional and a disappointmentterrible place terrible service terrible customers terrible employees shut it downessene used to be one of my favorite places to get vegan hot bar food baked goods or other high quality vegetablesingredients new owners took over recently it is no longer a vegan paradise as one five star reviewer stated they do have many of the same items as before but they also have piles of boars head bacon where the hummus used to be the hot bar is no longer vegan instead of paper sacks  if needed they give out hideous heavy plastic bags i do not feel bad about going to whole foods anymore goodbye essene and to be clear it was the bacon that was the tipping pointthe donuts were underwhelming i had seen these on all the must visit restaurant sites for new orleans and was excited about it being that we were visiting the cashier was extremely rude and not helpful at all the donuts were over rated just a bunch of dense bready dough with sugary toppings not flavorful exciting or innovative theyre trying to be trendy but theyre failing i prefer basic donuts over this placethis place is the pits  they always forget something for example they didint give me any sour cream for my baked potato wth the service is bad especially at night they are just so rude  sometimes your fries are cold  if u can dont do fast food in upper darbyno no no no no this place is so dirty and gross ordered two shots of espresso lifted the cup and found a dead bug under my cup everything is sticky they also ran out of ciabatta bread so they put my panini on random wheat bread without even asking me if thats what i wanted the food also took forever and it wasnt even hot or goodive never waited for my hot and ready pizza wings and crazy bread as long as i did tonight 31 min not very organized messed up every order including minegood god food as crummy as this should be cheaper heres my review in 5 words bland poor quality and overpriced  go to free birds its right around the cornernever again ive hesitated to eat inside here since its been open because ive ordered take out a few times and had to wait forever for my order since there are no other ihop in my area we decided to try eating in since we were craving ihop pancakes shouldve known better when as as soon as we sat down i overheard a customer complaining to the manager that they waited for an hour for their food but our server assured us that it would not be like that with her our food didnt take that long but our server had the type of attitude that turns me off almost like she could care less whether or not we were happy or not she never checked on us and after  i asked for the bill she just handed it to me without a word i was a server and was trained the right way please train your servers to be nice and friendly this was on 11192016ordered a  vegetable salad already kind of weird that a salad is named vegetable salad but any way the vegetable salad consisted offrozen broccoli that was microwaved and then cooled cannedyes canned mushrooms soggy sliced unripened tomatoes still cant get passed the canned mushrooms on a salad and shriveled black olives delicately slopped together on a bed of romaine and iceberg lettuce  cannedmushroomsi hate giving them this review because their bagels are so good however this place has no official closing time  for the people who cant go here before work and must go at lunch they literally have zero bagels left after 1230 i understand they dont want excess but its so frustrating to spend half of your lunch break driving there just to find out that they are totally out of everything if you go there at lunch they are most likely trying to close and show their frustration at you for making them stay an extra 3 minutes if you can make it there in the morning go  otherwise find somewhere elsequick service but wtf is the dirtiest grossest place to sit or lean everything is broken and dirty theres literally pee on the floor and furnitures is falling apartthe worst chickfaila establishment there is and its not even close the employees are always rude and its clear they dont want to be there the order is almost always wrongive come here all of four times each time with an order of a 24oz creme brule cold brew and two out of those times got handed a 16oz instead the first time i had been in a hurry and waited 10 min and didnt want to wait another ten minutes for the right quantity so i chalked it up as an honest mistake and hurried to the office today i had to wait literally 30 minutes as apparently they werent getting orders from the machine i used and after some time they called for a collection of receipts to make drinks off of but then after i handed them my ticket to make the drink off of that the ticket just sat on the counter with no one making it some ten minutes later when the person at the counter asked if anyone was still waiting i spoke up and he reacted by crumpling the ticket on the counter with my order on it and then asking if anyone else had seen a ticket with such an order i found myself almost yelling its in your hand at which point a woman there finally agreed to make my paid for drink 30 min post ordering after verifying it was indeed written on the uncrumpled paper and yet even after reading the clear and concise order she of course hands me a 16oz cup i give up on this businessive never seen a ruder more miserable passiveaggressive person operating an establishment in any service industry anyone can get a good review or two by spending money with the local shinypapered lifestyle magazines what matters is when this wretched man has one of his mood swings and nothing suits him for the rest of the night   and thats why i wont ever go to this place again after giving it several chances not to mention the restrooms belong at a gathering of the juggalos condoms unflushed in a toilet spit i hope  all over the mirror urine all over the floor pubic hairs in the sinks and the spray they use to cover it up stinks as bad as the stale urine  i went here with my significant other several times over the past few years and every time its the same thing with this guy just a real awkward feeling he explodes on someone for nothing at all one time he thought my so and i were responsible for bringing smoke into the bar when we just walked in the door his bar back was on the steps smoking a cigarette what were we supposed to do wait for him to finish  we are the customers a competent leader would tell the employee not to smoke at the customer entrance and wouldnt take out his anger on an innocent paying customer  poor form he drags the mood down when he talks about employees and customers behind their back to other customers nobody wants to be involved in his problems thats what this man cant understand customers just want food andor drink hes not that important people choose to go elsewhere i dont want him talking to me about his bartender not doing enough work and causing him to spend the whole evening behind the bar helping out i dont care i just want the proper environment for enjoying food and drinks he isnt a part of that it sickens me to eat near the man  he has issues i dont want him serving or preparing my food or drinks i just dont trust him there are so many better choices in that neighborhoodme and a couple good friends tried dinardos for the very first time yesterday and i cant even put into words how disappointed i was from the watered down drinks too the overly priced crabs im a seafood eater i live for blue crabs so ive travelled all over to eat them i dont mind spending money for them but 32 for 3 crabs that are regular sized is outrageous a half of dozen for 64 smh and dont get me started on there seafood combination i paid 32 for 1 unseasoned extremely breaded crab cake 3 unseasoned shrimp 3 unseasoned scallops 1 very bland piece of flounder n 11 french fries so disappointed i will never go back there from someone whos in this field i couldnt believe they were totally robbing people on the prices like thati travel to baltimore and there crabs arent overly priced and thats crab city total disappointment and i felt even bad for my friends since i suggested this place wanting to support my city next time ill take the hour and a half drive to baltimore we were disappointed to learn that cafe square one would be closing at 6 today but such is life its summer after all    that is until i looked at my watch and learned that in addition to posting a sign that theyd be closed at 6 it was a bit after 5 and the doors were already locked the young staff sat idly while deliberately ignoring us and others outside   um isnt it silly to close earlier than the time at which youve posted youll be closing early just saying   one star for the rude staffomg the service was so bad  our server asked for our drink order and suggested margaritas but didnt mention they were 12 each brought the drinks and chips took our food order writing down nothingand disappeared  25 minutes later he showed up to ask what we had ordered not good asked if he had lost our order he gave us attitude about how busy he was and problems in the kitchen blah blah blah he again took our order and said he be right back with more chips and salsa that took another 10 minutes and all the tables around us were being served we called the manager and explained that we now had been waiting an hour for food and we had had enough thank you we were leaving we had never left like that before food may have been great but will not tolerate poor service not going back1 word gross   after reading and hearing all of the fantasic things about bulk barn i thought i would go in and see what they had to offer  so one day when jonesing for sugar a fellow sugar addict and i headed off to the bulk barn  i purchased a few of my favorite snacks from the bins licorice laces gummy bears and sour cream puffs to name a few my friend had an equally luscious load i probably dropped about 40 and she 50 we couldnt  wait to get to the car to twist open a few bags and start the sugar rush and when we finally got the bags open wow what a disappointment  my licorice laces were like eating the leather laces on my boots i might have pulled off a crown trying to dislodge a gummy bear from my tooth and my girlfriend was dry heaving beside me need i say more  thoroughly disappointing the most stale and vile junk food i have ever had the displeasure of eating the bulk goods must have been in those bins for who knows how long  that coupled with the occassional grubby hands dipping into the bins to steal samples when no one was looking disgusting in fact it was so bad we threw it all in the garbage  i learned a costly but valuable lesson that day and no  it wasnt to stop eating so much junk foodlol rather  to ensure freshness always buy your candy individually packaged   bulk barn gets a 5 popcorns downthe donuts and drinks lack flavor and are consistantly poor been 3 times shame really as there arent too many other options available near by coffee beans over roasted tea drinks are weak  even the hot chocolate could barely do more than look extremely similar to regular milk chocolate milk at the nearby gas station would have been so much better  donuts lacked initial flavor and went down hill from there i love donuts i follow donut stores on instagram from around the world this was the presliced white loaf bread at the grocery store equivelant  mushy unfulfilling on all levels and a pale shade of what it could have been there is no reason fruit fillings shouldnt taste of fruit chocolate be some variation of plain and a there should never be a moment when someone compares a donut to presliced store bought white breadthey give you noooooooo meat ive tried them about 3 times and each time they give me like half a spoon of meat today i wanted half chorizo half steak and i swear i probably got 3 pieces of chorizo in my bowl so furious  its not like you can say anything bc they always give a dirty look and a smart remark about not being allowed to serve more i pay to eat a meal not to get served what you would feed a fish never coming to this location again recommend you making the extra trip to the one in tyrone they know how to actually portiongo to any other cvs go to riteaid go anywhere but here shortstaffed rude on the verge of obnoxious i will not be backflavorless wonton flavorless pork and seasoned deep fried bread crumbs  apparently they forgot to put the chicken in the bread crumbs i would have been better off going to the food court at least they dont rip you off ok the green tea was nice and warm the way it should be right even the table next to us couldnt identify what they were eating again do yourself a favor and take your money and go get gas station sushi insteadi have worked in the promenade on and off for the better part of six years i typically bring my own lunch to save money but sometimes i want to buy usually ill go to chipotle as it is around the corner from where i work but b good caught my eye and i decided to give it a try  first i went for an early dinner about 530 on a monday night there were no lines and plenty of seating available which was awesome i got the cousin oliver burger no onions with cheddar cheese and fries i opted for the whole wheat bun when asked what kind i wanted  the fries were just okay they werent horrible overly salty soggy or burnt but they werent the pop shop fries either my personal gold standard theyre perfectly crispy and salty every time i tried the b good brand ketchup and wasnt impressed it was too sweet but the consistency was good props for not using corn syrup either  as for the burger given that this place is known for its burgers i was severely disappointed i found the burger to be quite dry as opposed to juicy and not very flavorful the bun was also dry the portions were a decent size a little smaller than say a burger at a chain like chiles or applebees but not by much   about a week later i was in the area again and craving a milkshake so i got the 16oz chocolate it will set you back about 5 which i thought was pricey my taste buds detected vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup which was disappointing especially since i could get the same thing at mcdonalds for less if that was what i wanted which it wasnt if you dont mind shakes being syrupytasting and overtly sweet youd like it fine ill satisfy the craving next time by making my own  everything here is sold separately so prices can add up quickly a burger is about 7 add cheese for another 1 and fries for 3 they do have a combo option to get fries and a fountain drink they have a few interestingsounding lemonadetea options for 4 so you save a little a medium drink regularly is 179   i get that you pay more for locally sourced and organic ingredients sometimes which is fine if the food is high quality i didnt think b good was   for a little less money and a lot more food ill stick to crossing the street and getting chipotle its much more satisfyingok lets start by saying way understaffed ordered breakfast potatoes hard not cooked  took 3times to get scrambled eggs i ordered they were cold and soggy wet undercooked pancakes so cold the butter did not melt they took them back and microwaved them instead of a fresh new platetoast cooked on one side not both sidesthat was the mealthe woodwork and doors look like they have not been cleaned for a very long timeoverall dirtynever going backi placed my order at 605 pm its now 825 pm i have still not received my order when i called the person that answered the phone he was extremely short and rushed me off the phone no apology no refund just extremely rude i called them 4 times and two of the 4 times he put me on hold or hung up i only selected this restaurant due to it saying a delivery time is 45 minutes customer service can and should go a long way to make any organization thrive this company needs to figure out a plan of action to get this fixed or they will not last long even a simple courtesy call to say we are running behind would have gone a long way i still am hopeful my food comes soon because im still hungry if the food is good ill be sure to let you all know if and when it ever arrivesaweful management and customer service  i have used this place a few times in the past but i will never recommend and i wont go back  i was splashed a glass of ice water and ice from my left side by our server  she was worried about the wet floor than the soaking wet customer and i had to ask her to bring me napkins or towels to dry myself half of my body and my little waist pouch were soaking wet  i knew it was a total accident and i was wearing a work out clothes i didnt make a huge deal but it was a big deal  the problem is that no manager on duty came to apologize neither no special treat on our bill  the dining area was deserted and the entire service was so slow  very suspicious food handling as well  servers should not grab the top rim of glasses but our server did  hope she washed her hands before serving  i did the survey and emailed this incident through their website no contact was made from them even though the site showed i would be contacted they lie too  awfulmy husband and i drove out of our way tonight thinking they were open late because we called and their message stated their hours are 6am to 11pm fridays and saturdays  long story short we got there and they were closed an employee told us they changed their hours last year and hed tell his manager to change the message that seems a little long to have not updated your hours on your phone message also in the few minutes we were there about five or six other cars pulled up to the drive through and then drove off looking confused so were not alonehorrible service and store layout ive been to this place multiple times and each time i have ended up getting someone elses sandwich i asked the service staff twice to make sure that i got the correct sandwich but still they messed up the order not going to come to this place ever againi work nearby to this location so i usually stop by most mornings i never order anything too difficult however it almost always seems to be messed up ive gone to this location for about a year now and there always seems to be a different group of employees working every time im there high turnover rate maybe at any rateim just writing this because im fed up fed up that ive complained to management once before and it did nothingand im fed up because really how hard is it to listen to someone when theyre speaking and make sure a coffee is correct i dont understand im paying money to you and in turn you mess up my order i cant tell you how many mornings ive gotten to work with my coffee and had to pour it out because its wrongtastes bad or had to park and go inside to have it remade im dumbfounded really management needs to get it together and drill in the employees heads to pay attention to what you are making and make sure its correct before you pass it out the window its not a hard concept i still love dunkini love their coffee and i love the prices even more but lets be realim not going to continue giving my money to a company that gets something so simple so wrong almost every single time fed upyelp should really consider the concept of no stars or even negative stars i have one star because i had to  i work just off of wash ave and went to the poor house tonight on suggestion of one of my co workers never again will i be back everyone in the bar looked at us when we walked in like we were interrupting some sort i vip party the bartender was just as icy one of our party played the juke box and what was played was obviously not what the crowd wanted to hear even though none of them were putting their money in to play music one girl shouted across the bar to the bartender to turn off this crap which she did she skipped our music even though we had paid money to hear it when we said something to her she acted like she had no idea what was going on how rude to treat any paying customer like that because the bar is full of your friends we are all industry people there is usually a large group of us we drink heavily and tip well i hope the owners if this business just realized how much money theyve lost tonight all because of an out of control bartenderone of the worst brownies that i have ever had the brownie was very dry and extremely hard i was barely able to eat it with a plastic spoon the chocolate was just bitter definitely will not be a returning customertldr dont even waste your time by parking in the lot  seriously cheddars do you guys just not want to be in business or did you put some sort of tracking device on people who leave you horrible reviews  my family and i tried cheddars a second time thinking that the dumbass waiter from last time would have been fired already and we could finally enjoy a meal here well i guess the manager or whoever trains the waiters is the problem holy cow if you guys cannot seriously take an order even for drinks within 30 minutes of us being seated dont seat the people walked out again  we wanted to try your food and have a good time if you dont like being informed of problems and instead are happy to see customers leave close your businessive been trying to get in this place since it opened weeks ago but the line was always too long this time the lines were non existent after sampling 7 different items on the menu i can see why in a nutshell the food is terrible the pulled pork sandwich was dry as the sahara potato wedges were bland tasteless and soggy  not to mention the larger ones were undercooked  the mashed potatoes were like trying to eat a container of white playdoh how about the fries  listen if you cant make french fries crispy then stop making them maybe salt on them would help but probably not the mac and cheese had zero flavor and the texture made me think it was microwaved mac and cheese from the dollar store sitting on your countertop for a few hours the fried chicken breading flavor wasnt terrible but it was wet and soggy thats a no no its fried chicken for gods sake crispy please  lastly the  biscuits what can i say dry and tasteless did i say dry i did big disappointment one star is too much for this joint i give the place 6 monthswe took lunch buffet only the nun was good else were not at all tasty there were not so many items as we expected all we can say it does not deserve more than one starbeen there twice screwed up order both times should i try for  third time a charm   not  hate that chicken at popeyesthe food and beer were all good i would have given them 5 stars but the bill came and my experience was ruined i spilled some of the bbq sauce while cutting the ribs so i asked for more bbq sauce which i got  i was charged 50 extra for the tiny cup of extra sauce ok its not about the cost its the principal who does that i brought up the charge to the waitress and she took it off the managers stance was a confusingyou didnt pay for the extra sauce to we charge extra for sauces such as guacamole to  the waitress pushed the wrong button he was confused but definitely not apologetic  no one should have to pay extra for a tiny cup of bbq sauceworst experience bartender was a total asshole rushed us the whole time hounded us for the bill drinks were over priced for juice and barely any liquorthis was the worst milkshake i ever had   no flavor other than a sort of freezer burn taste like the ice cream was old and had been in the freezer way too long  it was very unpleasant and i did not finish it  this was the first time i had been to gibbys in years  it will be years before i go again if everi really liked this place  it is a shame that they offended my wife by letting her hear two of the employees making fun of us  the food is good  the employees at least two of them are immaturelet me first say that i really like beefs but i will not be coming back to this one ever  when the floors are sticky and there is no water pressure for the sink in the dirty rest room and it takes 30 minutes to get an order for 4 people wings a salad and a burger and the seat covers have huge holes in them its time to close shop or as a customer find another restaurant the wings were good the salad was warm and limp the burger over cooked the service was bad exceedingly so and there were only 45 other tables occupied while we were there and no parties larger than 5  what a wasteworst pizza i have had in a while tasted and looked like a repackaged dominos pizza go anywhere else but here sausage looked like guinea pig turdsafter waiting for 40 minutes we received our 2 meals 2 sandwiches which were 32 i asked once about our meal politely and without an apology i was told this doesnt usually happen after reading more reviews apparently it does happen more than they are aware of i wont be returning since to me its not worth itabsolutely the worst gas station ive ever been to first the urinals looks like someone has crapped in them from not being cleaned  store is filthy and when i go to check out there are 3 cashiers but only 1 is open and her name was sunnie and the whole time she was checking the lady and myself out of line shes is stuffing her face with a hotdog  pure trashwhy do i have to keep leaving updates i spoke with the district manager she was super nice and promised to mail me a gift card to compensate for the horror i experienced that was in january its almost marchbe careful with the drinks sangria is more like koolaid and the wine was going badi hadnt been to yolklore since summer 2016 when they opened i went on a weekday morning and ordered the nest egg biscuit crust 2 buttonwood eggs bacon bits cheddar pickled red onion preserved lemon and a hot tea just as i had done previously i still find the community seating situation here a little uncomfortable and intrusive  my breakfast can best be described as a hot mess the biscuit crust was heavy the eggs were cold like they had been precooked and sitting out for a long time the pickled onion just tasted like raw onion and i dont think the preserved lemon was even present  the place was filthy the hot tea was cold never againordered the power bowl salad and the chicken was cold and dry also the greens were so salty i had to ask for a new salad sans salt    most of the food is crazy high in calories if you calculate  it isnt really a health spot as it seems the service was good thoughif i could put no stars i would i ordered my pizza online when i got to the store to pick it up i waited at the counter for 10 mins no one came out to check and see what i needed i even yelled for someone and no one came but i could hear them laughing in the back so i left i called and asked to speak with a manager who was very rude and didnt seem too care about losing business i will never go back to this store and will stick with west shore pizza and hungry howiesi would give it zero or negative stars if i could    its authentic you can only get service like this in beijing  we were a large group seated without asking in the group room  we never saw a server for over 30 minutes even though we went into the main restaurant and asked the server to come take our order  when we finally got to order we were told the group room cannot order the lunch specials  we ordered off the regular menu  nothing special in the food department definitely not worth the 45 minute wait    dont go herewait was long staff was completely lost and delivering the wrong orders food was cold and sauce had no flavor we wont returni was a huge fan of this panera not so much anymore i would eat here often 3 days a week last week i orderd french onion soup upon opening the soup and stirring there was hair about 8 inches long i approached an employee about my issue he implied i must have put it there just an fyi im a bald guy not sure how or why i would be able to put a hair in my own soup highly disappointed and disgusted i will never returnstopped in her for lunch the other day and was not impressed  came in with expectations of getting a salad and a small something for a 23 month old  disappointed that there were no kid options but understood that we are kind of in the business district  we ended up getting a half of a grilled cheese that was so toasted it was difficult for me to eat and close to impossible for the baby  my salad arrived with no dressing  fail number one i got the dressing and began to eat the salad when i took a few bites and felt grit in between my teeth i discovered that there was visible dirt in my lettuce  super fail  please please please wash your lettuce before serving to guests ive never had an issue with this location until now i went through the drive thru and ordered 3 entrees after getting home my husband and i began to chow down on our food i always look at my food before each bite and im glad i do otherwise i would never have noticed the long nasty hair wrapped in my food it is definitely not my hair because i have black hair the hair in my food was light brown lets just say this ruined my appetite and i will never come back here again disgustingwent there for lunch did not finish the food was boring and the service was rude chicken very dryi love chipotle but this location cant keep up and they didnt even have food prep at 1200pm come on lunch time they were scraping from bottom jugs to give left over to customers while we were all there waiting till they cook their food unreal i left when one staff member tried to give me old chicken left over very disgusted  1 star is giving them a lot the park location is not goodwont be going here again came in for an early dinner with my boyfriend and was ignored by the staff for 10 minutes despite having no other customers when we were eventually seated our waitress was rude and chose to socialize with other staff members rather than be attentive to her tables besides the poor customer service the price was too high for the portion and quality of food my boyfriend and myself both had pasta i was very disappointed by my experiencei ordered a large pizza from here despite reading from several reviewers who never got their order i got a call from the driver around the estimated delivery time and i answered and said that id be right out to which he replied that hed been banging on my door for some inordinate amount of time and that i could forget about my pizza the idiot was banging on my neighbors door and never thought to call me until after he decided not to give me my pizza while he was yelling at me i tried to explain the concept of a single street address having multiple apartment numbers and reminded him that he had my apartment number and phone number but he wasnt having any of it well thats a hard address to deliver to he said in 3 years of almost daily delivery to this address no one has ever had a problem before it blows my mind that you could reach the point of rage quitting before the point of deciding to call me what an unbelievable moronunfortunately the food was so boiling hot overcooked and bland that the service was irrelevant i had potato leek soup and then salmon pasta really awfulits truly a shame because this place would actually be better if the people running it were more efficient and more personable the lady who took our orders really messed up and when i pointed  this out to the manager i didnt even get a simple apology and then to make matters even worse our orders came so lateunfortunetly i had to go back for a third visit  i could not get out of it anyway  i did go with an open mind hoping things had changed i was not disapointed the only reason i gave 1 star is because i couldnt give none this may be the worst diner that i have ever gone to ever   i thought i would try something easy that they could not mess up i now think that is impossible they even serve cold toasted bagels  the only thing that was more shocking than the food was how dirty it was if you want to get your day off to a bad start then by all means go here stay away tuna tasted spoiled and oldim starting to feel sick and the bread was very stale tack i should get my money backi have been at a slowe mcdonalds in my life i go there because i work in the mall with limited time i sat 10 minuted waiting for a soda i went elsewhere unrealwe stopped in for fried chicken because it smelled great outside it was 430 on a sunday and i didnt feel like cooking dinner we ordered 12 piece chicken 2 orders fries 2 orders onion rings and cole slaw fried chicken received was not cooked fresh it was dried out  it was terrible the fries were fine cooked fresh no salt was added the onion rings were diced kind like burger king the pictured rings were whole homemade looking kind so they were misrepresentation  rings made fresh  were ok but i was disappointed  cole slaw was prepackaged type also also a dissapointmenti have purchased for both work and personal with the exception of a very few every cake here over the past 20 years  i have recommended this bakery for cakes to everyone who asks and being in the food business this would not be few  i live in wilmington and work in bryn mawr and have even driven 36 miles from home to get a cake for a special occasion  because yes the cake is that good  on thursday i found myself needing a last minute cake for my husbands 50th birthday as our plans to go away had to be changed  i tried to overlook our cake not being decorated as id requested  while in the store i referred to one there that had pretty orange flowers the one i picked up had giant green flowers with just 2 orange ones in other words mostly green  i know things get lost in translation some times  i asked if the cake would be ok overnight as his birthday was today i held the cake overnight in my pantry which is cool about 55f  tonight when i took the cake out to present it the big ugly orange and green flowers were so heavy 3 of the flowers slid down the one side of the cake  i fixed it best i could to present it  i wish i didnt feel like reporting this to the bakery would just end up in more frustration on my part  despite my many many visits and loyal patronage of this bakery when ive had questions or anything special to request too often the response is totally inappropriate i guess you can say this as the last straw  the reason i will not likely ever return to bakery house  which is totally ridiculous  if it werent for the many many examples of poor customer service arrogant dismissive attitude id never think to hesitate to bring this to their attention  i could be wrong but just cant take a chance of letting them add insult to injury  i do not feel this bakery backs their products 100 and cares about customer satisfaction the only consolation to this experience is being able to tell this story to everyone who asks why i stopped going to bakery houseby far this is the slowest dd in the area even if youre the only one in the drive thru itll take about 10 mins for 1 coffee i waited 25 minutes last friday with only 2 cars in line the inside is not busy enough to warrant the long wait in the drive thru i dont know who owns this location but it needs some serious work with speed  training they also often get coffee orders wrong or dont add the flavor im constantly checking before i pull away to make sure its correct there are a few gals who work the window that are very friendly so i will give them thatworst arbys ever food is always cold you may as well slap a 5 on the counter and say just give me some food cause whatever i order it wont be it forget it this place sucksi always buy 3 flour carne asada tacos for less than 6 bucks imagine my big surprise when i went with 6 dollars and now i could only buy 2 tacos they went up from 185 to 250 there is  no extra meat they are not bigger no difference so no reason for a 35 increase however they are very good but i think if the had gone up to 200 it would have been more reasonablemy family and i had probably the weirdestworst dining experience here it seemed as if they werent prepared to handle customers and the waitresses seemed stressed to the max i guess the best way to describe it would be unprofessional the food is also overpriced for the small portions that are served everyone in our group left hungry one person got their pizza just as everyone else finished eating their meals although the food itself was good i wouldnt recommend this restaurant or return there are many other places to choose from on main streetwasnt good today we came in and the place reeked like someone just smoked weed homeless people looking for food and bothering even checking the trash can this place hasnt been busy lately the owner should wonder what their employees are doing and why its not busy vgood concept and location was looking for a local place to have a nice cajun dinner with live music with a small menu you wouldnt think they would be out of salmon on a saturday night at 730pm but they were so we ordered the tace salad and a an appetizer never have i had to give up on a salad but it had an earthy dirt taste the cajun appetizers of crab cakes and the seafood beignet were bland the beignet mostly tasted of fried coating the music had a cool vibe which you pay 5  sadly disappointed and out 70 by way of separate checks automatically we werent asked two women together can be on one billsitting here right now  floor is so greasy its like skiing no bathrooms here so had to go across the hall and someone had puked in the sink  bathroom was dirty in other ways too  no way to dry your hands dryer or towels server was nice so one star for heravoid the asian deli at all costs food looks great but has sat out for hours at improper temperature these people are petty theives nothing is priced in nyc this is against the law they also do not take off the weight of the container and put your utensils on the scale they do mention  that if you put in an extra tea bag  its 50 cents they prey on tourists  take a walk a few blocks to the reading terminal youll be glad you did also chinatown is just a few blocks to the west   they charge you by pound  899 for bananas and jello avoid this place im  a tour bus operator and this whole place is a shamservice is unbelievably slow perla the manger is in the back doing her makeup while the timer for me is ticking away the lady that came in after me had to wait till perla finished her makeup to even get a nod at the counter the rest of the help acts as if they are on a downer waltzthe worst experience ever  we went in and we had been to an event earlier in the day we were quiet and reserved but someone next to us decided we were not what they seemed as suitable neighbors no foul language or inappropriate comments were used however management decided to not observe the situation and provide derogatory comments to use we will never patronize this dstablusjmentwell this happened back in february and despite an email to corporate no one from the company has acknowledged the plastic in my food or even bothered with a simple apology so i guess its time to write a review in february 2018 i ordered a cobb salad a cup of soup and a drink for delivery i ate at baggins about once a week since its close to work and this time i ordered for delivery my food was 15 minutes late with the wrong salad dressing and no fork or straw annoying but not a deal breaker as i was eating my food i noticed a bright green strand in my salad i was starving so i got rid of the hair and everything it was touching and continued to eat then i noticed what felt like a hair in my mouth i pulled it out and it was another green strand i took a closer look at my salad and noticed little green strands all through it after further inspection it looked like little pieces of plastic like shredded up pieces from the mesh bags onions potatoes or apples come in i was disgusted and worried about how many of these little plastic pieces i invested i threw the rest away i then wrote to the corporate email address from their website politely explaining what happened and asking for some sort of explanation and hoping for some reassurance that what i ate was not harmful that was over four months ago and apparently little bits of plastic in a customers salad is not important enough to acknowledge so if you are hungry for some plastic baggins is your place if youre like me and prefer to only ingest food during your meal go somewhere elsewhen this bubble tea store just opened i ordered 2 bubble teas and they were very good so today i came here again and ordered the same one as i ordered last time however it was extremely disappointed the tea itself tasted like water and the boba tasted so not fresh and tasted sooo hard i would say this is the worst bubble tea i have never tried in my life so i asked the guy who made the bubble tea for me the reason why the boba tasted so hard he was not able to explain the reason and did not apologize either after he checked my bubble tea for a few mins he asked me if i would mind he takes out the bobas from my drink and ask me to drink without bobas what  as he was not willing to remake one for me or asking me if i would like to order a different drink if the boba is not fresh i left immediately without taking back my drink or asking for a refund i would have to say this is very disappointed and i would not come back again i wouldnt say it was the his fault but i would say he was not fully trainedi have been here 3 times now and 2 out of the 3 times i have had an issue the first time they gave me a sundae in a plastic up with a slit up the side that leaked all over my car the second time they didnt give me the blizzard i ordered i am rather disappointed lesson learned double check your orderpoor customer service guy in the drive thru had attitude when i was ordering then we couldnt wait at the window for our food they asked us to pull around front to wait for it be ready we were the only people in the drive thru i have worked at multiple fast food places and i never treated the costumers with attitude yall need to train your employees and managers betterwent there  930 ordered breakfast burrito left  947 no burrito after setting and waiting for 15 minutes the guy from behind the counter informed me it would be a little bit longer i waited 2 minutes and left empty handed i dont have the free time that they have i guessi tried this frost and came to the same conclusion it was no good and was overpricedjust like the others i have triedthis is the worst dunkin coffee is never right food has a weird chemical taste rather drive a few more miles to avoid this placewent into petit piquant to get something to eat and needed to use the restroom first and they said we dont have one you can try the library which was closed needless to say scary part of town walking next door to the library i went back and said anywhere else they said gas station down the street no thanks homeless people and sketchy outside everywhere now was going to go to the bathroom after breakfast ordered the short rib benedict that was on their menu and they said they didnt have it they didnt have a restroom for customers or food that was on their menu  i wont be backthey dont listen and forget things nasty ketchup station and fries are almost always not fresh the food is bad for you anyway overly processed and chemicals gmo more of a reason not to returnvery disappointed one of my crabs had small black bugs in the crab meat i was told they are seasoning they were bugs and absolutely not seasoning  their crabs were not fresh do not godont come in at 928 after a movie even though they dont close until 10 even if you order quickly and skip appetizers and dessert they will make you feel as awkward as they can and make your food inedible i love spicy food so i ordered the vegan vegetable curry  medium and it was the spiciest thing ive ever tasted it left my lips burning and my stomach churning the waiters response itll open up your sinuses my girlfriend got hers mild and it was still spicy but at least edible i attempted to finish my meal as i hate wasting but simply could not we finished hers and paid for both as we were leaving we noticed we were both more bloated than we have ever been before though we didnt even eat much food they clearly did something to the food out of spite their displeasure was obvious from the moment we walked in   i have worked in restaurants at all levels so i know the feeling when customers arrive late at night and you just want to go home ive had people come in 5 minutes prior to closing but we still treated them with respect but this is ridiculous  this was by far my worst dining experience and i would advice all others to avoid this place at all costvery disappointed in this place it is usually great  today is my birthday and i really wanted breakfast from district  i waited in line for 20 minutes and got to the counter at 1058 breakfast was ended early and the person behind the counter just shrugged and said sorry we decided to end breakfast  people wait in long lines for this place and i really expected better  you lost a customer todayhonestly i dont understand how a successful establishment can have no heat meanwhile it is 15 degrees outside this is simply ridiculous especially being i have been waiting for my food for over 30 mins  i am sitting here and can see my breath from the cold inside what is the point of buying food to go when it is going to take forever and the owner wont provide a comfortable place for their customers to wait during these extreme temperatures invest in your business beginning with proper temperatures in your current stores not just expanding just like our federal government federal donuts is big on promises but also just like the federal governments policies it looks done on the outside but on the inside it is uncooked and raw that can be passable in a donut not really but when you are dealing with chicken this will not stand  if it wasnt for the undercooked food i still would not find much to rave about although i will say that the young woman behind the counter was friendly and patient as i asked questions about the menu   having tasted everything from and between great gourmet donuts to terrible homemade donuts federal donuts rank towards the bottom sorrywe were told there was a 25 minute wait and asked to sit outside an hour later the hostess led us to an inside table she had forgotten we asked for an outdoor seat  the drinks came out ok bloody mary was excellent make your own but not all drinks came out at the same time st germaine cocktail was the best part of the meal we requested whole milk for the coffee and were given 2 we waited at least an hour to be served our food all the while we asked three times for the staff to turn on the ramspackers game it seemed like a challenge to figure that out   when the food finally came out it was cold and didnt all come out at the same time one dish called for avocado and it wasnt included we asked for well done potatoes they were delivered underdone and then when sent back were never reserved  management did end up comping 2 out of 5 meals and asked if we wanted free pastries the food was mediocre at best never againplaced an order of wings and bread sticks and had it delivered noticed that the wings had the wrong sauce on them so i called the pizza hut to let them know i called at 850 pm and was told that wings would be remade and delivered back out to me 3 hours the later the store is closed and no food was received if you can try and do take out from one of the other pizza huts and save yourself the troublehey starbucks  when its slow  customer service is even more important the woman on drive thru duty identified by the headset waited on me when i walked in the silence between us was awkward for me because i never know if they are listening to someone outside i waited for her que i ordered my cocoa she made it personally two of her coworkers were busy behind the counter no one said thank you i loved the way my order was announced  just like when they are busy im a grande hot chocolate there were no other customers anywhere  inside or outside went home across the street one full inch of room i noted upon arrival  within 3 minutes thought it would have whip called to ask if it comes standard yes indeed the reply well not in mine woman with attitude at this store and no team to help her out baby its cold inside i am more sure than ever i must cut the cord to you starbucks goodbyeeven with a discounted tickets using groupon this tour was a waste of money  the guide must have been new because he didnt have the background and stories that we had hoped to hear about the history  and blending of cuisine in cajun and creole cooking it was the only tour we took that we werent warned to stay together and keep a portion of the sidewalk clear for other passers by in some instances he didnt even stop to address the group zbut rather talked as he moved forward with all following behind needless to say we didnt hear much of what he did try  to say  if this tour happens everyday it was not well organized 2 of the 4 restaurants we visited were not prepared for us and we were left standing on the corner or outside the door in one instance i had to tell customers that there was not a line to get in or the restaurant would have lost those customers  the restaurants we visited were generally 2nd class with somewhat bland jumbalaya an ok gumbo and poboy the nicest surprise was a little pizza shop that made their own focacciaa bread and offered  a nice variation on a muffaletta little vics not necessarily traditional but nice oceana napoleon house tujague were  the others  in general the afternoon was a disappointment and i could not recommend this tour  i have no complaints about portion size as it was just a taste of new orleansdump without a doubt the filthiest restaurant ive ever stepped into  slow night but every table was still dirty  instead of cleaning they wanted to seat us at the only table that was clean  they did not want to clean any tables i found out why when i passed by the kitchen they had huge piles of dirty dishes piles up in the back  the cooking station was filthy  we couldnt get out of there fast enoughdont ever go here service is really slow we ordered 3 bento boxes plus noodles and we all got the bento boxes within 15 mins but the noodles took  35 mins they prioritize the bubble teas which isnt even that great and the cashier lady was really rude with taking the orders and giving the orders 05 would not recommend going herethis subway is ridiculous a friend who lives nearby and i went to eat there at about 745800 pm and they had already locked and closed the doors they were still in there and saw us wanting to come in but just completely ignored us it was horrible and pathetic   so we walked down to the nearest place that had food which happened to be a burger king but i was in the mood for a subnasty place nasty employees i used to order from this place at least one a week recently i had super cold fries bad attitude from the teenage drive through employees  i felt like i was begging them for my food i pay for my food and i expect to be treated like a valued customer lately this place has been a disaster as far as customer service goes  i advice the owners to replace the management and all the drive through kids before its too late  i also advice all customers to stop going to this place if you wanna treated like a customer go somewhere else have a great daythis is my first one star rating  cosis at 30th street station is an avoid  i dashed in there at 4pm hoping to eat something before 430pm train left the station  since amtrak has sovietized the train food to the point that i couldnt bear one more microwaved hot dog  so outwitting amtrak i went to cosi with a business colleague  we had standard orders and got the number gizmos  wait wait  you wait here ill get some reading  i have time to buy some newspapers magazines and come back  wait wait  the only ones with any urgency and me and my colleague  420pm  trains at track 5  now its 425pm  gotta go  trains here  finally the first order appears and then mine  and i ask one question is there plastic ware  knife fork  in the bag  oh yes the woman says authoritatively     dash to the train  no knife  so i have to go to the amtrak fivestar dining car     i had a salad from cosi that after two bits was inedible asian chicken  and the bacontomatochicken sandwich  c  this cosi counts on the fact that if you have a complaint you will be 30 miles from the cosi before you discover youve been had  the staff is indifferent to your train plight and counts on the train to whisk away your complaint  avoid this cosithey are so unorganized  confusion from start to finish  the food quality is fair but that is all i can give it  the managerbartender is a loudmouthed shrew who smells like cigarette smoke as well as most of the other servers  note to servers  please dont smell like smoke when you approach  table  its disgusting  it interferes with my enjoyment of the food which is not too much  also do you have a liquor license or not  some days its free others it is not  please advise us as to the policy   also by hiring servers who are in school you are not keeping the money in nola they will eventually leave you and start anew somewhere else  hire those with a vested interest in the city those who will eventually buy a home here pay taxes and keep the money made here local   owners must be mindless as well save your money and eat elsewherewow i could not have had a worse experience i asked if they were sure they were using skim milk and they said yes  as i watched them make it with whole milk when it arrived it was tepid and not at all hot and i didnt even like the taste although maybe if it were the right temperature it would taste better what a horrendous six dollar cup of coffeei hate to say this starbucks is becoming the worst every time i go they are out of pastries and sandwiches also they tend to miss my request for alternate milk or an espresso shot ive been a few times when they closed the drive thru this location has limited parking so it was mass confusion when this happened this is really unfortunate since this is the closest starbucks in the areathis place came recommended by our hotel we were hoping for just simple hamburgers and craft brews unfortunately our medium well burgers came burnt to a crisp and too salty to eat both brews we tried did not taste good to us and we drink a lot of craft beer we had to eat outside given the inside smelled like sewerthis place will be out of business in two weeks waited 45 minutes for a bbq shrimp poboy and it had 4 shrimp on it not bbqd  used to love but bad now needs zero star postmy wife and i visited this location recently for beer and wings and was surprised to not see a soul in the place we figured that since beefs is a well known joint that people would be hanging around on a wednesday night but definitely not the case here while the beer was crisp and the service decent our wings were by far the most disgusting pieces of meat that we have ever eaten they were super tough and basically inedible my wife even noticed one of the wings being raw i consider myself a wing aficionado and have eaten them in all fifty states except for alaska and maine yes i have eaten wings numerous times in hawaii and i would have to say that these were some of the worst i really have nothing else to say but yuck   we will definitely not be back to this placepharmacy is soooo very rude they put your medications on auto refill whether you want it or not three months later i am still getting early morning wakeup calls to get my prescription that i dont have any longer  even after 4 phone calls after 4 calls they tell me that cant do anything about the auto phone calls they tell me to call their 800  do you believe that  that can request the phone calls to start but not to stop  reallystaff  incredibly rude the day we went it seemed the lady taking our order was getting into it with the cook  she wasnt all that interested in taking anyones order  she was rude  unfriendly very crass in her tone as well    wait time  yeah i understand they cook your burger while you wait it seemed that on a pretty busy night they didnt have proper staff  food  the food was good burger quite greasy if thats for you then youll enjoy  me not so much  building  at times while we were sitting down eating we smelled something that smelled similar to propane gas fumes it was enough to give us a headache  make us a little nauseous so we kept opening the door hoping that the smell would escape  that my friends makes it a bit difficult to really enjoy your dinner   overall i was disappointed i had been told that their fries were awesome highly disappointed i was  the fact that the service sucked has pretty much turned me away from visiting 500 degrees againim a coffee roaster im a coffee guy im a barista im a decent guy and i thought this place served super shitty coffee the service was terrible except for one guy there who made my drink he was friendly and attentive the cashier an attractive european woman was super unfriendly and could care less about anything but herself the coffee is burnt meaning roasted way too dark it was oily and i took seriously only two sips and had to throw it out i come from an east coast and west coast coffee background and i thought for all the hype this place had the worst coffee i have ever had straight up the design was old school beautiful but i was disappointed after all the talk about la colombe they have potential but not with that coffee and serviceordered a pizza and was told 2535 minutes hour and a half later and after calling 3 times they finally said it is coming out of the oven now so i promptly called the 2 rude employees and canceled and asked for a refund thats horrible service jimmy johns for dinner tonightoften many products not in stock 1 star many times the line at check out is over five people with only two lines open 2 stars meat always is marked as expiring that day or the next  fruit often is borderline rotten 3 stars finally prices are high  4 starswaitress was the only nice thing at this visit it took forever to get our food 730 pm friday night and very few people then husband got a moldy bun on his burger   i now understand why there were very few people here on a friday evening we loved pennys but will not be back herethis restaurant is beautiful inside and out but the food isnt that good and its expensive zero options for vegetarians and vegans the only choice i had was a caesar salad the depot is also in the worst part of reno by the bus station downtown many many transients prostitutes meth etc im glad they restored the building but the location is horribleworst customer service of anywhere ive ever been everyone is miserable borderline depressed the only good thing about this place is their fresh deli meatthe lady forgot to write vanilla on my latte i left the store and when i got into my car and started driving i realized it was wrong so i stopped at the starbucks on 4th and south

horrid  service tues 102814 550  ben and i walk into red robin kind of excited since neither of us have been to this location one couple is in front of us at the hostess stand but there are only 34 tables of people in the restaurant we are seated relatively quickly   555 will the waiter comes over and gets our drink order ben asks for a tnt long island and i order a mojito we also put in an order for the chiliconqueso  600 we see that the couple who arrived at the same time as us are now getting their drinks we start looking around for ourswill seems to have disappeared  605 drinks arrive bens tnt looks great but says it tastes like there is no alcohol in it mine looks a little cloudly and tastes like pure lime juice the waiter happens to be taking orders for the table right next to us family of 4 2 kids uder the age of 6 adorable so i flag him down and let him know whats wrong he apologizes and says he will fix it takes the drink and heads to the bar we can see him talking to the bar tender she doesnt look offended yay  app arrives fantastic queso we both were very impressed with the quality i highly recommend the queso  610 2nd mojito arrives will asks me to taste it before he leaves nice gesture now the drink tastes like soda water still cant taste the mint or the rum or tastesee any sugar in the glass really sent the drink back again dinner orders are placed 2 tavern doubles my toppings on the side ben asks for cheese and bacon only with a side of honey mustard  615 a 2nd waitress comes to the table and asks if i would like to order anything else in place of the failed mojito i ask for a sweet tea disappointment abounds  616sweet tea magically appears at the table kids at the table next door settle down their food has arrived    617  we start playing a round of trivial pursuit on the bottle of heinz ketchup ben and i are kicking ass and taking names 625 we have finished 3 full games of trivial pursuit boredom is setting in where is the waiter where is our food  630 finally salvation in the form of a burger smells great we tell the food runner that we asked for honey mustard she says she will be right back our waiter is still mia  635 this burger is awesome i totally understand why people like this place ben is done with his fries no honey mustard yet the couple who came in at the same time as us seem to have left already  637 honey mustard finally i use bens leftovers on my fries yummy  640 bens kinda itching for more fries waiter still hasnt even come over to ask how the food is well was ben and i wonder when the waiter will be back hes still mia family of 4 has their check and is packing up to leave already  643 well hey there mr waiter did you get lost no glad to hear it we order another round of fries he said itll be about 5 mins i ask for the check and tell the waiter i have a coupon he writes down my member number and disappears  650 waiter stops by with an arm full of food ill be back in a second the code

new waiter never seen him before appologizes profusely takes my code again i make a comment about how we have been here for over an hour and we are trying to make a movie in 30 mins answer sorry its really busy tonight  711 waiter drops the check off arm full of food again i ask him to come back after he drops that off no reason to cause other people to wait as long as we did  712 yes he came right back i was shocked too i explained to will the reason that he was not getting a very nice tip from us i felt like he poorly managed his time and resources i explained that there were 5 tables when we first walked in and yet it took us over a hour to receive drinks an app and a meal for 2 i also pointed out that he took over 20 minutes to deliver the check to me after i asked for it i made a point of telling him that we had arrived so early because we were trying to make a movie and were still disappointed in the timeliness of the service wills response was you should have told me you were trying to make a movie i could have put a rush order on it let me just say whether or not i am trying to make a movie is irrelevent my service should not be that slow ever  somebody please send a corporate trainer to this location hire a bartender who can make drinks hire waiters who have the ability to handle 6 tables on a tuesday night the food was great i would love to go back but we will not be returning because of the service disappointedgrade d  i have wanted to try this place for a while so this morning we went for a southern breakfast the empty dirty parking lot and poorly maintained exterior should have been a warning to move on  however being in the mood for homemade biscuits we went in to this little diner hoping for the best sadly it was one of the worse breakfasts ive ever had i had the traditional eggs grits bacon and a biscuit while my bf had french toast the french toast was two small pieces of stale store bought bread  the eggs were fried too much on the outside while still having that gross runny white inside the iced tea had a weird flavor maybe instant the biscuit was dense and hard then slathered in fake greasy liquid butter the gravy had another weird flavor i couldnt place finally the bacon was so bad cold cheap and chewy we would only use it in a fish trap  i would not recommend this place to anyone nor will we ever returnthe food is not as advertised small portions and tasteless i know lisa c said the owners are amazing  the only thing i found amazing was how poorly they treat their customers that were not happy with their product avoid at all costwent through the drivethru here on the way to the airport because i remover it being greatwell now it has terrible service it was slow the ladies at the window were a bunch of smart assesi cant believe it my breakfast egg and cheese biscuit was slapped together so fast it wasnt even together the coffee was at least drinkable i came here years ago and it was great today it was horrible i will not be coming here any time i visit the area anymore dont waste your time and money go to starbucks or dunkin donuts down the streetand forgot  we went to the pool and couldnt get a towel without finding a managerthe worst ever they think your are a tourist and inflate your bill manager did nothing i never got what i ordered horrible service i went to the manager three times with complaints she should have taken over our table or watched over it the first thing that happened was the waiter brought the drinks out and never poured the wine we had to continue to serve ourselves i when to the manager because it had been over an hour since we ordered note place was 13 full it took over an hour to get our food and i didnt get what i ordered she offered to get it but who wants it after another 12 wait she said she would comp dessert i ask for a reduction in price and she still just wanted to comp dessert the night before i had spent 321 there and had a great time i told her that and her response was less then satisfactory we had two tables and we were ready to leave i saw my son staring at his bill 150 for a couple drinks and dinner that when i had to get her again poor customer handling skills patrick thanks for the night before but that manager doesnt have good customer skills she lost a repeat customerlooked like a great place to get a smoothie came by after a workout at the gym at 720 i saw one of the employees on the phone talking and another mopping the floor i pulled on the door twice to open and it was locked neither one of them looked my direction as im assuming they were ready to go home for the night such a shame first time visiting this establishment and they dont stay open until the posted closing time great first impression i wont be backsloooooooooowwwwwwww 730 on a saturday only 3 groups of folks in the whole place and it still took about 30 minutes to get our foodmy  husband and i came here for lunch two weeks ago and the service was horrible the bus boy was more receptive to our needs as customers than anyone else so the manager gave us a credit  for the amount we spent for the day so we thought wed try to come back again today and use use up the the credit that was given to us from the initial visit they told us it would be about 2025 min for the two medium pizzas we we return for our pizzas we find that only 1 pizza is ready and the other pizza  the cheese has been used for the lunch pizza bar and the wait will be another 15 or so minutes if we decide to wait management is absolutely ridiculous at this restaurant and the lunch bar is sloppy and unkept horrible servicewe placed our first order from wang cai this evening  with the exception of the very nice delivery guy it was the worst experience i have had in a very long time  all of the food was hard as a rock and tasted terrible  i called the store i cannot call this place a restaurant and calmly explained my concerns with the food  i was told its the same as always  i explained that i dont know about always because this was my first order  i was then told that when i order next time i should come in instead of getting delivery so that i could check my order first  i explained that if this is the way the first always is i would not be ordering again  okay was the answer  my husband then took the food up there to show them what the problem was and see if they would offer a resolution  the guy opens the container sticks his hands in it and breaks open a piece of chicken and looks at my husband as if to say whats wrong with it  we will not be doing any further business with wang cai and we will never recommend this place to anyone  pathetic disgusting  horribleworst server experience i have ever had when youve been doing this for forty years and still havent mastered the most basic steps of service then perhaps it is time to move on our server took our order brought it to our table and did not come back one single time the entire time we sat she never asked if we liked our food never offered drink refills nothing 20 minutes after we had finished our meal i finally got impatient and asked the hostess if she could please find our server so we could get our check that is when the fun began  when she finally came with our check which again was the first time we had seen her in the hour since she had served us our food i very politely asked her if she could please see about having the french toast i ordered taken off the bill it was awful  everything else was great and we were very happy with the food overall but the french toast was inedible she asked me why i didnt like it and before i could answer she started getting angry that i hadnt let her know sooner that i was unhappy with it  i told her it was because i hadnt seen her since she served us our food asked her why she never once came to see how we were doing  her response was that it was a small restaurant and i should have come to find her  what she then held our check up over our heads and ripped it to shreds  then she continued to stand above me and reiterate over and over again in 10 different ways that this was my fault for not tracking her down and was angrily insisting that she had been doing this for 40 years and had done a great job  she was literally ripping me a new one in front of my kids and the entire dining room and not one employee who was standing there watching this stepped in to do anything about it  by this time my teenage son and his girlfriend had walked out of the restaurant because she had absolutely humiliated them and my seven year old daughter who was scared to death ran out behind them crying hysterically  i went out after them calmed everyone down and made an attempt to turn it into a life lesson for them  i told them when something like this happens the right thing to do is to call the owner and let them know that they have an employee who is hurting their business  i told them that most business owners care a lot about their customers and would appreciate knowing that one of their employees had not only behaved this way but had ripped up a check out of anger which should have been money in the owners pocket  heres where it gets really juicy  i went home and googled the owners name because i was hoping to find a way maybe through social media to contact her directly since i wasnt confident that a message left at the restaurant would ever get to her the first result that caught my eye was an article which had been written about the restaurant which included a photo of the owner  a photo of the same woman who had been standing behind the counter doing paperwork 10 feet away from our table the entire time  the same woman who watched the situation unfold start to finish and did absolutely nothing about it  needless to say the life lesson learned by my kids today ended up being drastically different than the one i had originally intendedno wait app said 2540 minutes noticed no food on any tables  asked why not seated after an hour baileys was allowing the kitchen to catch up left  went to laylas   best decision ever had a way better burger at laylas go to laylas   baileys is a disaster  got a text from baileys that table was ready after 90 minutes hathis has got to be the worst pharmacy in philadelphia the amount of pharmacy techs almost always outnumbers the amount of people in line for prescriptions yet somehow they are all too busy to acknowledge the people in line or worse actually help us every single time i go here and i go to the pharmacy at least twice a monthi have to stare down someone for a few minutes before one of them tells another one to help me dont even bother to ask them to hold a prescription for you because they will ignore you the pharmacy techs here do not give a shit about you or doing their job efficiently i have had so many issues with this incompetent staff that i cant recommend this pharmacy to anyonedoor locked today sign says under new managment grand reopening 092412  will have to review again after it reopensi will preface this with a comment about how we did have a larger party and i understand that serving a party is no easy task but  this was by far the worst service i have ever encountered we sat down and waited a full 30 mins before our server even took a drink order then we waited another 40 mins to order over an hour to just order when we spoke to the manager about the wait he just responded with  i will see what i can do see what you can do how about grabbing a note pad and taking our order it was not that busy and our lunch took about 3 hours from start to finish my husband and i love to take brew tours across areas and we were excited to visit here but based on the attitude of the service in general we will never be back here   ps the food was meh and the beers were nothing spectacular brugge is way better and much nicer peoplei bought the groupon to try their meats just to change things up from fresh market  well i should have went to look at the place before i bought the groupon  the place was warm unkept messy and made me wonder how long the items in the cases had been sitting there i purchased the stuffed chicken breasts ground beef a prepared meatloaf and lazagna i saw one clerk scooping seafood up with his bare hands into a bag  yuck  the instructions for cooking the chicken were not all there  i had to guess as to what it said  needless to say the chicken was terrible  the ground beef i made into patties  when i cooked them on the grill they dripped slimmy stuff and looked gross  i wish i had put more seasoning on them cause there were tasteless  overall i should have taken the 20 i spent on the groupon for this place and invested it at the fresh market where i usually gonever again i can get the same burger at wendys i didnt realize this place was just a fast food joint  i thought it would be better guess i should have know better since its a chain i gave up fast food a long time ago beware the regular hamburgers are double parties they fail to tell you this when you order the little burgers are singles youd think they would post this information on the giant menu above the counter where you order if they would use some better quality cheese like cheddar instead of american it would probably be a lot less fast food tasting the french fries are ok but i prefer the salted over the seasoned the seasoned have way too much seasoning the peanuts are a nice little extra not really necessary since i will be shoving lots of fat in my mouth after i eat peanuts but i guess its a nice gesture to give out free peanuts i probably wont go back since i can get a way better burger and several different places closer to my house uptownthe pennsylvania ave downingtown wawa is without a doubt the dirtiest wawa that i have ever been to from the smeared front windows to disgusting coffee station that has trash and spillage overflowing to multiple coffee decanters being empty the place is just filthy the area where the tastykakes are had 6 empty boxes on the shelves register checkout is the slowest of all wawas that i have been to where is managementso we are lucky the we have had a few but one gets free blizzard actually very cool but the last time we came to this store we ordered a royal blizzard but got a reg so me working in customer service thought the manager should know when we told him his response wasnt sorry we will do better next time nor just sorry that happen to you no what we got was well you got a coupon for buy one get one free shame on him to assume we were trying to get one free  we already were just wanted him to know since he ran the place thank for the ice cream is goodi only gave 1 star because i had to do that to leave a review charging for parking at a casino where one never wins is terrible dont they make enough profit with the lowest payout in the state its not like they are crunched for real estate or people park there to enjoy other options like the french qtr in new orleans or the strip in vegas  its just greediness to the tenth power or worse  we went to enjoy lunch with my motherinlaw but to get free parking she could not even use her player comps we had to spend 50 in cash or by credit card just more greed on top of greed i hope they collapse and crumble their empire of greedthe overpriced and inflexible menu put me off right away i wanted a 2 piece fried chicken meal it came in two versions  dark meat 1 leg 1 thigh and white meat 1 breast 1 wing i dont eat dark meat or wings i asked if i could have a two piece meal with two breasts and said i would pay extra if i had to i explained that i dont eat wings and didnt want to throw away half my meal or pay for something i wasnt going to eat the woman at the counter said oh we cant do that when i asked why she got the manager who also just said we cant do that i left without buying anything way to make a customer happy big q i will not be backtried calling half a dozen times around noon today with no answer call went directly to answering machine needless to say i tried then went to buudys deal to purchase 50 coupon and they were locked up bad day for piezanos and a good day for oreganos sorryridiculous that most of the things on the menu they are out of went through the drive through and glad i dont live close because i wouldnt returnhorrible set up with only one person of 6 making tea walked out without tea after 15 min wait and barista who complained incessantly that he had lots of orders are all the locations this bad set up geared to selling gadgets and no serving tea loversafter getting yelps weekly email i was looking forward to trying the pie unfortunately this place didnt deliver the lighting was creepy kind of drs office meets drug store the apple pie looked delicious see photos but it was disgusting apples were crisp with no gooeyness in the filling and a strong overall chalky taste something went wrong im sad i wasted 10 on such a gross piece of pie dont be fooled by the photothis place is lamei found their donuts to be dry and stale when i visited  would not go back nor recommend to anyone  the concept was interesting and would have been good if their base donut recipe was good  an additional negative for me was the lack of seating  they do not offer any seating so when i met some friends there on a cold winter morning for donuts we had to sit outside in the cold benches nearby or in our carswe have been to casinos all over the us now and never have we had such a horrible experience right off the bat i understand they worry about making their money but when youre only up 600 and they start switching the dealer 3 times and all the shoes  plus any table you go to after that  that is ridiculous  ive never felt more paranoid for just having a good time  we went to 5 different tables with different games and deck amounts and each time they followed usdisgruntled staff working alone with no oversight i ordered a bagel he took my payment at the cash register  when i ordered and proceeded to make my order with out washing his hands while also coughing and sniffling with a runny nose needless to say i decided to just walk out as it both disgusting and not worth getting sick to get my bagel tried calling to speak with a manager to get a refund of my 705 but no manager or alternate staff is available not sanitarydisgusting disorganized filthy and much more crap to addslow declining food quality the last two times i have ordered it has taken at least an hour to get my sandwich the last time i ordered after 50 minutes the driver called me and said he was at our office 15 minutes later he still wasnt there when he did arrive there was confusion with the order   two orders ago  my chips were stale this last order there was one small piece of bacon on the club lulu and the turkey had an odd taste   after two years of ordering almost weekly i am moving on the speed and quality of the food have declined significantly and there are now better options availablebeing a fan of all that is breakfast i had to recruit my girl and head to the much talked about pancake pantrypp   45 minutes in line later you dont wait in line at the waffle house  you might already know where im going with this we find ourselves being quickly ushered across the restaurant floor to be squeezed at a table nuzzled a sparse 6 inches from our neighbors on both sides hello new unwanted friendsat waffle house you can have your own booth and enjoy the company you intended to enjoy  at this point im thinking they must bring grand portions of the most divine breakfast culinary treats and feed it to you while an attendant under the table cleans your feet with a warm towel and then gently massages away until your feet are happy and relaxed reality comes crashing in as i realize there is only room enough for my legs under the table and the menu consists of your stereotypical breakfast fare with astronomical prices tagged on12 dollars will stuff two people at the waffle house  a brief synopsis sausage  looks fresh from a microwave hash browns  large cut and flavorless eggs  mcdonalds does it better pancakes  id rather make them myself mushrooms  from a canseriously ick  i wasnt really sure what i was paying for here it wasnt the ambience perhaps i was paying for sidewalk space while i waited for overhyped poorly prepared overpriced cafeteria food  i thought of giving the  pp two stars for serving breakfast in a town with a shortage of breakfast joints but then i once again remembered that you could walk into a waffle house and not wait know what to expect get decent service not get packed in like cattle and have food that competes with the pp for a third of the price  perhaps im a little grumpy in the morningit seems as though something has gone wrong at this wendys  it used to be a reliable option for a quick weekday drivethrough lunch  over the last six weeks however there has been something amiss every time i have visited  interminable wait times menu items unavailable items missing or the wrong items in my order confused order takers seriously interminable wait timesyou get the idea  its no longer reliable so i am going to take a break from this one for a time  no rudeness thankfully so i will be back  but i do hope they get it togethershould be zero stars  very poor experience on 61116  we waited about 20 minutes just to place our order from a parking spot via the call button  the employees clearly saw us since one girl gave us a nasty look and another employee served a car next to us  at 1145ish pm the lights were turned off the ones covering the picnic tables and parking spots where we weresending a pretty strong message the employees were not wanting to serve anymore despite the restaurant having another 15 minutes of being open    if these sonic employees at this location prepare food as carelessly as they treat customers im glad i didnt eat herethe service still sucks and employee courtesy went down the toilet i say this because i went through the drive thru to get an ice cream cone to share with my dog the cashier said it wasnt available   so i get to the window to pay for my soda and in the most ignorant and sarcastic of tones she says were cleaning out the machine so the notice through the intercom was fine dont need to be a dick at the first windowgross the pizza was swimming in grease and the cheese wasnt fully cooked just disgustinggarbage anytime you go through the drive through and then have to circle back around because your food is cold never go back  for starters the person at the drive through wasnt even polite either just asked for the order and gave the total no welcome to wendys what can we get you or anything else just go ahead and the total before i was even finished with my order didnt even ask what sauce for the nuggets just assumed bbq so i had to ask at the window when they handed me the bag of cold burgers skimpy fries and nuggets  regardless of the person in the drive through having to go in after going through the drive through and have 5 burgers remade due to them being cold was a huge disappointment and there wasnt even an offer for an extra fry  or maybe a frosty for my trouble people go through drive through for a reason to not have to come inside major inconvenience and they acted like i was inconveniencing them love wendys but this one is junkgo to a different one and stay clear of this onei went into this starbucks on a sunday last week and heard rap music which isnt good music to listen to when i was coming in to enjoy coffee and work on my laptop shift manager was some female with the name tag nic not a very good representative of the starbucks atmosphere you want will let all my friends know to stay away from this starbucks hope they change the shift managers if they want to keep customers coming backi cant speak for the frozen yogurt because the three times ive tried to go the store has been closed despite it being an hour plus before the posted closing time its frustrating because its really the only frozen yogurt place in the area so it would be helpful to have the correct operating hours or at least update them if theyve been changedsat in the drive thru for over ten minutes as the only customer  i never got my order taken even though i tried to get the attention of the drive thru worker  i ended up just leavinglong wait times and terrible service gave them chance after chance to impress us they failed every timetoo many employees and they dont know what theyre doing i ordered chicken tenders with honey mustard they gave me a cut up chicken breast with packs of actual honey not worth it for 8 probably wont be backstopped for a meal first and last visit huge cockroach crawled out from under our table as we were eating kept thinking where it had been and what it had been walking on and dining earlierthe sandwiches they sell are good but when you find hair in the food after waiting an hour for delivery  horrible  they need to work on cleanliness and speed thank you for readingmy wife and i decided to try it out and probably will not be going again the server monique was extremley rude my wife ordered boneless wings with extra buffalo sauce manager brings out our food and my wife gets bonein wings she tells the manager that she ordered the bonless wings not bonein we know mistakes happen no big deal our server turns around and glares at us when we got done with our meal we get the check on the check is bonein wings my wife lets the server know so she can adjust the check the server then tells her in a very rude tone oh its because you changed the order in front of the manager my wife tells her that she never ordered bonein wings and the server is practically arguing with us on what we ordered that behavior and attitude doesnt belong in customer servicethe service is soooooooooooooooooooooooo slow and there will be terrible songs singing when you eating 2 orders of dry ribs brought them out 2 times and they was the same way the waiter was very nice thoughwe had a large group come to moonshine on 11114 and it was one of the worst experiences we ever had  first they told us earlier that day that the cover charge was 5 and we could not reserve tables and when we got there they decided the cover was 7 because they had two bands and there were reserve signs on tables for other people when we went in wth  and the music was not bluesit was hillbilly music  ordering food upstairs in the bbq was a joke too  they told everyone that it would be 1015 min and it was well over an hour for mostand then it was cold food  everytime you would go up to see if your order was ready they always said 10 minutes  it was crazy  the place is so mismanaged and run by a bunch of kids  the workers in moonshine were very rude and the ones upstairs in the bbq were so unorganized it was pathetic  there was a guy in the bbq complaining to the manager about the service and the manager looked like she was about 25 yrs old  we had people in our group leave after a short time because they were hungry and they werent getting their food and just got their money back and left to find someplace to eat we will never be back to this place  horriblei was pretty disappointed tried a few sandwiches and grilled panini that were definitely premade overly greasy and the bread was a little tough also had side salads that were underwhelming with not so good dressings they do have mighty leaf tea bags which was very nice to have would like to see the sandwich quality improve other than that not sure how the rest of the menu stacks upnot only did they need us to repeat our order 3 times at the drive thru but they got our order wrong to add insult to injury they thought i bet this couple would love burned food to start their day as they drive to work sure we should have checked prior to leaving but heaven forbid we expect them to get our order right i mean its not like i expect michelin star quality just the right premade food to be grabbed from the rack congratulations you fail at literally picking up the right thing and taking it out of the toaster before it turns black a task most kindergarten children can succeed at not coming back which sucks for them because i am a dunkin addictthe food here is yummy and it is clean but today i had the worst experience but it wasnt the first time i have  right away it took forever for someone to help me and i was the only person standing there  second right away i ordered my usual bruito bowl with extra rice the girl puts less rice then you typically would receive if you didnt ask for extra the second i realized i said can you please add more rice sorry  she looks at me annoyed and says sure only to turn to the girl next to her and complain about me right in front of me about wanting more rice then she proceeds to give me so little half and half chicken  steak that i couldnt even tell i was eating any meat    after finally getting everything made i had to stand there forever while people just kept walking by just to pay i honestly was about to tell them i didnt even want it anymore i can honestly say this was definitely not with the 8 something i paidthis mcdonalds is always slow and very poorly run please hire better management for this locationdo not get the crawfish they are so freaking spicy its not even pleasurable i was born and raised here in a little spicy crawfish this is spiciest ive ever had in my life trust me ive had it all this is borderline torture not enjoyable whatsoever spicier than a big spoonful of wasabithis particular location is terrible theyve gotten my order wrong more than once and they take way to long in the drive thru today i waited for about 3 minutes without a greeting from the whoever was supposed to use the intercom then i was stuck in the line without an order because i couldnt back out of there ive tried them several times and nothing changes poor service  i will not returnlocation location location is what they have going for them  the rest was underwhelming  the space and bathroom were rather dirty and the beer was unimpressivewhat a sorry place this is for service its my local dd i prefer the lattes here to the ones served at starbucks but when did  the customer is always right especially when they are being incredibly polite about their issue become a thing of the pastnot sure what was going on  when they opened none of the cupcakes were set out   most were frozen in the ice cream case   i thought the cupcakes were fresh not frozen  chairs not set up and the place looked in total disarray   new ownership maybe   new manager  whatever the reason was i was very disappointed  the cupcake i got one of the few unfrozen ones was pretty flavorless  the one i really wanted was a key lime but they were some of the frozen ones   hard to eat a rockhard cupcakenothing to review  we were a party of 6 who walked in on mothers day for drinks and dinner  there were quite a few empty tables  we stood by the hostess stand for a while  a couple of waitresses walked by us and said nothing  the bartender stood there looking at us but not speaking  no one said anything like feel free to seat yourself or please wait someone will seat you shortly  we just stood there for 1015 minutes and leftwe have been to in riva several times and genuinely enjoy the food and vibe yet their service is wellbelow par last night my party of five was seated approximately 45 minutes after our confirmed reservation time ordinarily i would not bother to write a comment but their approach bothered me after calling the day before to confirm my reservation and repeat my preference to sit outside i thought we would be ok unfortunately as soon as we arrived we were treated as if there was no reservation or request after being told repeatedly that the table would be ready in minutes the hostess never delivered on her word we ended up having a good meal and a nice evening but there is no excuse for failing to honor your commitment to your customers weak saucesometimes when i read bad reviews on yelp i assume the person is a crappy customer i almost always think that person was probably just being an ass i wish so badly that bareburger hadnt disappointed me over and over and over and over you get the point  the biggest problem orders for pickup and delivery are always wrong this is not an exaggeration on more than 6 occasions consecutively they have either given wrong orders or food has been completely missing on other occasions theyll call and tell us they are out of something offer to sub it then the order is still wrong my boyfriend and i have more than once made bets that go like this how long before they call and tell us theyre out of insert desired order or whats the overunder on our sides being missing weve complained politely weve given them chance after chance because we love the food but we cant anymore their promises that it wont happen again and their offers to reimburse arent worth the frustration of half a meal being missing or wrong tonights missing slaw was the last slaw straw  other problems business hours seems to be a loose term they will stop seating stop serving or down right be closed before their posted hours i have no idea how to determine the rhyme or reason for this this type of willynilly schedule must be a luxuryi wonder if theyre hiring service is questionable i understand working in food service ive been there and ill be the first to admit that people are the worst some people take to the internet to rant about food but faking enthusiasm is a must if you are truly miserable and work at a restaurant the people working at bareburger are somehow able to make you feel like you have kicked a puppy in front of children when all you did was ask a friendly question the dmv would be proud  the food is greatwhen it shows up sadly ive missed out on tasting most of it i wont be trying againive been trying to get in this place since it opened weeks ago but the line was always too long this time the lines were non existent after sampling 7 different items on the menu i can see why in a nutshell the food is terrible the pulled pork sandwich was dry as the sahara potato wedges were bland tasteless and soggy  not to mention the larger ones were undercooked  the mashed potatoes were like trying to eat a container of white playdoh how about the fries  listen if you cant make french fries crispy then stop making them maybe salt on them would help but probably not the mac and cheese had zero flavor and the texture made me think it was microwaved mac and cheese from the dollar store sitting on your countertop for a few hours the fried chicken breading flavor wasnt terrible but it was wet and soggy thats a no no its fried chicken for gods sake crispy please  lastly the  biscuits what can i say dry and tasteless did i say dry i did big disappointment one star is too much for this joint i give the place 6 months   update  i was wrong  they lasted 9 months  hopefully a 5 guys leases this joint my wife and i have gone here twice now for cake  you can get a nice moist fresh cake at the supermarket but you cant get one at this bakery  we wont be wasting our time nor money on old dry and well overprice cake  if we could give this place a zero or negative we wouldwent this past saturday afternoon and i will say with all the restaurants in the ares this place will not last since they cannot even meet the minimum standards for service and quality  my wife and i ordered a cheeseburger with all the veggies on the side an order of fries an order of onion rings a shake and a soda my wife and i were sharing a burger and she does not like veggies and i do  the shake and the soda came out right away  the burger took over 40 minutes  yes 40 minutes for a burger fries and onion rings  when it did come out it had veggies on it the rings and fries came out before the burger the rings were cold  they went and fixed our burger but we think they did not remake our burger just scraped off the veggies and my wife said she could still taste pickles on the burger  the waiter also stated that they cook all burgers to medium  well ours was well done  it also was not very busy in there so not sure how it takes 40 minutes for a burger  i would not recommend this place  as a matter of fact while i was in our hotel elevator someone said the food at our hotel was bad which was true so i told them if they want good food and service do not go to bareburger  i did recommed bud and marylins and locust rondevous to the couple in the elevator  see my reviews for those establishments  the only positive for bareburger is they offered to make us another burger no charge and took that burger off our check  we did not want another burger because we did not want to wait another 40 minutes  if we are in philly again we would never go hereit was about 20 min to closing and i stopped by to grab a coffee  and cookie  as i asked for the cookie the guy on shift told me that they where all out so i asked what else they had he said all the food was sold for the day and there wasnt anymore left unfortunately i looked over and saw plenty of stuff horrible servicei work 3rd shift and get off at 2am and there is very few places that are 24hrs twice in two nights i was denied a burger they said the grills are down then i asked for milkshake they said milkshake machine is down then on a 3rd occasion i was served food but after i didnt get a response in drive thru i drove around and they were all outside smoking  im done with this place people dont wanna work apparently at this time of night they shouldnt be open 24hrs to waste peoples timei dont think my order has ever been right on the first time before live nearby so i go there but its so frustrating wish theyd work on things also ice cream machine is broken a lot ketchup station is always messy this place needs new management or owner or something just needs helphave eaten there several times in the past and the food and service was good today we went for breakfast and we seated ourselves informed the the young lady at the register we were outside and she basically nodded waited some time and no service my wife then when in and let them know we were outside and the waitress acknowledged her waited around 15 minutes still no service we then went elsewhere for breakfast they were not that busy so no excuse not sure if we will return againfirst off my husband went through the drive through and he was told the wait would be 5 mins even though it was late at night and not a single person in line when my husband asks 5 mins to see if he heard right the guy got really rude and abrasive with him when the guys finally came back they were out of everything and again the guy was very rude in the process of telling him he ended up leaving   the other day again he went in and saw the guy who was very rude to him and apparently he must be the manager or something which is a shame he ordered a half dozen donuts and every one of them was stale i mean stale they would have been better to throw out than the eat for the amount of calories they were so basically we will probably never order from here againhorrible customer service we came in and waited 15 min to place a togo order not once did we get asked if weve been helped or if we needed anything got up to leave cause we didnt get serviced and the lady just said oh well  i have no idea how this place has such high ratingsthe food better be good because the iced coffee is horrible and the service is deplorable party of 3 sat at the counter when it wasnt overly busy waited about 10 minutes for beverages and then another 15 just to order now we have been waiting for over 30 minutes for our food meanwhile friends of a server popped in had drinks in immediately and magically their food do yourself a favor and go anywhere elsethis place doesnt even deserve one star the icing on the cake of my horrible experience was getting served cold lasagna it had definitely been sitting out for some time and not under any heat the waitress was slow and rude the only good part of my meal was the salad because it actually came out quickly and isnt meant to be warm manager was polite and attempted to apologize but at that point i just wanted to leave this place left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than oneice cream is always a weakness for me  homemade ice cream is kryptonite  therefore every time we passed this place closed on our way home from dinner in royersford i cursed the fact that wed stayed too long at french quarter bistro making us miss a chance for nelsons on the way home  little did i know that french quarter bistros desserts are a million times better than nelsons and are a much better value for your money too  from nelsons website  while there are other ice cream companies associated with the city of philadelphia there are no other companies that still make their own ice cream from scratch onsite  nelsons homemade ice cream does not taste like any homemade ice cream i have ever had  here is a list of chain stores who make ice cream better than nelsons  handels berwyn cold stone brewsters and so on  nelsons did not taste fresh or creamy or anything like the homemade stuff ive had anywhere else  frankly it tasted like econo grocery store brand ice cream  turkey hill is better  ben and jerrys is better and those have sat on the shelf how long  the prices were ridiculous  i was surprised that in royersford where prices are normally lower in comparison to the mainline where we incur our cost of living nelsons prices were comparable if not higher than similar places near us  for the quality it was ridiculous  now that ive tasted it i would not take it for free  i would be nicer in my review meaning i would be a little less judgmental not meaning i would change how i feel about the yucky ice cream if it had not been for the staff at nelsons  its important to note that nelsons is cash only which i find particularly obnoxious considering their prices are on par with places who serve far better quality product cheaper and take credit cards  nelsons doesnt have this cash only policy posted anywhere and yet they seem to take it for granted that people should understand this  they are shocked to find out you dont have cash on you and look at you like youre a moron when you go to pay with a credit card like everyone else in the 21st century  thanks nelsons for the snotty attitude  no thanks for your ice creamshe saidjust like all the other reviews one star i would not recommend this place to anyone nor would i go back there my club came out on a burnt  english muffin with about 2 slices of turkey dry cheese soggy tomatoes and dry lettuce sorry but it just wasnt good my husbands pastrimi sandwich came out the same way on a little english muffinnothing like the pictures on the menus yeahwont be going back here  he saidyuck i hate eating somewhere and not being satified this place did this to me we ordered lunch and their sandwiches looked legit but what we got looked like little dried up breakfast muffins that were overcooked in a microwave id rather of ate at a waffle house than here anytimethe tacos were highly disappointing  the flavor mix was not unique but rather just plain bad  and then an hour later i got sick as hell from these things  go somewhere else anywhere elsewhile the location is convenient and near the casinos this is absolutely the worst mcdonald i have been  not only is this location old and run down it is also dirty and understaffed   i cant believe i had to be in line for more than 15 minutes before i can place my order and i had to wait for another 10 for my order  come on it is only a large soda with a mcchicken  well unwrapping my food was a story of its own   i have never seen a sloppy mcchicken with lettuce all over  the picture does not do its justice because half of the lettuce already fell on me and the floor when i tried to unwrap  this mcdonald definitely needs better managementcant stand their coffee  it tastes like it was strained through an old sock  ill stick to tim hortonsi wanna continue to support small businesses i really do and i already do support my fair share but the quality must improve  i will say that the food wasnt bad mac wasnt the best ive ever had average tops collards were cold but delicious grilled cornbread and the hostess was very apologetic ive ordered from this place a few times and loved it even sent friends  however  at your eateryrestaurant i should not  have to wait for almost two hours for food after waiting a half hour to be seated and another 20 mins to have someone come wait on you after pulling any available server working the floor no reason at all to have that much of a wait time without being told from the beginning no matter how busy you are or it being a holiday be honest up front about your wait times so that people can choose whether or not they want to stay  see roaches or any other types of insectsrodents  roach fell out of takeout container  servers who cant handle more than one table at a time or behave as i have to give you my  i dont care how good your foodproduct is it doesnt compensate for quality customer service one server was able to work four tables at one time making sure everyone was taken care of and even accommodated us when our server was often no where to be found or ignoring us i usually dont tip anything less than 20 wherever i go and though i gave her a tip this is the first time in a long time that ive ever felt in a position to give anyone such a low tip smh hire competent staff who want to serve  if any of these offenses happen be courteous enough to earn your customer back with a complementary meal or comp card it doesnt have to be for much maybe half the meal or 25 towards a meal   20 is not enough to compensate for all of the above it only came to about 79 off of the meal let me point out i dont mind paying for my food those were large portions and though i didnt expect a free meal a little more could have been taken off of that bill  the staff outside of our server were pretty apologetic but in all honesty they must do better  not sure if ill be back and its a shame because i want to see them improvenice looking location unfortunately they have only been open less than a month and ive already gotten snotty attitude ridden service not something you want to deal with early in the morning i miss the staff from the one recently closed down the road alreadygrabbed some pizza here once it sucked the people seemed nice the booze seems to be the main focus and the selection of it was huge   so 1 star cause the pizza made my gf nauseous but if you want decent cheap booze check it out and if you have a crazy craving for funnel cake you can get a fix herei was expecting great things after all i have heard about it how ever i was truly disappointed ordered the stlouis rib lunch quarter slab and three sides i chose maccheese corn casserole and greens the food came out semi on time they measure there 14 slabs different than i do a small 14 and three extremely small sides non being hot at all one of my big pet peves corn caaserole was dry and flavourless macchesse made with rigatoni noodles extremely boring and greens were equally with out flavor in fact not sure why i gave it one star may be because the building was fairly unique oh ya ribs were not hot either and non descript rubchaos food barely warm cooks cannot keep up this place needs competent cooks never coming backhave been 2 times the first time i went thought the food was good decent bbq spot in stc second time however bbq was less flavorful and the sides were disappointing  also was disappointed with the service they messed up my sides initially which mistakes happen but then they never fixed it and werent planning to it seems hard to want to come back for inconsistent bbqterrible service waited 2 hours after we sat down just for the food our waitress forgot about us and we literally had to wave our hands in the air to get her to come over to top it off she only delivered half of our food and left before we could even realize that things were missing there was some unidentifiable green gunk on the corner of my pancakes which had to be scraped off since the waitress never checked on us once the meals were overpriced and the portions far too small and poorly prepared to warrant this being a popular place to go for breakfast if i could give 0 stars i definitely would never coming back to this very disappointing establishmentgreat place to go if you have a lot of cash  the only thing you dont have to pay for is the bathroom and the gift shop which has nice crafts reasonably priced  in order to pick apples or pumpkins you must pay 375 per person to take the hayride  you have to wait in line to purchase ticket for hayride 20 min and then wait in line for the hayride 45 min  there are other farms just as nice in nj and reasonably priced for a family outingthey were invited to join our school event with 15 of their proceeds benefiting the school they were the busiest truck and never donated the amount they agreed too total bummeri tried repeatedly to like this place the food if and when you get it is just great didnt have a meal i didnt like the drinks are great a must try is the grande blue moon large draft of blue moon with a shot of grande mariner love it the ladies are pleasing to look upon but so few of them actually care about waiting tables oh thats what they are supposed to be there for but the bumbling management has seemingly forgotten to tell them want to see a manager about the service beg and then wait  perhaps if you are a good looking single guy you may get some service otherwise look for those tables and see if you can flag a waitress sitting with them to help you management lacks any discipline or training but i know they receive it before they get here they must all forget the hdq for the national chain should look in with secret shoppers more oftenvery disappointed first time coming to district donuts after hearing all the hype and after ordering a lemonade that was more ice then lemonade i asked if some of the ice could be removed i was told if i wanted easy ice i would have to be charged more what never heard of such a thing in my life terrible business practice unless you want to upset new customers will have to really think about driving all the way uptown to come to this place againwithout a doubt the worst customer service of any coffee shop in the country i travel endlessly for work am in a different city 3 weeks out of every month this place was the pits  came in for an iced latte and asked for only a splash of soy milk what i got was 2 shots of coffee and 12oz of soy milk when i asked them to make it again clearly restating what i wanted they made it the same  when i asked for them to please make it the way i asked i was told thats not how its done here and that they didnt care what i wanted i was asked to leave  i though i was in the soup nazi episode of seinfeld  seriously folks as much as i hate starbucks youre better off going up the streetmacarons left little to be desired some had an odd bitter taste to them go to le macaron insteadi stopped by the drivethru to pickup breakfast ordered the two burritos meal and asked for ketchup and extra salsa at the window the young woman working the takeout window at around 1000 am on june 24 2017 gave me 1 mcchicken sauce and 4 ketchup no salsa at all period put some effort in wont be stopping by there in the futureevery time i go to this pharmacy there is some sort of a problem the people who work here are rude and not helpful i have spent over an hour waiting multiple times i am definitely going to find a new pharmacyunfortunately yelp requires placement of at least one star in order to post a review but this restaurant does not rate that high  i and my friends and family visited this restaurant this evening we were disappointed in the food ordered but more importantly we were absolutely shocked at the behavior of the owner i was served a dish i did not order i did ask the server about this and she said they had run out of the ingredients to make it ok that happens but in past experience i have been notified soon after placing my order and allowed to choose something else she said the meatless version of this breaded ravioli cheese was available so i chose that it arrived after my companions finished their meals as she placed the plate on the table she immediately asked if i wanted a carryout container what i needed was a fork but that had been removed with the food they had chosen for me as i now felt very unwelcome i responded yes a server came back with a container and my bill of note i was told that my entree would be comped when the replacement meal was brought the bill didnt reflect this i was charged the full price for what i originally ordered i brought this to her attention and i did state  that in my opinion there were so many errors made that if not soon corrected could have a negative impact on their business she left  and  a man who identified himself as the owner came to our table and said he wanted to know what is the problem we informed him of the substitution and he apologized for the mistake before we had a chance to thank him for that unsolicited acknowledgement he proceeded to tell us that the servers said we were cursing and throwing things not true as we tried to deny this egregious accusation he continually interrupted us clearly his intent was to create a hostile situation which we wanted no part of my husband handed him cash to pay the bill and requested it be rung up so that the change would be given back but the owner was relentless in his argument finally the owner took the money and a server returned with the change nothing was comped and we paid for the more expensive entree for which they did not have the ingredients i have even not included in this documentation any of the cross contamination that we witnessed what a terrible experience this wasfood sucks  so does the service blahtldr miserably hot wrong orders food undercooked incorrectly billed  first it was horribly hot inside the place even at 730pm  the hostess said it had been like that for days we had a big group split between two tables  the first table got their food 15 minutes before the second table  the second table ordered an appetizer that didnt come out until the rest of the food did  the appetizer came with a side of cheese sauce that had just enough to cover the bottom of the bowel  the server immediately said he would get more  one person ordered a bison burger that they did not get but were still charged for  we had a kids grilled cheese that we had to send back because it was burnt  two other people ordered their burgers ordered medium burgers that came out raw  the general manager even agreed that it was unacceptable  she tried to over to fix it but the two of us had lost our appetites at that point  she said she would do some magic to the bill which ended up only being removing the two dishes that we sent back  also if you have a group of more than 8 people they cant split checks because that would take witchcraft i guess  all in all i will not be back to there or any of the other restaurants that this group owns roosters baileys chocolate bar ridge the fifth wheel small batch or shiftive enjoyed going here and have been many times in the past every time my fianc and i go we order the family meal that consists of a whole chicken a side of rice and rolls every single time we have ordered it weve always asked if we can have yellow rice instead of white and always offer to pay the difference with no problems last night not so much we were told we absolutely could not change the white rice to yellow because they didnt have a button to upcharge the pricewhat you need a special button on your register to charge me any additional cost for substituting yellow rice ive worked a register before and know its not hard to type in 125 or whatever it costs to make up for the difference  what happened to making your customers happy neither employeecause it took two to tell us offered any other options and just looked at us like we were aholes for even asking that question after that reaction we walked out and took our business elsewhere no patience for stupid or not accommodating to their customers wont be back any time soondont go to this one every time i visit this habit i get sick my sandwich tasted like it was smothered in cold grease it left the roof of my mouth and my teeth all greasy made me sick to my stomach the fries werent cooked all the way through and their veggie patties taste funny its like you need to taste everything before you leave with your to go order so you dont leave with crap food and the loss in funds and your meal visit the habit on upper state near lens crafters la cumbre mall they are consistent with their cooking and its always greati was craving some bbq and decided to give this place a try i took my order out but the overall look of the place was nice clean there is ample sitting for lots of people the kitchen side resembles more of a pizza kitchen but i wasnt judging i ordered the 3 meat combo platter comes with choice of 3 meats 2 sides and corn bread i also decided to try the hush puppies with spiced honey butter awesome i was so excited but after ordering i didnt see where they were getting the meats from im not sure since it was almost closing time maybe they had already put everything away i mean i have been to bbq places in texas and north carolina and they have it all ready to pull out and slice right in front of you which was actually my next question how much meat comes on the 3 meat combo i asked about 8 ounces i said wait total or each meat is about 8 ounces total so first of all what im spending 1650 for a total of 8 ounces ok i let that go since i was so excited for the bbq and was almost ecstatic about it i chose the chicken pulled pork and the brisket as well as the seasoned green beans and garlic mashed potatoes i checked out the area where they keep the sauces grabbed a couple into some to go containers and waited for my order they bagged everything up and i still never saw any actual meat being sliced or anything i was standing right there i dont understand how that one happened brought it home and started with the hush puppies they werent bad i was hoping they would be a little larger i think 810 came in the order and they were about the diameter of a quarter the spiced honey butter looked like oil with some seasonings at the very bottom which if you know how that works i never got the good flavor of the seasonings at the bottom as the butteroil consumed the whole hush puppie as i dipped it on to the meat it looked pretty good though like i said for 1650 it wasnt a whole lot  i had gone to north carolina in the beginning of the summer and got a platter that easily had 4x the amount of meat on it it had 2 bbq chicken leg quarters about 12 ounces of beef brisket half a rack of ribs and about 12 ounces of pulled pork it also came with corn bread and sides but clearly there was more meat to go around down south than there was in horsham it tasted ok the brisket was a little tough the chicken was good the pulled pork was really good  the sides ugh no taste the green beans looked like they had garlic on them but they were very bland and i can mash a potato and call it homemade but that doesnt make it good they would do well with some salt and pepper and maybe some actual garlic i dont believe anyone actually tasted the food to see if more flavor was needed i will give amazing reviews to the sauces though they stole the show and made the whole meal bearable i would actually buy them if they sold them separately but i agree with moodie f i was looking forward to trying this place out but extremely disappointed in the actual outcome  im not sure how they are getting such great reviews from some people and thats fine maybe those people havent had actual bbq before i dont knowit stinks like old fish very hard to shop in a place with a smell like that i had the nerve to circle the inside of the dirty grocery store thinking there would be a huge fish or at least dried fish section in the butcher areanope after my circle i realized that smell was probably old animal blood or something grosser than that  i really thought i would hurl in the parking lot when i made it back to my car  i dont recommend walking in at allthe food is poor over priced and the service is horrible you are better off going somewhere else than this place i personally witnessed the servers harassing a customer that was totally uncalled for maybe they wanted to close earlier i dont know but it was uncalled for stay awaydont go on third shift  my boyfriend and i have went through the drive thru and dined in here several times and it was almost never a good experience  went earlier in the day once and got much better service and food but we are night owls and have stopped coming to this location due to a variety of bad experiences  sloppy food thrown carelessly in to go bags that are all messy and greasy usually missing items a server who argued with me about what we ordered we drive to the southport rd location now  it is twice the distance from our house but i love steak n shake and they always do a good job there  i got sick of the unpleasant surprises from the emerson ave locationthis is my first review on yelp and i am doing this just to try and restore the name of greek food i visited this restaurant less than a week ago for the first time i am greek and i am telling you people this is not how greek food is supposed to taste i thought it was really really bad  i had a hot platter and a cold one both were bad the service was good the wine was good but the food not so much i am never going backthis gas station is not well maintained the pumps are frequently not working and not labeled as suchi had the chili dogs at this location and they were absolutely disgusting i repeat disgusting not only is the chili gross it doesnt taste anything like chili then on top of that they put mustard on with the chili who does this i couldnt eat them i gave them to my partner who likes mustard and even my partner found the taste to be offensive lets just say id rather eat poop than eat these hot dogs again beware do not eat the chili dogs they are disgustingwant some heroin with your cheese burger this is the mcdonalds for youwhos in the kitchen and why cant they do their job reviewed 2 days ago new i had high hopes for this eatery but i got over that with just one visit arrived a little after 12pm on a perfectly lovely day with four other adult family members the restaurant makes a nice impression with its white beadboard trim and large windows im thinking this is going to be nice we were seated fairly quickly once they had converted a square table to round to accommodate our party of five the waitress was friendly and attentive at first took our orders poured our beverages etc tick tock it took 45 minutes before our food was served if 5 is a big party they are in big trouble but the fun doesnt stop there out of 5 entrees there were 3 errors mom asked for sausage she got bacon sister asked for multi grain bread she got sour dough hubby ordered a tuscany omelet and got a western my tuna melt was accurate but miserably cold okay lets go with 4 out 5 my brotherinlaw was happy with his cuban were still trying to figure out how that happened my advice skip itcheese omelette 1200 maybe two eggs and three small complimentary potatoes orange juice 500 side of avocado 500 eat in the land of oprah priceless  if you want to hear men with small penises talk about their helicopters with their mistresses then this is the spot if youd like a worthwhile affordable meal go elsewhere    when i asked the very nice waitress if they meant to give me three potatoes she said they were complementary lolnot the best buffet option in the area everything  is bland and tastes like it is reheated from frozen samosas are especially mediocre  go around the corner to new delhi or sitar indiai usually love cosi but this is literally the worst one by far that i have ever been to cashier was rude to begin with and then my order of two salads  a soup was made incorrectly four times the cashier didnt apologize even once the salads when we finally got them were terrible  watery and over dressed and the bread was stone cold   for the record here is how they got my order wrong i ordered a steakhouse salad a small tomato soup regular bread and a signature salad with no cranberries and light dressing  first  wrong bread type and no soup second  wrong soup  third  my salad came with cranberries and regular dressing fourth  my salad came with no cheesethis is the worst walgreens that i have ever been too no matter what time you go there is at least a 40 minute wait to pick up a prescription to make it even worst they used to have two drivethru and now they only have one they are either way under staffed or too damn cheap to hire enough people to do something about the wait terrible just terrribleunfortunately i cannot give 5 stars i rarely eat fast food but im not hard to please as long as i get what im paying for this has to be the nastiest restaurant ive ever stepped foot in and i was so surprised it was a wendys ive never been to wendys and the food was not freshever granted its been probably a year or so since ive eaten wendys if this is what theyve become then ill pass the floors were sticky and slippery the customer service was ok at best and the food taste like it was sitting for hours there were two soft drink machines buy only one dispense ice and the other drink and both of those look like they were not cleaned since they powered it on when i went to refill my moms cup i noticed the ice dispenser had black mold i assume i did not refill and at that point we left everything was sticky to touch or brokenthere was a little 3 yr old girl that slipped while her mum was holding her hand in the order line this really discourage me even more from eating fast food which is probably a good thingwow not sure why my experience was so bad but it was i figured i stop and try two tacos at this place and i was very disappointed the sauted shrimp taco was terrible it was like boiled shrimp with a sauce that tasted like i was eating a mouth full of mayonnaise come on put the shrimp on a flat top and sear them with some seasoning for gods sake and putt something else on there other than lettuce and basically mayo the crispy chicken taco was far from crispy it was cold and there is no way they fried the chicken because my order came out in about 10 minute my food came out so fast i feel like it was sitting around premade i did get a donut and it was actually very good but when i asked how much for a dozen they told me 1800 that is pretty expensive for a dozen donuts i have such better tacos only word of advice is that maybe you should sell donuts instead because you tacos just didnt do it for mewell first off i frequent this tropical smoothie location 23 times a week for the last 2 years since moving to the historic ne today i ordered a smoothie and left the store as usual i took a sip on the way up 4th st the taste of this smoothie was sour and foul the ingredients for this particular smoothie were spoiled or bad i returned to the store to return it and told the young girl about my smoothie i asked her if they could take the spoiled smoothie back and give me a different smoothie that didnt include the same ingredients she was very rude and said we dont take back smoothies but we can make you the same smoothie over for you now why would i want the same smoothie with the bad ingredients  i left the smoothie on the counter told her to taste it and left the store i think the manager needs to be aware of this and a response would be appreciated  mddidnt deserve 12 star waited 2 hours for a room asked three times for towels and never received anythis place  lets seeeverything here is 15 or 2x more expensive than any other market in the city  i can handle thatits the price of convenience  what i cannot handle are the godawful cashiers  could they be any more rudeunhappy  im not expecting my cashier at my local supermarket to shit sunshine and rainbowsthats what whole foods is for  what i do expect is an answer when i greet them  arent they supposed to greet me and ask how are you  helloi dont really give a shit how you are doing  i only ask because it is polite and the least they can do is respond with a 1 word answerso ive been to this manhattan a few times now  unfortunately this trip was my last  i ordered 2 empire state club sandwiches  these sandwiches are suppose to come with a drink side and pickle conveniently placed in a box with a fork and napkin  after ordering and paying 15 dollars for the two sandwiches i was handed two drink cups   theses drinks would have been filled with iced coffee being that it was 745 in the morning but as i turned around to my dismay there was no iced coffee  that was fine though i realize its busy in the morning and somebody just hasnt got to it yet  then it turned to the south  as i mentioned before the meal is suppose to come in a box but when my order was called the only thing that showed up were two brown paper bags  when i asked arent these suppose to come with a side the ladys response was we dont have any sides but you can take a bag of chips  cool a solution or so i thought  i look over where she pointed but there was nothing but the bottom of a basket staring back at me  just like my hopes of a good sandwich when i walked in  in conclusion just drive past this place  terrible establishment with no care taken in the least biti feel guilty  my girl and i just walked into a private hipster party thinking it was a restaurant the name blue moon pizza must have made me think this was a place that caters to hungry people looking for someone to cook them good food in a reasonable time frame but i was wrong   we ordered a couple waters and a beer from the hipster girl that lost the coin toss that decided who had to serve us best 2 out of 3 beer was warm wonder who brought warm beer to the party we got some garlic knots that most people would call bread with cold marinara sauce then we sat there watching people talk looking in from the outside it was just like high school roughly 45 minutes later our bbq chicken pizza came then the heartburn came shortly after   someone should tell them that you dont have to thaw out the frozen pizza before you cook it they would improve wait times by a substantial amount if they just toss it in frozen   anyway thanks blue moon for not kicking us out of your private gathering cool tattoos toook food bad crews and horrible customer service at lowery zoo  not sufficient signage to charge extra for credit card but wanted to charge additional 100 for a 899 platei visited this place because hey i figured its nice to support family owned places boy was i wrong the place is way over priced next time im going to costco save some money and my taste buds and buy some wedges  vons psshh 10 bucks for a handful of wedges are you kidding me never again and i would never recommendthe employees are rude and mumble so much i could barely understand them i went twice in a month and both times my orders were wrong when i clearly said what i wanted to buy the kitchen looked dirty and unkept when i pulled up to pay and as i was driving up to speaker the lady inside was yelling for help the rest of the staff were in back smoking and playing i will not waste my money at this location for food cooked in a dirty kitchen by employees who clearly dont like their job and cant even fake a smileslow drive through service 2 cars ahead of you  2025 mins wait average snowballs and check your order they didnt add the condensed milk that i paid forthis location is the worst the manager wouldnt even refund us our money after we told them we didnt even want the cold pizza they delivered instead offered us a 16 credit to which we had spent around 32 on top of that she wouldnt give us a corporate number to complain on and then suddenly changed from the manager to the gm and she didnt have time for this we finally after 2 months decided to take advantage of our 16 credit in which i still had to pay 5 out of pocket for still cold pizza im all about second and maybe third chances but this place has lost it their ghetto manager needs an attitude check quickly if shes going to treat customers like that she needs to relocate to the east side where she will surly fit in betterwe have dined there before but tonight i was absolutely crushed and disappointed do not book them on open table we went to our reservation at our appointed time they tried to seat us at a counter with no backs on the seats this was unacceptable especially as it was my husbands 50th birthday and i had put it in the notes as such its open table not open half counter the host told us there were no tables we were not late for our reservation so obviously they are overstating their table allotment furious luckily we were on east passyunk where many excellent restaurants are steps away will never book there againwow i just cant really say anything good about this place i made the mistake of ordering sushi with my food and it was probably the worst sushi ive had in my life not only that but i was about to leave because the food took so long not coming back here againstopped in today for a quick bite and to use the restroom  i hate to be negative but oh my god the lobby was dirty  the mens restroom was out of order  i ordered 1 burrito im not kidding i waited over ten minutes for that burrito  they werent even busy come on taco bell  fix this this place was nasty my next phone call will be to the health department ewwwwworst taco bell ive ever been in and i know they are fast food and not some fancy place been several times they never have any ice in the machine out front and the beverages are flat or stale the trash cans are running over and the service is slow wont be back  i can only imagine how they prepare the food really dont want to think about thathorrible horrible horrible if you want to eat below average mexican food while feeling like you are in a day care with terrible service come here terrible food screaming children slow service the only positive thing this restaurant has is its decor i have been to multiple mad mex locations and this place is by far the worst save the money and go to chipoltei have visited this place a number of times so i must be insane as i keep doing the same thing expecting a different result stopped by on may way home to grab something for dinner i am not one who will make changes to a menu item and was looking forward to the promotional nashville hot chicken was told there would be a little wait which i expected 25 minutes later as my order is being prepared i am told that there is no dark meat which isnt a big deal but then i hear how the drive thru continued to sell the same items i have been waiting for the crew appeared to be doing what they could to keep up but there did not appear to be any coordination between the dining room and drive thru when it came to filling orders it was very difficult for my not to be that guy as i got my order may have to drive to a different town next time i want kfcokay food good prices but you literally have to beg for a refill of coffee and dont sit at the counter they do their side work there and stack dirty dishes and spray bottles of detergent right next to you while you eat also the staff  spends all their time gossiping with each other about their babys fathers wildwood and tv shows while you sit there waiting for service also the atmosphere is lousy feels like youre eating in a dentist office waiting roomi am so disappointed i am a new hope resident and a foodie as such i am always looking for new quality restaurants in the area i especially love cuban cuisine and couldnt wait to try mojitos well dont waste your time the restaurant industry is so competitive to begin withif a restaurant owner starts out by trying to cut corners theyll never succeed we began by ordering drinks disgusting my mojito was basically lime juice with mint and it had an acidity flavor my friends margarita tasted like dirty dish water it just got worse from there we waited 15 hours for our entrees and we were the only people there the shrimp appetizer tasted very fishy the guacamole had no flavor and was brown indicative of old avocados i can go on but im sure you get the point basically just another tourist restaurant in new hope with bad food and over priced drinks that will be closed within the next yearhusband and i along with a couple of friends tried sylvias last weekend  basically dont waste your time  the restaurantbar are beautifully decorated in a modern style  thats where the good stuff ended  after bring seated quickly we waited for almost 15 minutes for our server to appear  we placed our drink order and about 10 minutes later the drinks arrived  unfortunately our friends were presented with two glasses of water  not the diet cokes they ordered  this time it only took 57 minutes for the server to show up with the correct drinks  it went downhill from there    after going through half a dozen choices they didnt have tonight we finally found something that was available and ordered i ordered the harlem style chicken and waffle edible husband had smothered chicken very salty  we finally got to eat  after an hour  while we were waiting another server was wandering around the dining room asking random people if they had already ordered  every table around ours had already ordered and were impatiently waiting  we wont be back  weird place with mediocre food and horrible service  spend your money elsewhere  perhaps mcdonalds if i could give zero stars i would this is one of the dirtiest bread co that i have ever been at bread co has been slacking a lot in my opinion from wrong orders to poor costumer serviceworkers literally throw your stuff down the conveyor belt nothing is ever stocked  for example this past trip they had no milk  not just giant brand milk but they had no milk going to the giant in aston from now oni always come here and im extremely disappointed with the way everything is i been waiting for my food for about 45 minutes they said they had no chicken they never told us they didnt have any ready we went to ask and they told us 15 minutes its been 45 minutes and they still havent bought our food out everything seems very dirty i will definitely notify the county so that they can come check this restaurant im definetely not coming back here anymore horrible servicethe concrete that i ordered is like milk shake nothing frozen about  it is not all as good as all the hype very disappointed  ate two bites and dumped in trash  what a waste of time and moneyi had fairly high expectation before i came but the serving here really upset me we ordered at 106pm but the dishes didnt come until 145 whats even worse our waitress brought our check 5 minutes later we didnt finish half of the food yet its a very frustrating experiencedo not go to this vineyard i have never been to such a disrespectful organization group at any vineyard before dont waste your money at their wine so rudevery upsetting experience today i drove 30 minutes to come here and was informed they were out of the ingredients to make quite a few sandwiches i then asked where the next quiznos was and they listed off a bunch that have recently closed so i asked where subway is and they stated they didnt know because they arent from the area you work here you know terrible experienceservice what service he didnt even get my order right the food was tasteless and im 56 110 pounds after a whole bowl of noodles i was still hungry  their bubble tea was the worst  no customer service what so ever if it was busy i can understand but the restaurant was empty when we went never going back not authentic at alli dont even know where to start with this review but maaaaaaaaaan every time that i go to dream tea i die inside with four locations in the city now the dream tea empire is taking over edmonton thank god theres a couple new bbt shops in town to give them some much needed competition step it up yumioca purple bubble tea and simply yours cafe  ive been to their og location too many times to count because everyone in town adores them to pieces i have no idea why prices are expensive but doesnt correlate to quality  dream 525  this is a top sellers and apparently the only drink my friend ever gets here its made of taro and coconut she asked for half sweet but holy crap it tasted like pure sugar powdered drinks  gross she even agreed it was terrible and she iswas a big fan of dream tea so thats saying something  mango dream 630  this one consists of mango and peach better than my friends but barely passable we couldnt taste any peach but apple juice seemed to be the dominant flavour in my drink not to mention it tasted really watered down for a fresh fruit drink i didnt taste any fruit at least the mango stars were decent  hopefully people stop settling for mediocrity at least i converted one personseriously though why is it so hard to find a good bbt shop in townterribly disappointed in the town  country location the toasted ravioli tasted like it was freezer burnt the pesto that came with it looked almost black not fresh at all the gnocchi was inedible the texture was all wrong the glassware looked dirty the whole dinner lacked qualityused to enjoy the food to go  until tonight i stay at the hotel next door frequently and place orders to go once or twice a week  called tonight to order the blue plate special and he said you can not have the blue plate special to go  i said thats funny i ordered the meatloaf monday to go which was the special that day and he said if you want the special you can come in and eat it  no more for me and congratulations on losing not only my business but the associates i have that stay here alsoterribly slow service staggeringly high prices and tonight it was 5 minutes to 10 oclock and the hostess looked at me and said we just closed their loss was pie fives gain thats ok we discovered we were in the mood for pizza anywayi went to join my moms friends for their weekly lunch  the restaurant is in a backwater strip mall near the corner of st charles and carrollton    we all shared some corn meal battered oysters that was very good  our waitress told us that the mahi mahi and salmon were local  obviously she was misinformed  neither fish is local    i had a shrimp poboy which was average nothing great  i tasted my moms mahi mahi which was very well done despite having been frozen  overall the food is decent  but the kicker was the cost  just way too expensive especially the fish of the dayservice was horrible it should not take 20 minutes for 2  crispy chicken tacos this is the third time i have visited this place and had slow service to all that plan to come to sweet taco on your lunch break dont it will take the whole time just to get your foodunfortunate slow drive thru and customer service seems to be less than desired exterior of building need some cleanup and a few light bulbs replaced this is probably a lack of effort on management and should be brought to their attention if you have the opportunity to choose a starbucks you may want to skip this location or delete 20 minutes from your lifestaff was uncourteous and refused to provide us service because we only wanted snacks and not a full meal if it is a policy please mention it on your menu walked a minute to new delhi restaurant and had the most amazing veg platter everwe went on a wok n walk tour around chinatown with chef poon while hes clearly a very enthusiastic person this was far from a real culinary tour instead this was more like an opportunity for chef poon to talk about himself and to boast about his accomplishments and life story chef poon has evidently had a successful career but many of the things he said were difficult to believe at best furthermore it seemed impossible for him to talk about the virtues of his cooking and his life philosophy without criticizing the cooking and philosophy of others i found that negative and unnecessary when he could sense that members of the group were not buying everything he was saying or were more interested in looking around he was rather rude and critical of those people his remarks were couched in humor but they were inappropriate and took away from the experience i found the assumptions he made about people that all americans are rich and have never had to work for anything and are lazy and their interests that women would want to hear about herbsspices that have been traditionally used for abortions to be absolutely ridiculous and offensive finally the meal served at the end of the tour by this chef who suggested he had recently been visited by 15 of the top chefs in the country served sweet and sour chicken with rice and a salad  hardly inventive cuisine i do not recommend this tour for anyone  out of towners or those who reside in philadelphia as i do  and especially not people who have been on food tours elsewherecame here with a group of friends on a friday night the restaurant wasnt very busy yet our server managed to get something wrong on 47 of our orders we then tried to request the missing items twice and were forgotten about finally the manager came over and tried to meet our needs the best he could but the food was no where near our expectations he then proceeded to act aggressively almost like he was mad at me for not enjoying the food overall terrible experienceive had two experiences with this place both have been rather unpleasant the first time i dined in and ordered the vegan ramen the food was fine although when i asked them if they could make it spicy the answer was no so that was a bit bizarre but no worries what got me is that while we were eating our water was never once refilled and when we asked for the check it took 47 minutes i timed it to arrive   the second experience was last night i decided order via the waitr app and ordered a poke bowl the app allows you to select ingredients from a menu and add them to a dish when the food arrived it filled less than half the normal sized container it arrived in it was also missing half the ingredients i had selected i have never been so disappointed in a meal in my life the portion wasnt even enough to feed a child this is the first time ive felt inclined to leave a poor review and i think its extremely warrantedjust terrible the spaghetti carbonara took forever to make and arrived as a bland pile in a bowl will not be backthis place is on a decline and fast cold soup 3xs and everything else wasnt nearly as good as when it first opened what a shamecame in for salmon mac and sweets which was okay the salmon was burnthard and way too oily the mac was oily as well the yams were actually good the buttered roll was hard and cold customer service is absolutely horrible at this establishment the cashier was very rude and unprofessional she was on her phone and conversing with staff in the back without acknowledging the people waiting in line also the food took every bit of a half hour to cook will not be returningvisited the pancake pantry this past saturday 13115 heard this place was the 1 spot for breakfast in nashville and that the long line  wait was worth it not so much after waiting an hour in line we then had to wait 49 minutes for omelettes my omelette had a hair in it after tracking down our waitress to let her know she promptly took my plate to the kitchen no apology nothing the hashbrowns arent hashbrowns theyre potatoes crispy potatoes that were delicious thats the only thing that was good so not worth the wait it was definitely a hairy experience but i wont be back for future visitsfor 13 i ordered a chicken plate that came with one orange slice the slightest bit of salad and chicken and no rice even though its meant to be includedjust ordered a triple delight chefs special it was supposed to contain chicken beef and shrimp  only contained chicken  single delight same price single star review  serve what you promise on the menusighthis place has to be the most hypedup overrated slider not burger place i have ever eaten at no skill no flavor and no creativity coming out this kitchen for sure baileys get it together please   pickles were pretty good however my preference for fried foods is breadcrumbs not tasteless easy to prepare batter the rest of this review however is truly not based off of my preference but on common sense burger expectations   their burgers should all be called sliders they are so small and thin and just thrown between cold yogamat ingredient buns onto an overcompensated oven tray with thin measly toppings hanging off the side   first of all i asked the waitress how pink their medium burger is and she said its mostly pink because the mediumwell has barely a sliver of pink so i ordered a medium ballpark pretzel burger and my husband ordered a medium american burger unfortunately mine came out completely bone dry well done my husbands burger came out mediumwell but barely any pink   in addition to the dry overcooked meat we both cringed at the taste of the cheese sauce on our burgers oh my goodness gracious idk if it was homemade cheese sauce or from a can but it tasted absolutely horrendous like a cheap peanut butter cheese wiz sauce   so i said no way please make me a totally different burger the basic create your own now with sliced white cheddar bacon and red onion medium this time my husband was starving so he just ate his he has more tolerance for the bs these restaurants are serving up these days anyways  my second burger comes out now so the waitress asks that i cut into it for her and sure enough it is hard as a brick and more well done than the first one i didnt think it was possible but before i could say anything the waitress said omg i am so sorry and grabbed it away to get yet another one made for me  my third burger comes out and my husband is done eating his slider by now so i cut into the burger again for the waitress and now there is only a sliver of pink definitely not medium and closer to medium well but even more chewy than the first one the waitress said is this ok i said not really but my husband is already done and i wanna leave so i took a few bites out of the third burger and left the rest for my husband who was still clearly starving after eating his mini snack of a slider the attached photo is of the 3rd burger before i gave it to my husband   it was so bad even besides being extremely dry and overcooked it was truly tasteless and a little chewy did they just shape ground beef into a patty and call it a burger i mean really no seasonings no splash of personality or creativity to make it their own range burger i have had tastier juicer burgers at wholeinthewall diners  oh and the buns have you ever seen those kids kitchen play sets with the squishy burger bun that takes it original shape back as soon as you let it go yeah thats exactly how both the pretzel bun and regular bun was ew i think that was the worst part they were cold greasy and must have had the yogamat ingredient in it a burger bun should be slightly toasted fresh and lightly buttered the bun should be the second most important ingredient to the meat   the toppings were pathetic my red onions were thinner than the red onions in the watermelon salad and looked as if they were soaking in water and lost their freshness the bacon was not crispy or worthy at all it was floppy and chewy   my husbands burger the american burger with macaroni and cheese and bacon had a melon baller dolup of mac n cheese and tons of that questionable cheese sauce he too said whoaaa whats going on with that sauce and made a confused face   thank goodness for the french fries and watermelon salad or else i would have left starving the fries were really good actually they were warm had seasonings and seemed fresh watermelon salad wasnt the best but wasnt bad it was actually refreshing   the bourbon bacon milkshake was pretty good too because it had chopped bacon in the mix as well as two strips sticking out   the brussels sprouts looked so disgraceful and lonely with their lackluster wilted cherry tomatoes and halfmelted cheese on top all scattered in an oversized casserole dish   its actually funny now thinking about this meal burgers are their main item and they failed miserably i dont know how they stay in business or how people can rant and rave about this place its not like i got one bad burger i had three make that four if you count my husbands dry ol sad slidersized burger  the journey for a decent burger in st lou continuesnever going again very slow and rude service they didnt honor a coupon correctly and refused to give me the correct deal then i made an additional order at the drive thru i waited 20 minutes for fries and two drinks one of them being a sweet tea i got home to realize the tea wasnt sweet and the receipt had my correct order on it the workers are terrible and that location deserves to be shut down going to oxford valley next timethey should be ashamed to call their product food kids on grill dont care at all about quality  who runs this place the staff is nothing but lazy ghetto kids playing on their phones they make sandwiches at their convenience  i ordered  no one cooked anything for like 10 minutes  only after the punk finished his conversation with a co worker did he consider starting my order later saw the cook rolling a blunt in his car in the parking lot on his break no wonder the food and service sucks theregreat food horrible service we drove all the way home to find out that our burrito we ordered wasnt in the bag we drove back to get it and she already had the same burrito ready in the bag for us didnt even offer a newfresh one all she said was sorry unfortunately it appears to be a lack of training and management it isnt really her fault personally its poor training and managementflying from jamaica montego bay on jetblue flight 480 to jfk  diverted to philadelphia airport due to a sick passenger suffering from some type of seizure still sitting here on the plane even after medical personnel removed the sick passenger no update from the crew as to what is happening or what we should expect at least update passengers we have empathy for the sick passengers however jetblue needs to handle the with better professionalismabsolutely the worst taco bell  i waited 31 minutes in the drivethru only to get home with an incorrect order  the employees here are incompetent and dont care  we wont be going back as this experience is the trendomg i walked in and the smell of dirty mop and wet rags was so strong i lost my appetite as soon as i walked in it was highly disappointing because i love pizza hut with sadness and disgust i turned right around and walked out my ride home i was nauseous not coolno way am i ever coming back here i will purposely walk out of my way to avoid the area when im at this particular mall even upstairs to avoid their very presence i asked for a small bag of tea and ended up being charged 150 dollars for the largest bag they carry it all happened so fast and now im out a full days paycheck for something i cannot return after the three minute bait and switch routine i was just given if you like your space and hate to be oversold avoid these guys  i found the entire experience so unpleasant that  even though i now have a 150 credit to the store because of course once you cross the stores threshold all tea is unreturnable even in my case of the aboutface return i did just moments after purchasing my overpriced dried goods i will not be back hopefully i can pass it off to another tea enthusiast hopefully far from the pushy and borderline assaulting employees of la encantadai ordered the america burger  this is not a burger  it is ground meat on a biscuit like half bun  the portion was a child size and with a can of pop it was almost 9  the taste was not so great whatsoever  very disappointing to say the least  i will not be back  at least at the gov ctr cafe you can buy a real beef burger for 4  i give freds no stars but yelp is making me so670 for a 24 oz blended snickers this is 2 more than any other coffee shop i have gone to in the entire valley for the exact same drink never in my life did i expect to pay almost 7 for a coffee   the staff is very sweet but doesnt seem to know what they are doing i havent been out of the drive through yet any sooner than 10 min for one drink i have also seen other people behind me back out of the drive through and leave because they were frustrated on multiple occasions hopefully with time they will get a lot quicker and more efficient i dont see this new location lasting otherwisewhat a stinky restaurant  the restroom is right smack in the middle restaurant when the door open you can see the toilet and  the smell was disgusting  i had been to several third world countries and i had never seen a set up like this  talking about losing appetite  hope im not the only one that dont like to eat close to where i take a dumpi would have left this review on mcdonalds website but unfortunately you need a receipt to do that  there was no receipt in my to go bag when i got home  first of all the wait was unreal  at least three cars behind me that had already ordered gave up and drove away  after waiting 25 minutes to finally get my food i drove home to eat it  well the fries were good and hot  but the fish filet that is another story entirely  this might be the worst sandwich i ever had i didnt even finish it and i was really hungry  i can honestly say this was the worst sandwich i have ever had in my 47 years of life  how can you have a bun that is char black and have a piece of fish that is ice cold with the texture of cardboard  i literally think i am starting to get sick right now as i just finished my half sandwich about 15 minutes ago  i truly wish i had been as smart as the cars behind me that bailed  to be honest it is very rare that i eat at mcdonalds  this may be the last time as long as i live  i am going to go throw up nowi and a friend went to this establishment at 830 pm sharp and the young man working their said as soon as we walked in that they stop taking dine in orders at 845 pm my friend said to me lets go some were else i said ok the employee said sorry about that when i got out side the front door i seen the hours of operation that said open till 900 pm i thought this was very strange to turn away buisness 30 minutes before closing ps im a handicap person on crutches i will never go their again nor recommend to anyone joethere just isnt much that i can say on a positive note about the food i am a burger lover and was so thrilled when this place opened down the street from school  i popped in on my lunch break 1 12 hours and decided to dinein  i was impressed with the selection of hand crafted soda and asked the waitress if any of the other flavors came in diet her response oh yes all of our sodas are caffeine free uhm ok  i ordered the trainwreck and believe me its a fitting name for it  worst burger ever  it was all one note there was cheese fries meat some wacky sauce and who knows what else but i couldnt taste any of it  it was just bland and boring  most importantly they were slow  i sat in the dining room for a good 30 minutes and counted the number of people that i saw with food  two tables 3 people  thats it i waited so long that  i asked for my food to go  i barely made it back in time for class  go to red robin go to 5 guys heck go to mcdonaldsjust dont eat hereawful  service was fine food was just plain bad the chef need to be replaced along wth the menu  dont waste your money  decor  is trying to be eclectic but ends up making the food worsewent here because my brother and his wife have never been to it theyve been to texas de brazil in orlando and wanted to try a different steakhouse  it was pretty bad 17 meats served that night and we get flank steak offered to us 4 out of the 9 times we were offered meats i had to specifically ask for top sirloin and when that came the slice was small and dry in fact all the meat slices for the steaks were small and laughable for the price what was even funnier was a server was telling another table that texas de brazil gives smaller portions when i have a guy sawing tiny pieces of steak with the majority of it falling on the table ive been to texas de brazil the portions were much bigger and the top sirloin was not a once in a lifetime offer   overall it was more disappointing on all fronts and for the high price definitely not worth it what was even more odd was that it was a party of four adults and 1 child turning 2 years old this year and we were charged gratuity for a party of 5 i thought that was a bit ridiculous   i say if you want to go to a great steakhouse go to texas de brazil for good portions and great service its definitely your monies worth the only thing that i would say boizao has on texas de brazil is the caipirinha since boizao uses real fruit and texas de brazil uses fruit juices at least since i have been there not sure if they have changed that  edit texas de brazil now has  caipirinhas with real fruit done dealfred myers jewelers in boise town square mall manager steve is a bold faced liar  one of my diamond earrings just fell out because they make the backs poorly so youll lose the earrings and have to replace them  the backs are horrible  the day after i had my earrings checked for their insurance purposes one fell out  steve promised to credit both earrings if i upgraded  today i went in to do the upgrade and steve said he never promised me anything of the sort  he is a bold faced liar and i will never to business with them again or the grocery store  integrity if everything and fm has nonethis is the worst mcdonalds i have ever been too waited 25 minutes for food and customer service was horrendous ordered coffee that was flavored they took the order and money with no problem then as we were getting our order we got regular coffee instead of what we orders because the machine was broken and we were not told  do not come here there are other mcdonalds close by that are way betterfucking piss poor service  mediocre food  this burger king need not too be in service any longer dont  even bother on wasting your time  eating here nor stopping at this establishment unless you have to use the rest room  i rather eat gas station food fast food isnt not rocket science  how do you screw up  meat  bread cheese and toppings      just patheticcold premade sandwiches for about 9 a piece with no sides msy airport post security has you trapped with limited food options  the terminals are not connected so if youre in d then youre staying in d for your dining experience  experiencing a 4 hour delay on a recent day i found myself with limited choices to feed the family  basically it was this place or the chicken shack close to security  for the privilege of consuming 4 cold wraps i shelled out 50  this is downright robbery in a town that boasts such fine dining establishments   my suggestion is that you avoid the airport and eat outside before your flight  even a carryout option from somewhere is better than eating here  also as a side note no decent coffee shops either in the terminalthis place has good food but waiting an hour for ten wings is horrible will never be backsome memorabilia nothing too special constant stench of smoke but what do you expect should really have something crazy to offer if youre going to charge for parkingmy americano misto was brutal great looking cafe and the food looked really good i guess i should of had a snack instead  take a pass on the coffeei ordered a onsie cake for a baby shower and it didnt look anything like the picture i showed them it didnt look like a perfessional cake it looked like i made it at home the taste was just ok i would never go here again and pay 5500 for a cake i could have made myselfwell if u just cant get enough of that rude ny attitude that the rest of us americans love so much then this is the place for you  service was beyond awful we were one of 3 tables in the place and the tall female server was short with everyone had a bad attitude when a few members of our party were being friendly and just seemed miserable ill spare the details but we all agreed wed never be back again one of the 6 of us owns 6 restaurants and he was saying its just shocking how many bad restaurants  like this one  come and go in his business the location is the only hail mary for this place he was saying as the one time tourist business is their only hope since the pizza was sub par also and none of us will be back a couple with a young child actually got up and left after an initial interaction with our same rude waitress not sure what was said but thats just award level bad business practice summary not good pizza rude service and overpriced i never thought id ever recommend hooters in my life but its next door and any place that serves food and drinks would be a better experience than this place trust me edit i had to come back and point out to look at the 36 yelp reviews that are not recommended for some reason  or owner antics they are all 1 star about unbelievably rude service and bad pizza check them out and avoid this place kicking a mother and her children out while her husband picks up food as a kind business owner in tampa who loves this city and the people go back to ny with your garbage pizza and rudeness at least get a clue precinct my lordthis starbucks is very rude always seem to have smart remarks arent very updated on new drinks and almost try to make you feel stupid for saying something wrong this starbucks location is a bad review in itselfwent during busy time and it was an awful experience waitress didnt know the menu meal came out in sections so by the time everything i ordered came out 12 the meal was cold bacon was uncooked wont be back again unless i come very earlyunfortunately there was nothing to review met a friend for a meeting and with three people behind the bar not one of them asked us if we wanted anything we were there for an hour and left without ever being spoken toowow  this is literally the worst mcdonalds in existence  there are no plugs anywhere so this is an obvious problem  but there is not even a plug in the bathroom  the floors are pretty dirty but it wont kill you to walk on them however the place is very fucked up  it took more then 20 minutes to receive my order after paying  the wrap was cold like as though it had literally been refrigerated for long enough to not be hot but not for long enough to taste like a cold salad would and the burger patty literally tasted like cardboard  it tasted like they had left it out at room temperature until it started to taste bad and then reheated it again after that several times  the things were thrown extremely carelessly into the bag the wrap was at the bottom the boxed burger was on its side on top of it and the napkin was rolled up in a cylinder on the side of this  the onions on the side were in a box and these were thrown in upsidedown after having forgotten them before i said something again  and most importantly when i order the four dollar frozen drink on a whim they did not fill the cup up all the way and then refused to refund it  i say we should stage a lynch mob burning of this buildingi was so excited about this place which is why it pains me that im writing this we picked up dinner tonight and heres the low down the staff was rude and inattentive  the food was cold the potatoes in the potato salad were under cooked the mac  cheese was sitting in a literal puddle of grease and the corn bread was like eating sand oh and it was ridiculously expensive for the quantity of food served super small portions  youd think a place like this would step up their game to gain a following or at the very least for fathers day well stick with sweet lucys   nice decor thoughlets ignore the customers  its fun  seriously if i wasnt starving i would have walked out  oh yeah rude is apparently on the menuordered a 9 inch steak and cheese wished i never did absolute garbage barely any steak barely any toppings what a waste of money dont order from this placewent here for lunch waited 30 min for a salad a wrap and a sandwich all which came at different timeswho would think people want to eat together lol when we asked the girl behind the counter where our food was after 20 minutes of waiting she said they were about to start it no apologies or anything from her we waited another 1015 minutes while the girls behind the counter just joked around and did not check on anyones order and numerous people were waiting extensively long once we got the food the chicken was dry  all around bad experience service food and experiencei am disgusted i shop here about once a month out of convenience though its expensive i always had decent experiences here well not this week i bought prepackaged oscar meyer turkey breast on thursday july 24th friday night i decide to make myself a sandwich saturday morning at 3 am wake up with horrible stomach pains and proceed to vomit three times had no idea why until now while cleaning out my fridge use by date on the turkey breast is june 4th seriously never again will i shop here one would think with their high prices that rittenhouse market would supply their patrons with quality and safe products stay awaythe pharmacy here is incompetent i dont throw this word around lightly but we are talking truly should be shut down they have given me the wrong medication and would have given me the wrong medication several times after that if i was not on top of my own medical care if anyone receives multiple medications or the lesser love you miss you want you who may be easily confused this is a place to stay away fromtime for this dinosaur to be bought out or call it a day high prices mediocre fruits and veggies and if you can believe for as slow as it has become not enough staff during the rare busy times slowwww checkout did you guys not hear about giant being built you had a couple years to get your act togetherthis chipotle is the worst you are greeted by the manager who yells money walking to the counter staff as you enter this location they get grief if they dont acknowledge her call the service is slow so theres always a line the cooked peppers and onions are usually burnt the scoop portions are on the small side so order double meat i have been here at least 10 times and requested cilantro every time ive only gotten it once every other time ive gotten some excuse hit the willow grove location it has crazy long lines but you will leave satisfiedbeware my husband and i were here the other night in the drive thru and the girl dropped the ice scooper on the floor and rinsed it and put it back in the ice really how gross and a good way to get someone sick we went in and got our money back and cancelled our order we will not return to this location she should of gotten a new clean ice scooper so all the people who ate there that night has dirty ice i honestly think i will never eat jack in box again after seeing this it was horrifyingnot very happy with this store or their customer service we just had our order delivered and our breadsticks came plain with no butter or seasoning on them at all when i called i was told i could bring them back and they then argued that they put butter and seasoning on them why would i call if they did and why would i bring them back i had my order delivered for a reason they were very rude and did not offer to replace or fix the order  not even an apologyblue moon pizza now has outrageous prices  not to mention their always snooty condescending nasty wait staff yesterday we picked up a medium pizza with three toppings that cost more than twenty dollars and when i called today to pricecheck that pizza and complain about the prices cameron said no problem go to round table then talk about the opposite of customer service just wanted to get the word out to fellow renoites enough already of a place that believes its better than its customersok so this has got to be the worst mc donalds ever  its a shame because it s a nice new facility but every single time we have tried it they manage to make it the worst experience ever  horrible service long waits for ill prepared foods  i know its mc donalds but come on  this is ridiculous  whoever is in charge needs to take notice and shape upthe absolute worse service every single time the blizzards are always sloppy and looked like a 7 year old poured them the slowest drive through the employees do not wear gloves disgusting and so so so so so sooooo rudewe selected this place because of the high yelp ratings  unfortunately im bummed out that of all the places we could have gone for dinnerwe ended up here very disappointed with the experience  to find this place you have to walk all the way to the end of stearns wharf which is no big deal because we were already there  by no means is this the only restaurant in the area but since we were on the wharf i pulled it up on yelp and it had many many favorable reviews so we thoughtlets give it a shot    upon arrival you place your name on a list hanging from the post just outside the entrance to the restaurant   you can indicate eating indoors at  one of the few tables outdoors or first available  we were in no rush and it was a nice afternoon so we opted for outdoors  the restaurant is very small with even fewer tables outside service was below par  the waiter even apologized and selfadmitting he forgot about us after leaving us for 10 minutes and not returning to take our order  the menu is typical seafood with specialization in crab and lobster my two kids were with me and unfortunately their taste buds arent at the level to pick from the menu i asked the waiter if they offered a kids  menuthey got three choices chicken dinos grilled cheese sandwhich or pasta i opted for the crabcakes and my husband for the shrimp tacos  i wish i had read steve is reviewi couldnt agree more with his description of the crab cakes  i would assume that if you are calling a dish crab cakes that there would be some crab in it maybe  they were a mushy mess  could not find lumps of crab nor taste the crab  i wont complain about the skimpy size since it would have been a complete waste of food  the crab cakes came with a garnish of onion rings and a side of coleslaw  the chipotle aioli tasted more like thousand island dressing  on to the shrimp tacos  anyone who has had baja style shrimp tacos knows that they are breaded in fairness to sta barbara shellfish co the menu did not state they would be breaded  according to my husband they were just awright  from my vantage point across the table his plate did not look appetizing  a side of box quality spanish rice to complement the tacos  the best thing about this place  getting the heck outoverall never coming backi love cupcakes ok maybe i kind of freak out over them but i was expecting to have a great experience at batch because lets face it places that specialize in cupcakes tend to specialize in them for a reason upon entering the store and seeing the beautifully presented selection of organic paleo and vegan cupcakes i was convinced that i was about to have my socks rocked off well presentation isnt everything  at 3 a cupcake i was expecting to eat a rich flavorful moist cupcake instead my husband and i agreed that they were bland unbalanced and a little drycrumbly i was as any 7 month pregnant woman allowing herself a treat would be pretty disappointed the cupcakes we ate were their flagship vanilla cupcake and their lemon cupcake the lemon cupcake was not even slightly tart it tasted of slightly bitter lemon rind and lots of sugar there was no tartness or even the slightest bit of salt to balance the flavors the vanilla cupcake had no pleasant vanilla aroma i would say it tasted like pure sugar   they present a beautiful appearing product but unfortunately the flavor is not up to par i would prefer my own 30 minute betty crocker vanilla cupcakes and homemade buttercream frosting to the batch cupcakes any day  if they change their recipes i would be happy to try them again cupcake fiend that i ami got the falafel sandwich to go   firstly falafel tastes great only if made fresh the gentleman making the falafel took it straight out the freezer and tossed it in the deep fryer i had an impression that this might not taste that good after all  secondly he did not wrap the sandwich properly before he put it in the brown bag when i took the sandwich out to eat a quarter of the portion had already said hello to the bottom of the brown bag  the sandwich was really dry and tasteless i was lamenting my choice to go to kalamatas i could have made a better sandwich in under 3 minutes had i had some pita and frozen falafels  i would rather goto the subway next doorworst chipolte i have ever been to they served me a taco with  undercooked bloody chicken along with an employees curly black hair absolutely disgusting they gave me my money back only after i demanded it and were not very apologetic i suggested they wear hairnets to cover their nastyness and prevent this and was told all they have to wear is hats go to any other locationwe drove about 5 miles from the interstate into this subway location in maryville il just to receive one of the worst service i have ever had the second we walked in the girl behind the counter greeted us with the driest unenthusiastic welcome ever as dry as the sahara desert next the same girl started to ask our orders as we started to make our orders she kept walking back and forth into the back room trying to get other stuff and almost like we are such an inconvenience for her lastly when she started to put my daughters sub together she just slapped everything on a sub and flung that sub on a toaster tray that made everything on it spill everywhere and thats when i said something  she gave me a look and never apologized for her demeanor i wish i can give no star for this location because it is not worth it if you are looking for a subway location in the troymaryville location  never go to this locationthis was one of the worst restaurant experiences we have had we ordered the chicken bahn asked for extra sauce twice got pathetic looking sandwiches filled mostly with cilantro and no sauce couldnt swallow even half also ordered vegetarian rolls which came with some type of spam like substance in it and the sauce was some kind of smelly brown chunky gel the staff could care less about customer service or quality in looking around as our son finished his pho which he says was ok we realized how truly filthy everything was we already had wiped off our own table before sitting down we went to several tables first finding them all dirty consequently we watched one of the staff lay food down without wiping the table first forcing the patrons to eat in someone elses mess it looked like a daycare had gone through the place leaving slobber and who knows what on the walls and glass of the food prep area  not sure what friends they paid to write good reviews heres hoping we didnt get food poisoningwell i have been visiting arners for many years but had been out of state for a few years now  their salad bar was one to come visit with their homemade bread with whipped butter that you slice yourself  nope none  some you can get anywhere rolls were in their place  salad bar was ok  now let us talk desserts  i love lemon meringue pie   big piece of pie but the filling if homemade they need to fire the baker omg  lumpy lemon pie  new owners dont know  is this why we did not wait in a long line which was par the course for this restaurantthey only had one person behind the counter and the service was horrible  i waited in line 20 minutes for pasta and when i got to the counter he told me they were out of pasta  there had to be at least 15 people behind me  decided to go next door to burger king got my food with in minutes or lessi love pulp fiction i love the music i love the text i love the flashbacksso whats the link with the foodery i hear you saywell this is a robbery  now you get it  am sorry but the selection might be as obscure as it gets i am not paying such money again for 2 bottlesthe dame blanche was not even that tasty  the staff was just plain rude no greetings no thanks just my cashthanks but no thanks  my only spot now is bella vista beer and i am telling you their choice is just as good as the robbery i beg your pardon the fooderyawful this is the absolute worst baskin robbins i have ever been to they are the slowest moving people waited in line for 15 minutes for ice cream with 4 people working behind the counter moving slow as molasses if you want to leave with a horrible customer experience this is the place for you not to mention the staff isnt friendly and the place is dirty this baskin robbins definitely taints the good name of the companynow im from new orleans but this mcdonalds im good try to get my lady a vanilla ice cream cone and ask can you put caramel on the vanilla they said no we dont do that we just order a caramel sundae and when we get to the 2nd window to pick it up we ask hey can we get just a cone so we can put the caramel ice cream on it i figure yeah why not or maybe 50 cents but they wanted to charge us a 111 just for it i was speechless and to see somebody i went to high school with me some 14 years ago serving me a sundae i was just lost for words i will just take my chances at another micky dswent there expecting a good breakfast what i got was 15 minutes of waiting to put in an order and then another 20 minutes of waiting for our food that never came i understand that they were busy which is why we stayed there as long as we did when we saw a couple that sat down after us get served before us we told a manager that we were leaving she went on to explain that certain dishes come from a side of the kitchen that is busier than the the other side where sandwiches and soups come from i get that but when a people that come in after us and get served before us i feel like there is something wrong in conclusion the juice was good but the experience suckedif i could give no stars i would 56 minutes of an order and then questioned on why i wanted my fucking money back 2nd time here in 6 months and both times horrible management dont take order when youre an hour behindon the 6th of february we had made arrangements a week prior to have lunch with our family after a funeral of our father  when we arrived there were only 2 servers waiting on tables  we sat there for over 30 minutes before our orders for drinks were taken  we had 20 people there to have a lunch needless to say this place was not prepared  the bottom line is that the food took an hour to prepare and the food was not that good  i asked to speak to a manager and there was none  the service was so bad that i had to go to the bar and serve the drinks to the family  the waiters were also the bartenders at 19 years of age  we were all disappointed in the service  organization lack of caring and most of all the owner for running a business without being available for a large groups none of us will ever go there again samwhat drew me here promise of a korean bbq taco what will keep me from going here again tasteless waaaaay overpriced foodto start the floors were nasty then ordering things were left off my order after getting a cup with an empty dining area the drink machine is out of ice took over 25 minutes before order was ready all that said never going backnot a smile the whole time mostly for asian tourists must be in some guide book food was not fillingi mean love the space but i like to be able to see a little bit and whats the smell for real that is for sure sewage more light less poopy smelland dont bother to complain to corporateyou receive a standard thank you for your feedback letter and nothing improves at this locationok place for coffee but over priced for lunch or dinner  you order at the front counter similar to a fast food place  ordered their ipa but they were out so had their amber ale  the wait staff needs some additional training started out with 12 of the class foam they finally got it to 14 foam and handed me the glass and a number so they could find me to send my food out  my friends meal was served almost 3 min before mine totally not cool  fast food service with fine dinning prices2 weeks ago i went into sugar rush to schedule a cake to be made for my wedding 6 months ago i gave the owner and the worker my wedding date and was told its peak season but we should be able to do it lets schedule in a couple weeks for you to come back to get everything finalized so i show up early with 3 other family members to have a amazing wedding experience we get there walk inside and she had us sit at a table she comes back over completely rushed with her cell phone on the table immediately she asks for my wedding date which i will remind you we already gave to her 2 weeks prior i give it to her and get a blank stare i believe im already booked out now i live 55 miles away from this place so i was aggravated and so upset then i get a response well we could try this is the biggest day of my live and you are telling me you will try oh and to add to all of this when she walked away her cell phone had gone off and she was upset at me that i did not tell her that her phone went off because she was having a family emergency after all of this we left and would never go backthe bacon was as rubbery as reed richards tasted as if it had been cooked in an old microwavewe heard they had the best tacos in town they were very mediocre ordered refried beans and rice the beans were just okay and the rice was cold and hard they only brought out one meal there were 2 of us and did bring our other meal out fairly quickly but still forgot an item we had ordered very disappointedavoid this place unless you have a few hours to waste and you dont plan on eating  there was no hostess to seat us  we and other guests just stood around looking for a table  when a table finally opened we sat down  the table was filthy so i cleaned it the best i could with the napkins available at the table  we waited 25 minutes for a waitress to even come to our table which we had to share with 4 strangers  my companion went to the front to ask if we were to order at the register or was there wait staff  another 10 minutes passed and a disheveled waitress finally appeared  she did not bring a cloth to wipe the table but was quick to grab her tip from the previous guests  when we tried to order we were told they were out of bread so we couldnt order any sandwiches which terribly disappointed me as i was craving a pastrami on rye sandwich  we rechose items from the menu which didnt require bread and proceeded to wait another 45 minutes but still hadnt gotten any food  in all that time the waitress never came back to give us a status on our order  wed had enough by then and just paid for our sodas and left  absolutely terrible service  nearly 2 hours wasted from my day and i didnt even get to eat  skip this place if you value your time and want to eati called this place asking for their hours and was met quite rudely by a woman  who answered the phone  giving the benefit of the doubt i decided to try their bbq anyway  once i arrived my order was taken by a woman who seemed friendly and by the sounds of it was the same woman i spoke with on the phone  i thought ahh one off thing  i ordered ribs and brisket the same i compare to all bbq places  the ribs were dry but had some flavour to it but i did not want dry ribs  when i tried the brisket i had never tried brisket that was this dry in my life  their bbq sauce is what saved everything and made it palpable to eat the highlight of this was their corn bread and beans not the best ive had but it was definitely good   after much debate i decided to try this place again a few weeks later  sadly nothing about the food has  changed  ive been to many bbq houses that ive never once had a hit n miss let alone two misses  sad to say i do not foresee this business surviving once another comparable business arrivesthis is by far the worst kfc or taco bell ive ever been to  every time we go its something else  they were once out of fried chicken yes  kfc was out of fried chicken  another time the power went out for a few hours and they lost all their food and were closed for a week all the surrounding fast food restaurants reopened the same day  guess that 10k backup power generator is sounding pretty good after losing 5 days of sales  their latest shenanigans is that they dont accept citi visa cards  they said they always show up as card not accepted on their pos machine  i asked if the management was aware of this  yes  are they working on fixing it  no its just those card thats right kids just the 1 credit card issuer and credit card processor in the us  no big deal  this place also used to have monitors facing the customers with wait times  theyve since turned them around and covered them up since they were so embarrassingly slow  theyd literally all be 500 seconds  then they systematically keep receipts rather than give them to the customers so you cant fill out negative surveys  i never ask for my receipt as i assume ill get it with my order but they systematically remove them from the tray  i saw a whole stack of hundreds of receipts under the cash register  i think the employees are told they have to turn them all in at the end of the night since the managerowner knows if you give them to customers they will fill out bad feedback   we usually come in the evening when the dining room is empty  there usually isnt anyone at the cash register  ive waited 5 minutes just to have someone come and take and order and 10 minutes for the food on top of that  15 minutes when they arent even busy  the employees here are always on their phones and cutting up while you are standing their waiting at the cash register just for someone to acknowledge your presence  the employees are not friendly and downright rude  do you have taco bell kids meals  blank stare literally nothing  about the third time asking they get all sassy and say no  way to be kid friendly in the most suburban area of carmel  then on multiple occurrences when paying with a kfc gift card that the strip doesnt work theyve told me the card isnt accepted  the first time this happened after arguing with sassy mcfrassy that its a gift card so there is no such thing as it not being accepted and explaining to him the magnetic strip may not work and he may have to manually type it in he finally agrees to type it in and proceeds to type it in wrong literally 4 times in a row each time getting sassier and saying my card is not being accepted  finally a manager comes over and types it in and it works which you would think he would at least acknowledge he was wrong  nope  then since they dont have a taco bell kids meal cheese roll we ordered a quesadilla which was spicy and my daughter didnt like it who puts anything other than cheese in a quesadilla  so i go back to order some 079 nachos  sassy mcfassy gets the card right this time and rather than turning around and grabbing the nachos sitting under the heat lamp and squirting some cheese in a cup proceeds to walk off  literally no one filled the order for 10 minutes for just a bag of chips and cheese sauce  during this entire time there was no one at the register and no one even looked up from messing around in the back to see someone was obviously waiting for an order  this experience is just a typical experience for this place  avoid this place like the plaguethis is the 3rd time i have visited this location all three times after 8pm and the service was terrible along with running out of food the burrito  was made very sloppy and the employees act like they dont want to be there i hope management does some spot checks and corrects the issue otherwise they will continue to lose customershigh prices for what it is i got a chicken salad and it was terrible soaked in dressing with some gross dark meat chicken on it also got a pita that was very mediocre and also drenched in salty sauce wont be backconsitantly awful the staff is unprofessional rude and let you know they dont care about their job or serving you the second you walk in the door my call in orders magically disappear when i get to the store once i get for my smoothie its watery and gross everything about this franchise from management to employees is such a joke if your in the mood for tropical smoothie try the 66th street location i will be driving 30 mins out of my way to avoid this mess of a storeworst cheesesteak ever  seriously greasy gross bad 13 for peppers and provolone on a tiny sandwich    in this case i was glad it was small bigger would have meant more mashed meat and grease     if you like their oregon ave steak do yourself a favor and skip coming here  save your calories for chinks i mean joes or eat the wings and pizza at the bowling alley   also when the manager came out they could have made it right but didnt they actually saw us throw it into the trash after a long speil about how sorry they were about the quality  so thanks for nothing corporate tonyim basing this review off of poor customer service i called to try to place an order so i dont have to wait on my order obviouslyno answer i get to the place i see a worker on his cell phone i get acknowledged but it took a few minutes to even get waited on so as im waiting to place my order im hearing the phone ring several times no one answering and the guy still on his cellphone while the phone is ringing theres got to be atleast 5 other pizza places in this area next time i will choose another i hope the right person sees this and the guy is still on his cellphone smhhorrible horrible service i took friends who were in town to this place because theyd heard about it and wanted to go my last visit several years ago was terrible but i wanted to make the friends happy so we went  as usual terrible service and the place was sweltering it was warm and when asked a few times if the air could be turned on we were ignored they did not refill drinks the food was lukewarm and it also took 10 minutes to get our drinks and close to 30 minutes to get our food  which again was lukewarm  there apparently was no manager to complain to and the server acted as if we were being a pain in the butt the entire time we were there   i do not plan on going back no matter who asks me to take them after we left one of my friends said i see why you wanted to take us to cheeburger i bet their service would have been loads better wowthis was awful a friend recommended the place on our way to a concert maybe i got the wrong food but the hot dog i half consumed seemed undercooked and pricey   needless to say i would not recommendas of 10142014 this location is closed  words to make this review long enough  im sure the service was awesome and so fast you would freak but i guess i will never knowdisappointing my husband and i  went here for the first time today for lunch around 140 we ordered our food and drinks at the bar the bartender who took our order said our drinks will be delivered to our table shortly i ordered a veggie burger and my husband ordered the caprese paninisince they ran out of pork for the havana my husband and i proceeded to sit outside but there were many unbussed dirty tables so we werent  sure which tables were available we waited for our food for 20 min meanwhile never receiving our drinks when the server delivered our food we asked for our drinks and told him which drinks we ordered he delivered a can of coke and a can of coconut water with one glass of ice and asked which one of us wanted the glass with iceinstead of bringing two glasses with ice what a joke the silverware was wrapped in a dirty napkin with crumbs inside yuck our food was decent veggie burger tasted like garlic no other outstanding flavors and was accompanied with a grape walnut and bleu cheese crumbles salad  my husbands caprese panini was decentnothing outstanding here either so long story short the food wasnt great enough to dismiss the horrible service and the dirty atmosphere which by the time we left the tables around us were still not bussed and there were new customer sitting at them so im disappointed with the service cleanliness and the staff not worth going to this restaurantordered the dylan the blandest pizza i have ever tasted   ordered the feta cheese sticks the same only thing good was the delivery guy was good looking first and last timepurchased a chicken burrito at about 830pm 82516  they were out of chicken so had to wait for a few minutes which is no big deal  however the chicken was very undercooked raw in the middle  called the location to let them knowmy husband and i were looking forward to some good bagels were originally from ny my husband ordered a scooped out sesame bagel with cream cheesenothing crazy right well not according to the owner he was so rude have you ever seen the episode on seinfeld with the soup nazi he was the scooped bagel nazi he went off on my husband on how they dont scoop bagels and not in a nice way my husband offered to do it himself the owner still said no what a jerk  needless to say we left dont bother giving these people your money not only are they rude but their bagels didnt look like they were good anyway their choice of cream cheese toppings didnt look like anything special eithermy family and i ate there saturday 81812 around 430 pm its a shame that a lot of the house rolls are fried as americans we take a normally healthy food and deep fry it and make it unhealthy i realize why asianamerican fusion restaurants are doing this  to open up the sushi market to those that would otherwise be turned off by the raw fish idea this is a trend across america so i cannot slight them for this  however i didnt feel the descriptions were clear as we ended up with deep fried rolls thinking they would be uncooked  this was in all likelihood our mistake as fried  tempura were in many of the descriptions our big problem was approximately 56 hours after having dinner my wife got ill i will not go into the specifics but needless to say  we are certain it was the sushi she ate at ru sans with that said  the others in our party were fine  we did not share the food i dont make this accusation lightly as i know it can harm the business but after much thought we felt it needed to be posted this may be an isolated incident  i certainly hope so needless to say  we will not returnwell well well i thought i would visit this location with a friend since it was the closest one to his house mind you i was first introduced to this wonder of fresh food in portland or in 2005  first this location claims that a traditional quesarito is no longer free typically when ordering a quesarito they put some cheese on the tortilla prior to steaming it and while it steams you order your free double rice with free double beans and other momentous fresh goodies along with more cheese if so desired all at the price of a regular burrito the young man informed me that this is no longer the case you now only get a choice of melted cheese or not they do not provide both any more i have one word to describe this cheap  i have a suspicion that they are going cheap on their customers at this location since i have since tested this and found it false at other locations in the valley perhaps someone should tell everyone else or chipotle at the village stop being so cheap and offer their amazing secret items i would not visit this location if like me you enjoy consistency with your service if you have been unfamiliar with these things in previous visits at least you can get your cheese melted  one last thing ask for boneless chicken mine was notewww perhaps they have down graded their meat quality as wellordered a pizza here and when received it looked as if the toppings were thrown on as the pizza was throne in the box the taste was no better save your money and your taste buds order somewhere elsei used to like this place but just had breakfast there and was disgusted by the number of health code violations i witnessed while forced to watch the kitchen from my table how do you feel about having the cook eat while hes cooking your food and moves his hand from his mouth to  your food thought id complained to the manager who was expediting but she had toast propped on her bosom touching her tshirt my decision is not to eat there againwe went there thinking this food would be good but it was the most lousy meal we ever had and we will not be back the salad bar was very plain with just a few choices the meals were greasy and the shepards pie tasted like it came out of a dog food can the service was very slow and the manager is never there my advice is find a better place to eat not this placeprices on canned goods such as tuttorossa crushed tomatoes goya kidney beans etc are more expensive here than at shoprite or superfresh cant do pantry bulk stock up like with shoprites cancan sale    produce selection is horrible with sticky containers of berries dirty garlic and a poor selection of lettuce offering only dole prepackaged mixes no arugula ever either never any good mushrooms eitherthis location is terrible order from any other location if you can the last 3 times i ordered my pizza was delivered at least an hour past when it said it was supposed to be delivered this past time when i called to check on it i was told i dont deal with the delivery end of things i had to wait 15 minutes on hold just to find out the status of my already 15hour late order seriouslyany other location is better than this onethey have a great beer selection but they lack on customer service i have gone here a few times over the years and was not always pleased with the staff but  my last visit was the straw that broke the camels back i had a terrible experience at this place i went in to get a lottery ticket and paid with cash after the women handed me my ticket she never gave me my money when i informed her that she still owed me she proceeded to tell me she did give me my change and i must have hidden it somewhere when i told her again after emptying my pockets she came from behind the counter and frisked me and said that i must have hidden it under my cloths still not wanting to give me my money she opened the draw handed me my change in coins and said i was a thief and told me never to come back again i have never had an experience like this before dont go hear unless you want to be demoralized and attacked when buying a product from themdo not order from hooters via grubhub  i made that mistake spending about 60 total  my order was completely screwed up  breaded wings instead of naked cheesecake placed on top of hot food so was meltedmushy a mysterious order of mozzarella cheese sticks that i did not order  without any marina or anything to dip them in   in addition wings were swimming in grease  they use cheese sauce which is nasty there is no real cheese on anything on tots and in sauce for pretzels etc   just not  never againi was very unhappy with my last stay at hard rock council oaks should be ashamed of the lack of several entrees and bread seriously offered a loaf to take home but we were staying there and after a late night to hear a jackhammer over our ceiling at 8am  but went back with out of town relatives having a good time i was the designated driver only to be approached by steve and told to leave the premises leaving quietly i again asked to speak to steve againwho showed up with uniformed police officers 5 of them  we left quietly but will not go back there again  everthis place was such a huge disappointment ive been wanting to go because it looks nice and its a cute place that is until you walk in and realize that they serve the coffee in paper cups and the food on plastic plates with plastic knives and forks plus the coffee came out luke warm   then on top of that the service was terrible there were 6 of us and they brought the food out about 1015 mins apart those of us who had food tried to wait but then our food was getting cold so we started eating and we were about halfway done by the time the last plate came out   then they just got a lot of little things wrong one of us got scrambled eggs instead of fried we had to ask for them to bring something to put on the toast like butter or jam and that took forever we ordered glasses of water that never came the pancakes were good but the eggs with toast was just very ordinary the toast was soggy how do you mess up breakfast or just toast for that matter   im never going back hereok went back tonight for take out  first the good the sausage and lentil soup was delicious and the curb side waitress was adorable  thats it  the bad  pollo las calla the chicken was barely cooked through the sauce was tasteless they were out of mashed potatoes so i got the side with a name i cant pronounce it sounds something like americano anyway it was corkscrew pasta with a spoonful of tomato chunks stirred in totally dry and bland  my son ordered the pasta weezie  i just asked him how it was and he said he couldnt eat it because there was such a small amount of sauce it was like eating plain noodles  we now have two containers of plain noodles sitting on our counter so all in all 40 for chicken and plain noodles  oh and the bread was hardso hard it was i edible    is anyone from this restaurant even reading these commentswell we were planning on eating here on saturday night but after being seated for a good 20 minutes with no acknowledgement from anyone we left horrible service even a quick check in from a server would have been appreciated guess what no one noticed we were leaving either no surprise there its saturday youre busy but its also saturday and youre an established restaurant who should know how to properly staff and serve guestswe have been to this restaurant on multiple occasions i have given it an honest try but each and every time they get the order wrong or items are missing they make you pull to the front and wait for your food which would be awesome if they got the order correctly since theyre supposedly making our food while we wait 20 minutes or more sometimes im done will not go back to this burger king waste of moneyliterally just sat in line for 45 mins in the drive threw thats not an exaggeration when reaching the window no apologies just handed food when i went to check our order out of fear of sitting in line again looking back at the line of cars the girl seemed irritated that i looked to my not surprise i found out why of the 7 items ordered only 3 were right one bag we were handed was in fact probably someone elses as it was nowhere near our order no apologies were made for our missing items only attitude given waited another 10 mins just to get our food thinking it would be right this time but no again we were missing an item that was specifically asked for to be remembered at that point closing in on a hour it was not worth driving back and waiting in line the worst experience ive had here i maybe would have given more stars if the blonde girl working the counter who happened to not return my receipt today at 630 would have been sympathetic but no she treated us like we werent a concernafter several trips to the fresh market i feel the need to write a review on my experiences on more than two occasions i stood at the deli counter ignored by the staff that were busy cleaning trays preparing salads etc it appeared every staff member had a job to do which didnt include serving the customer one time i had to get the manager to get service today takes the cake my husband was at the check out and he questioned the total the cashier repliedthat is what it is my husband replied how much is the chicken she gave him the price of 19 thats impossible the banter went back  forth she tore off the receipt and shoved it in his face my husbands choice of words after that could have been better chosen but she was flat out rude my husband reported the experience to the manager who said he would take care of iti have eaten at many cracker barrels all around this country and this by far was the worst service other that our waitress and food i have ever had the displeasure of visiting and eating at where to start oh thats right there was nowhere to start because everything was bad for starters although in some countries eating hair may be a delicacy but be rest assured its not in the usa the biscuits were hard and overcooked the hash browns were undercooked and mushy and their was a hair in my mothers eggs honestly i could understand the hair thing because i have long hair and it sometime has a mind of its own but the entire meal was not cooked right and that is why i felt it was necessary to post a review i have been there during the day and didnt have a problem but the night crew was deplorablei thought so highly of this place after my visit food was good atmosphere was nicei dont know what happened but everything went downhill love the concept but b good is inconsistent the place is dirty and the staff always seems to be miserable the food is good but grossly overpriced and honestly not worth it the slogan is good food fast but a turtle could deliver a finer dish faster  i dont usually give places second chances especially after finding a metal nut mixed in with my sweet potato fries yes this happened here and all they said was sorry but i was hoping b good would win me back  sad to say they only got worse  i will no longer b gooddisappointed tonight  sat at the bar for 5 minutes  no service  no one said a word to me  no verbal acknowledgement  walked out gave my business elsewhereordered take out lasagna was half the size as dine it was refrigerator cold not even room temperature tasted old after i had to cook my take out 30 minutes after the rest of my family ate dont go theregood luck getting an entertainment platter i just had a horrible experience ive shopped there and its been pretty good selectionwise prices are high   long story short i was transferred 5 times all i wanted to know is whats on the entertainment platter and whats the cost on the 5th transfer i went to customer service for help with their website i was fiddling on the computer while i waited and found the entertainment platter icon  you guessed it the link had a message saying theres no brochure available   so i got back to customer service told him what happened told him he lost a customer and received the following reply ahh as in whatever and he hung up i called back talked to the store manager i never talk to store managers to complain did i get anywhere with her nope i couldnt have sold her a clue and omg then i looked at the other reviews almost all 1 and 2 stars youd think theyd get a clue never going backthis place only receives 1 star because i have to give it a star in order to rate the location this is one of the worst wendys ever i frequent wendys all of the time because i love their salad however i couldnt even purchased my food because the attitude of one of the cashiers she was so rude i refused to give them my business i called the 800 customer service number and then promptly left to find another wendys not to mention there were two bugs on the floor  bewarethe worst meal ive had ever the green beans were total mush definitely canned the chicken was extremely salty and the bbq sauce was awful i cannot believe how much money i wasted on this poor excuse for food dont eat here try the jamaican jerk place a block away insteadi was in the area and in a hurry so i stopped in only to see it wasnt pennies bbq anymore it will be the last time i stop in the 18oz pork steak that used to cost about 999 was 1799wow i am embarrassed to say i paid that price when i got back to my office what they call bbq was amazing it was the toughest driest pork steak i have ever eaten never again will i make that mistakewell this place sucks they have nice plants and nice decor but they served there food as if a grown ass man wouldnt notice that the bread wasnt something i could buy at krogers the food was something you serve to drunk people i couldnt even afford their beer enough to get drunk village pub is more like pillage and run not worth it just go to taco bell and grab a tall boy at speedwayyoull be happy ya didwish i could rate the food but the place that is supposed to be open until 11pm decided to close at 10pm coming from a retail store manager there is actually a chance at making some good money in the last hour especially in bellevue when everything but krystal closes at 10pmhad expectations for a fresh meal based on menu choices and advertising in the restaurant the whole wheat roll for my chicken sandwich was both stale and rubbery at the same time go figure sweet potato fries clearly had been rewarmed my friends salad was less pathetic but nothing special this place is selling itself as fresh healthy and from the farm yucktoday i was very disappointed  im allergic to avocado i order 4 street tacos without avocado they al had avocado the worst part the fries were old the guy in the drive threw kept yawning an blowing his dragon breath as he gave me the order pretty gross  im not coming here for lunch anymore thanks for the loss of appetiteid read some glowing reviews of hendricks so a coworker and i went to lunch last week  place is certainly good sized and recently rebuilt from the previous maryland yards restaurant  i ordered the pic 2 with ribs and brisket got sides of green beans and cole slaw  buddy got the pic 3  the food was reasonably good problems were with a premium pricesthose two meals with no drinks or other add ons were 46 and b portionsthe sides are served in probably two oz portions looks like theyre served in condiment cups and the meat portions were equally disappointing  i got about a 4 oz piece of ribs and at most a couple of oz of brisket  if im going to pay 18 for a barbeque dinner i dont expect to eat it and still be hungry  especially with the new brazilian tucanos opening nearby with all you can eat for about the same price as my less than ample lunch i see no reason to spend any more money here6918 i went to this restaurant for the very first time i was in the mood for a calzone called ahead and ordered one to go i picked it up and starving as i was i began to pick at it in the car the taste was funny i pulled another piece off and it tasted odd also i then looked at the calzone itself and thats when i noticed it was not cooked completely the bread itself was doughy on one side i tore another piece off and stretched out it with my fingers horrified i turned the car around and spoke with the pic and was a given a refund i will never go back to this place againthis kfc taco bell is horrible  food was cold and not everything on menu is present in store customer service was ok but biscuit and chicken was cold and chalupa was warm at best and this was during lunch hour place was not busy very disappointedi am writing this as im leaving this teavana  i just had the worst experience with this salesman honestly  im so appaled  i had to write on this now   i walked in and explained i was looking for tea for a lady who im staying with as a thankyou gift i should have caught this pushy dudes name  he instantly introduced the most expensive tea  2200 for 2 oz they smelled great  but with myself and my band going out of town on touri was balling on a budget as i politely explained i told him that i wanted to work with 10 each  his attitude completely changed  he grabbed the mandarin for 780 i believe  i wanted to get two but just couldnt justify two teas plus the tins at 7 a pop which he insisted i get  for almost 40 no thank you  as he rang me up and bagged my tea i said thank youhe shoved the bag across the counter and said yep  then went to mess around with his buddies at the entrance   having worked in retail for most of my adult life matter fact i am a former employee of intimacy in the same mall i know that selling products takes a little craft but it doesnt take being rude forcing the most expensive product down your throat first and then scoffing when your customer states they cant afford it and practically pushing them out of the store its a shame  the teas awesome but if all employees are like this  ill be making my purchases onlinei really wanted to like this place ive tried it many times but im just going to give up every time i go theyre out of something no matter what time i come in dont know what they have take forever to make my fooddrink and the food is bland and not good  last time i went i got a peanut butter banana smoothy i asked if they had skim milk and the girl working said yes is 2 ok no its not ok thats why i asked for skim she then told me they also had yogurt i asked if it was fat free she said no but the other girl working said yes then another woman working told me they never carry skim milk but that they have soy milk they make themselves but then the other girls told me they were out i just gave up and told them to make it however they normally do    it was the most watery flavorless smoothy ive ever had it just tasted like watery milk a complete waste of 4 i gave this place so many chances but it always let me down i wont be returningwe were very disappointed with the decorated birthday cake we ordered the decoration was way below average a simple soccer ball that was unrecognizable as such and while the cake was fresh its flavor was average at best the facility itself was cluttered and not very clean sticky tables ugh the young clerks working there when we picked up the cake didnt even know how to fold and put together the cake box although they were very polite and definitely trying to do their best wed probably have gotten a better product at walmart or costco but wanted to support a local business very disappointing and not recommendedthis mcdonalds doesnt honor the any drink for 1 on its unsweet tea which is undoubtedly cheaper than soda to make stop at the circle k across the street any polar pop tea or soda 079service and food are on standards here at this mcdonalds but there is nothing special about this one the last time i was hear they messed up everything dont go hereweve ordered from queen sushi since we were college kids 12 years ago and the food has always been decent especially compared to competition in the area when we moved to a new house we werent sure if they delivered and tried new places but recieved a menu from them as a mailing and happily resumed ordering through them   however today when we tried to place our order like we usually do once every week or two we were informed that we were too far for delivery  that is pretty strange and frustrating considering were 10 minutes away they sent us a menu  and we order for delivery all the time without issue  next when i expressed confusion the statement was changed to youre too far for delivery to its a 30 minimum our order is pretty consistently around 18  as the conversation continued the minimum was changed magically to 25 next she had to check with the driver to see if they felt like it  they apparently did not  a company absolutely has the right to dictate delivery radius and minimum delivery amounts their menu states fast delivery min 1000 the inconsistency is ridiculous which prompted this reviewfood looked good but never made it past the front door they were so rude and cocky at the front door that i never even sat down to eat these guys are not the only place to get food on the wharf dont bother going here unless you like being treated like crapi have always been a big fan of dairy queen i have visited this location several times they offer ice cream at the drive thru for dogs i recently ordered a cake online through them it was ordered a week in advance and even received a confirmation email for my order when we went to pick up the ordered cake for my sons 15th birthday we were told that it was no longer an option and they were not making it any more i didnt get an email or a phone call to let me know the order couldnt be placed this was a big disappointment since we had no cake for my sons party the young girls at the counter called the manager or owner whoever it was  they were instructed to give us 25 off a cake from their selection of cakes in the freezer big disappointment bad customer service and not a care in the world to ruin a party because of their neglect  we will never give them out support againthis is my second time here the first time i had the lamb kabob bowl i wasnt impressed the first time but decided to give it another try since i was really hungry and wanted a quick bite today i ordered the chicken kabob dooner the chicken was dry and flavorless i do not recommend this placenever going back food was mediocre good chips and salsa service was poor not enough people working for the amount of tables seated told half off margaritas were the drink special we had a coupon that we had showed them before ordering that kids meals were free monday nights  coupon didnt say only 1 free kids meal per table it said per entree went to pay for the ticket and they told us we could have the half off drinks or use the coupon and charged us for an additional kids meal talked to the owner and he didnt seem to care at all told us we should have brought an extra coupon absolutely ridiculous dont go back on what you said and be willing to work with your customerspretty bad experience i would take taxo bell over sweet taco anyday their food selection sounds good but the quality and taste is just horrible i ordered guac and its just plain avocado with no seasoning at all i would not recommand this place at allone of the worst buffet we have ever eaten went on sunday afternoon the vegetarian choices were terrible food was coldthe dessert was bad too paid 12 for cabbage broccoli and toor daal naan was served after we were almost done eating very disappointed the place looked nice and clean so one starinconsistent slow service long lines long wait times under staffed all of these are mentioned in most of the reviews the answer to that is management and training good management take the lead lead the team and set the pace this place is chaotic no one takes charge in a managerial way often times staff on duty is high on pot owner take note ill spend my money where i get good service from well trained polite and sober staffi have friends who live close to this store and they told me it was worth a trip i usually shop at total wine staff was very friendly i guess im spoiled from shopping at total wine because the selection of wine liquor and beer couldnt even come close to tws selection the prices were definitely higher than tws as well they were happy to look up many of the items that i usually buy at tw but didnt have most of them even though they told me they have the same distributor the few that they did have were much higher than tw for the same exact item if youre paying cash and need a receipt make sure to ask for one they dont give one and dont even offer you one kind of odd i had to become a member of their club in order receive the sale or club price on a few items wasnt impressed and wont ever go back dont waste your time  ill stick to total wineworst place ever i order some tacos and my husband order some muscles calamari and more the food was take out and once we get home i saw the tacos it only had one shirmp per taco i reach to the manager who was extreanly rude i reach to the general manager its been 1 month and nothing  i am a manager for a local hotel on state street i will not recommend this restaurant to any of my guestasked for an order of 12 hot wings then ask for half to be honey gold then told that it would be and extra charge then told that manager just informed her that it could not be done extremely curt and offered no suggestions on how i could receive what i wanted dont think that i will return you probably dont care because youre kfc yet with your extensive menu and if you have ingredients in house then how do you tell a guest noi love ljs fish  its been ages since having some so yesterday evening we went here despite the reviews we went with eyes wide open knowing the service would suck it did food was good but waiting in line was forever as cashier cut up with employees  customers ahead of us who were apparently family as we noted they didnt have to pay very muchfinally a manager came up from the back  told dude to just clock out  leave if he was just going to cut up he did as i said food was goodwhen we finally got it table  booth were almost adhesive with old grease though nasty health inspection was noted to be a 98 but with the lack of cleanliness i cant imagine how next time ill wait forever but get it to gomy family and i were spending the day walking around the french quarter and i found the fidgety on google maps i was so excited to check it out because we all are big ice cream fans and i personally have a sweet tooth the size of texas however the service was terrible the milkshakes were pretty expensive there were no seats which my family was needing and my parents found the staff to be insulting   my family arrived at the shop at a good time making us first in line however by the time the staff made our order of two milkshakes and an ice cream cone there were 20 people in line there were five people working but only one woman was taking orders and preparing ice cream the rest of the staff appeared to be completely oblivious that there were customers waiting which started to greatly upset some of the parents with young children there was no sense of a line so people were being helped out of order and the staff was rude about it after making a milkshake for me one staff member asked wha my brother wanted who also ordered a milkshake and snapped at him complaining that he should have informed her before she made my milkshake although she gave him no time to do so   additionally when i inquired about gluten in certain milkshakes the staff members had no idea what i was referring to telling me i should not order anything in the store because there was dairy cream and sugar all up in the milkshakes even when i explained what gluten was and that i was not referring to dairy the staff was unable to identify what milkshakes had gluten and seemed to get an attitude that really upset my parents ultimately my dad ended up not ordering anything at all because the staff gave my brother and i such a hard time he felt like ordering was an inconvenience on the staff and thus did not want to pay them any more money than we already were   all in all my family found that the fidgety was not worth the money or the wait at all since our two milkshakes and one ice cream cone cost just over 20 the allergen risk was too high and the disrespect and disregard to customers was so surprising i hope it was just a fluke and that maybe we caught the staff at a bad time however if you do have any allergies if you have young children that maybe do not want to wait 40 minutes unnecessarily for a milkshake or if you are simply interested in better service i would recommend going elsewhere for a sweet treatmy husband and i are regular customers here we always order the same thing for every visit salty almond chocolate and creole cream cheese we also always tip a dollar to our cashier but this time i didnt want to tip our cashier anything because the scoops she gave us was very very tiny when we sat down to eat our ice cream ive noticed that my creole cream cheese ice cream was very sour we informed our cashier about it and she offered to change it with a different flavor i am not a big fan of the other flavors they have because all of them are super sweet so i told her it is ok no big deal i didnt eat or finish my ice cream after that for fearing of getting diarrhea or food poisoning later i really think that the milk or cream cheese used in that particular batch probably expired already for it to be that sour yuck i just left the ice cream on my table later on ive decided to get a new one in my husbands favorite flavor instead of wasting my money our cashier was willing to get us a new one but the look on her face was filled with attitude no smile no apologies no nothing later she came to our table and handed us the ice cream i didnt look at her face but my husband said that she looked at us in disgust like we are one of those people who make up a million excuses to complain and get free complimentary stuff we are regular customers here and never return back any item purchased just this one visit my ice cream tasted super sour and rotten thats it i really love the creole cream cheese ice cream here it is one of my favorites of all time but i dont think i will come back due to this unpleasant experiencefreaky slow employees were dancing chatting and only one person out of four was slowly working on our sandwiches they were out of wheat bread but didnt tell me until they made my sandwich on white bread and on top of that i ordered a vegetarian sandwich and got one with meat ive never had a bad experience at a jimmy johns until this locationwe have been here a few times the food and service was decent but nothing that made it a memorable experience until last night our party of 5 arrived around 730 the restaurant wasnt terribly busy there were empty tables and we were seated immediately we waited about 15 minutes before our waiter came to the table and took our drink order we ordered two beers and 3 sodas about 10 minutes later we had no drinks the waiter came back and told us they they no longer carried the beer that was on the menu so we understand that its expensive to keep reprinting menus when small changes like that but why didnt our sever know that they no longer carried that beer not a huge problem just a small annoyance we ordered a different beer and placed our food order the sodas came about 5 minutes later and we were told our beers were on the way 15 minutes later the beers arrived 30 minutes into our visit and we just now had our drinks we waited for close to another 30 minutes or waiter had been by to check on other tables and never stopped to check on us we stopped him once and asked if our food was coming soon he said he would check and disappeared for another 15 minutes he came back and said that our food was not ready the server tried to blame the delay on a large party at another table and the kitchen couldnt keep up it was a saturday night and the restaurant was not busy how is the kitchen not able to keep up needless to say after waiting over an hour we did not stay to see home much longer the food took we paid for our beers and lefti yelped gas stations this is just a wawa store they do not have a gas station or even a parking lot bad yelpi think this place is going out of business they didnt have any soda ranch or curly fries when i went in guess theyre having a close out salewe were told a 45 minute wait after 40 minutes we asked for the status and were told we had an additional 21 minute wait the girl at the front desk had an attitude they had open tables the whole time we were waiting didnt end up staying and just left the food that was walked past us looked good shame we couldnt have anyi know i am crazy for expecting good service from a fast food place in the city but it really should not be so impossible to find i went inside the checkers and they did not have signage for their two for three deals so i asked the cashier and she was unable to put together whole sentences and communicate the menu to me in a professional manner without getting extremely ignorant and ghetto because i did not understand i am sure people wonder why that location does so poorly and that is why they were completely empty with no customers which is why i went there in the first place because the mcdonalds right next door was bumping i went back to mcdonalds and received great service even though they are very busy i hope management sees this and fixes their problemswe ordered from smileys very often through grubhub their food is fantastic and the service has been greatuntil tonight we placed a fairly large order almost 60 worth of food delivery was fast but when we opened the bag it only contained half the food ordered we called smileys and was told wed receive the rest we then got a call from the driver who seemed confused and said he handed us two bags when he only handed us one now here is where the really tough part comeswe were waiting for a call and didnt hear back now two hours after the original order was placed we called back the restaurant a really rude female answered said the owner refuses to give us the rest of the food that he packs it himself and that they would send out one item from all of the missing items as a courtesy this is absolutely horrible customer service and im not only never ordering again but we will now dispute this order with our credit card company  very upsethorrible beyond words i was starving and it was still so bad i couldnt eat the pad thai with chicken waffle house has better foodi knew i was making a mistake when the place was empty at 6 pm never againthis was a filthy dirty awful place and the food was worse filthy door dirty floor crumbles on the greasy tabletop there isnt much to chose from on the lunch menu the tea was luke warm the soups were cold and congealed they forgot to give us the egg rolls and the sweet and sour chicken was bland and tasteless the lo mein was loaded w garlic but not in a good way no chinese noodles no eggrolls and no fortune cookies at the end do yourself a big favor and dont eat here it is greasy and grossssssssi have been wanting to try this place especially after i read all the positive reviews on yelp today i walked in and immediately noticed it was dirty i was already there so i just decided to stick it out and try something i got a half crab grilled cheese and the smoked corn chowder i thoroughly enjoyed the corn chower until i found a hair in it the grilled cheese was awful the crab must have been fake and there was just a little scoop of crab in the middle which didnt even fill the whole sandwich so basically i paid 899 for a regular grilled cheese and a bite of crab they lost my vote and i will not be returning   tip to the resturant there is no excuse for dirty tables and floors i dont care how busy it is  having your customers wipe down their own tables and chairs before they eat is a little ridiculous and disgusting if the customer facing side of the resturant is that dirty god only knows what the kitchen looks likeservice here is at the level of a 711  boy taking order gave off attitude that he was too good to make eye contact  condiments area had only one cooler which was unlabeled  could not get anyones attention until i had to raise my voice to find out what was in the container and get some milk  i left feedback with starbucks and will give one more try but based on other reviews here i doubt itthe seating hostess was quite rude and made a terrible lasting first impression when we arrived she was leaning with her elbows on the front counter as if standing up straight was too difficult she was on her phone texting and acted as if my husband and i were an annoying interruption walking us to our table seemed to be physically exerting for her that is the level of service you can expect here attitude reflects management and the employees behave like they hate being there perhaps it is because the servers do not get to keep the tips they ask if you want to leave a gratuity before they bring the check and ask for the amount making it awkward the check comes totaled including the gratuity this is an indication that they are pooling the tips and management gets to decide how they are distributed its tipping the business not the server how much does the restaurant keep we had the fried chicken and the batter coating was very heavy improperly seasoned and burnt it was pricey for a bbq place but the quality of the food and service did not justify the price hendricks has extremely poor service and poor food quality my recommendation is to skip this place there are so many restaurants in st charles that actually want your business but this isnt one of themthe food is meh but not worth the price i now just go at night when i feel like eating some ice cream and it averages no more than three stars   tonight the ice cream tasted like flavored water with sugar and had absolutely no taste to ice cream  you could make better ice cream freezing milk mixed with some sugar i felt dirty eating this ice cream and that usually only happens when i eat a triple cheeseburger with large fries at mcds    usually the ice cream is too sweet but i dont complain since it has at least some taste now it seems like they are cheaping out on their qualityquantity to maximize profit     service was also lacking as i felt like the cashier was more focused on his conversation with the employees than helping out customersjust got take out and they didnt include pickles or cole slaw with my or my husbands food come on ughhhhhhhsmh first off the employee was  very dry spoken and the food was even worst  i ordered some nachos and spicy potato soft tacos the nachos was very skimpy the soft taco was hard as if it was old and the potatoes was hard and dry very disappointing and disgustingi was so excited about blakes lotaburger opening on river and craycroft by my house i went through the drive through and couldnt wait to get home i was so disappointed by the dry burger on a stale bun i couldnt even eat it the only sauce it had was mustard and way too much i ended up throwing most of it away the fries were ok at best my favorite part was the sodai had high hopes decor and theme are cute it took over 30 mins to get our drinks another 45 on top of that for our food the other half of the table had there order lost something i had did end up having msg even though i explained i was allergic  i ended up getting sick twice i have now been sitting in the car over 42 mins while my friend is trying to pay our tab my son said  we are never going there again  so true i have never written a bad review and i feel bad writing it our server ended up being pulled from us to wash dishes because they were short staffed another server never covered a table not a good nightrefused or didnt know how to redeem dd coupon  created a very stressful transaction because they dont know how the  dd coupons workif you like bagels for lunch than this is the place they dony realize bagels are a breakfast food their hours say they are open at 700am i have been there a 12 dozen times and have never been able to get a bagel either they arent open or the bagels wont be ready for an hour the worst business people ive every run across  the bagels are good when they are availablethis place is not worth what you spend i got a 2000 platter came with two meats and two sides each meat came with three small pieces the bbq baked beans were disgusting the mac and cheese did not taste like mac and cheese the bbq sauces was runny which i do not like i like thick bbq sauce i would way rather have had bandannas and saved myself 1000 and would have been more satisfied please do not waste your moneystill waiting for an oil change it has been an unbelievable 2 12 hours several technicians shuffling in and out only one seems to be actually working will i ever come back  one guessvery disappointed with this location as i was common customer weekly until yesterday as location failed to open even close to on time as the keva juice associate showed up late not hurrying at all then once they arrived already late went inside and then locked door for no access for countless minutes as i grew tired of the wait i then leftsat down with another group in front of us and was ignored for 25 minutes the group in front and behind us were waited on and served immediately at the 30 min point we were finally acknowledged and asked for our drink order here at the 45 minute mark waiting in our food as the the group in front and behind finish their meals here on vacation and will not be coming back or rendering anyone to your establishmentmy boyfriend and i went here a while ago and it was a disaster  first of all one of the fries for one of the meals werent ready so of course we had to pull up and wait for the other fries to be cooked  but of course while we wait our food and the other order of fries is cooling rapidly  finally we get our fries and go home  well sure enough not only is one order of fries ice cold but they completely messed up our order  the burgers only had some of the stuff that was supposed to be on them  what were we supposed to do at this point  get in the car and go back over there  yeah right  my boyfriend tried to contact the company as they tell you to do through the website but of course he never heard back  im not really a fan of wendys at all but this experience guaranteed that i will not be returningtried to go at noon on a monday they were closed no hours posted and their phone was disconnected i suspect that they may have just shut down though its also possible theyre just not open on mondays in either event you might want to call before you make plans to go therei have lived in this area for four years ive been to this location four times customer service lacks rude cashiers and drive thru people the food also lacks in quality taste and preparation not visually aestheticeven the yogurt cones arent made with lovedrive a little further and go to the mcds on 301 in front of progressivenow thats servicegak my 4 yr old daughter says this is her favorite restaurant so on occasion i break down and we go to eat there and regret it every time i figured why she enjoys it so much she only easts the rice and beans  the guacamole is very expensive and not that good the burritos are huge but it is made up of mostly filleri come to this mcdonalds because its closest to where i live and i always have an awful experience today it took over 15 minutes to get my food after ordering at the drive thru then when they finally brought out the food it was completely the wrong order they then brought out the correct order which was still the wrong thing by that time i was sick of waiting and knew that the chances of getting the right order were slim to none this is the worst mcdonalds ive ever been to its embarrassing that no matter when i come they are never able to prepare the right orderbleck avoid the salad with avocado and feta extremely plain only ingredients were those in the name and way too many onions drinks were ok but the service was extremely mediocre there are too many great restaurants and bars to settle for this one i wont go back especially if theres a chance ill want to eatpatron is banned for life from all starbucks whats the matter with you starbucks you really got this one wrong handicapped parking is governed by the ada and the united states department of justice civil rights division not you and you customers  httpthezacornerfileswordpresscom20121215003stupidity1jpgclosed went on january 6th and the place was closed tight a passerby said they lost their liquor license and there is no note on door about reopening i have a groupon i need a refund on nowhow is this place still open every yelp review has said they screw up your order same happened to me and i went inside and they completely ignore you when you tell them your order is wrong and want your money back for them charging you for more tacos zero stars and worthless lazy employees dont ignore a customer when you know you intentionally overcharged them i dont think they expect people to come back and complain about their crap attitudes well i did but nothing got fixed because they acted like i wasnt even standing there put a complaint on jack in the box website fyi i was so insultedoh boy  dont know whats happened herenew owner  change in philosophy  cutting corners  the dozen bagels i got yesterday morning not very good sesame everything plain etc  these are not properly made bagelsshould be boiled then baked  these were not boiled  steamed insteadtotally different no crunch on the outside tasteless airy interior  and while im at itthey need a good top to bottom cleaning and makeoverplace is very dated old looking back to fishhawk bagels for mewe stopped for quick bite to eat on saturday at 8pm we didnt want fast food and we didnt want to take time at a sitdown restaurant so we thought orderatthecounter was perfect we ordered easily and the cashier was very nice after a full 35 minutes of waiting for our food we had to ask if it was still coming because we thought they forgot about us the nice girl apologized profusely and said our little wedgies had just come out of the oven they still had to be assembled a full 15 minutes later we received them the wedgie crust was not very good and the sandwich was the definition of meh the tastiest thing about it was the gobs of mayonnaise   the kicker is my boyfriend pulled a flat plastic fastener the type that comes with a loaf of bread out of his mouth that was cooked into his sandwich i wish i could give this place 2 stars because the people were nice but an agonizing wait  subpar wedgie sandwiches  plastic in food  we left feeling like we had just received two huge wedgies  they put about a teaspoon of cheese on my pizza it was all sauce i asked for more so then there were two teaspoons of cheese on my pizza but to their credit the spicy red sauce is tasty the crust was undercooked and chewygooeybasically raw  i ordered a cheese pizza id like to actually have some cheese on it  i would not buy again or suggest anyone go here they need to cook the pizzas for longer and maybe put some cheese on themordered a salad from here that was made with mixed greens  unfortunately it was mostly comprised of iceberg lettuce with a few leaves of actual mixed greens sprinkled in  ive never heard of mixed greens having iceberg in it  there other food is decent but this salad is just a way to cheap out on ingredients while misleading customersdrove 24 miles round trip on a cheat night to get a single scoop in a waffle cone currently my favorite treat  nope they are out of waffle cones  seriously get it together people  i should have followed the advise of all the other bad yelp reviews and not wasted my time   or i could have gone to the gymawful i had to return tortillas today because the bag was ripped open awhile ago i had to return bread because it had mold on it always check your food before you leave this grocery storedont bother waiting to get a seat you can place an order and wait for over an hour for your food  my husband and i left before our food even arrived  worse experience ever their excuse is a back upped kitchen and more dining area to cover if they want to continue staying in business i would recommend they solve that problem immediatelyi order from panera regularly while i travel i have ordered several times from this location their closing time for this location is advertised as 10 pm there is a note on the panera app that delivery is limited to within the opening hours m i placed an order at 830 pm and waited and waited and waited  i called at 930 pm and while waiting there is a message advising to place orders online or through the app after 5 minutes on hold i indicated that i had been waiting for my order for over an hour  the gentleman then informed that they had stopped delivering at 8 pm i mentioned that i had already paid for the order and the gentleman said that it is not his problem   i then asked for a refund for my 45 order the gentleman sighed and put me on hold for a few minutes he came back to ask me if i had ordered some side order what side order is 45 i said no i repeated my order and he asked for my surname he found it and said he could have it delivered in the morning haha  i demanded a refund and he got even more irritated and offered a few options i then said i wanted the ordered cancel and the gentleman asked me to not interrupt him i know the nerve instead of apologizing for be inconvenience i get chastised by this person  not ordering from this panera location ever againdessert is supposed to be a sweet but all we got was a bad taste left in our mouth  we came in as a group of 6 people the store was empty the employees were very rude the employee wearing a beanie hat looked stonedhigh and acted as if were were inconveniencing him by ordering the other employee also seemed like they had other places to be rather than work  weve been to several dessert places like creole creamery sucre yogurtland etc and never had employees act like they did at your establishment when we were in the area we saw snola snowball was busy and your store was empty and now we understand why we will not be returning  service was bad no complaints about the dessert itselfdont waste your time or money went there for lunch and it took 45min to get our order when the order finally arrived parts of my salad were frozen very disappointingits nearly 200 am and youre stumbling back from bourbon street towards your hotel next door to this arbys  but wait  late night munchies  the neon lights beckon  and so here i am at 200 am eating my 3 roast beef sandwich which took 18 minutes to get because the restaurant staff moved slower than molasses entertaining myself by counting how many drunk people can find the bathroom upstairs without tripping on their faces  by the way out of 10 people 7 of them tripped on the stairs  wow  that was worth the 3 price of admissionif it would be possible to give a half a star i would i mean its steak n shake so if youve grown up in the mid west you kinda expect slower service but for crying out loud the service was just down right poor in the whole restaurant our food came out cold and wrong and please do not go here thirsty because you will be dehydrated waiting on a refill   price wise its great service wise it was horrible and cleanliness of the restaurant was by far the worst sns i have ever seen i guess everyone is entitled a bad day better luck next timethis location really is uber baddd  its totallly unorganized and the service to their customers is non existant  the one rhing that they have going in their direction is that they are consistantly in the same mess wait times for regular menu items are loooooooong  20 minutes for a 2 is not worth the wait sorry ronald  cant  come back ok so how are you going to charge someone for a vip table and set them behind general admission and totally ignore them for an event charge for raffle tickets and then just take the first 5 people to make it up front mind you a general admission was in front allow the general admission folks to stand in front of you so you cant even see  uncle mikes smokehouse grill  you know you dont have the best rep with bikers anyway since you treated us like dirt when you were behind the harley dealer but this was beyond low even for youhad such high hopes and became very disappointed very quickly walked in the person at the counter had zero personality floor was dirty tables were not cleaned and the topping bar had fruit flies let me repeat fruit flies and this place was featured on channel 6 this place is a joke for the prices i would like to have my froyo fruit fly free along with clean tables and floorclean but they are slow and cashier doesnt know anything portions on churasco are tinyjust got uber eats terrible the sushi was warm and im pretty sure rotten my husband and i couldnt eat any of the sushi with a very funky taste never had sushi i didnt like until nowwe went here and there was maybe one other table eating and our order wasnt taken for 20 minutes we waited for food for 45 more minutes ended up leaving without food manager had an attitude for no reason we could clearly see employees standing in the back doing nothing three other tables left as wellthey have unreliable opening hours and dont seem to smile much i am going to only go to the other downtown location on tucker12th at olive they smile more and are always open as scheduledprobably one of the worst casinos i have ever been to in my life awful service horrible bars and nightlife the restaurants which they claim are award winning give me a break i have been to vegas numerous times and having lived in la for 22 years been to many casinos in palm springs and this doesnt even hold a candle to them   i was so excited to come here having just moved to florida but now having visited i must find another place nearby because i will never be back ever ugh what an awful place even the concierge were small scale rude  apparently gina spends a lot of time on here responding in a politically correct way to everyones review while not actually caring what they say her responses are usually we appreciate you spending time with us or thank you have you visited one of our 7 amazing dining areas   perhaps she could do more of her job and actually try and look into the issues everyone has the casino sucks the smoke sucks the rooms and service are horrible the bars are not even close to par standards nobody wants to stay because you cant play for more than 15 minutes my guess is gina will want to write back something on here about oh please come back and thank you for visiting as you know its a casino and you might lose money but have you tried one of our 7 restaurants  haha i would rather fly to vegas than go here even their atm machines and voucher sections were terrible  i would rather play for 10 hours than 15 minutes and not even get a good meal  in response to ginas comment about yet again their restaurants  woo hoo that you have award winning restaurants  who wants to go to those if everything else is terrible  vegas has a ton of award winning restaurants and so does palm springs  if thats the only thing youve got going for you thats pretty sad  people are going to spend a ton of money at your award winning restaurants and have an awful time  bummerfind somewhere else to go people  all you have to do is look at al of ginas comments on the other terrible reviews and its clear as day they have to say these things to hide everything else  btw zagat  do people even use or read that anymorei should be writing this review about how delicious the seasoned fries are but they never showed up   i will never order from pjs again first the guy taking the order didnt listen to a word i said ordered food second the order took a good hour and a half to show up and i live 2 miles from them finally when i opened my order it was completely wrong the driver said he would be back shortly with the right order didnt happen instead the same employer who didnt listen to a word i said calls me to say they cant replace my order because they are busy i explain to them my order is wrong and he said he took down the exact order eventually the asshole asks for my forgiveness that he cant have his driver correct my order and hangs up the phone when i said he should correct the order i will never order from these assholes againso i just ordered a pizza from hot box pizza in broad ripple i ordered an xl supreme on thin crust with no green peppers guess what was on the pizza when it got here yup green peppers i called the store and asked the manager and he said that the order didnt say no green peppers i told him that i have an email that says no green peppers he said that when you order online they have to transpose the order into their local system and that is where the error occurred really so he sent me another pizza when that one got here it looked like someone had thrown the box on the floor stomped on it dumped out the pizza scraped it off the floor threw it back into the box and then delivered it now i was pissed i called back the store and the manager sort of implied i was being a jerk especially when i asked for a complete refund and was told that it would take 34 days so apparently hot box has no problem taking your money when you order a pizza but for a refund they take their own sweet time broad ripple is kind of small we dont have a lot of options for delivery but luckily a dominos is opening in the strip mall soon and i will have other options thanks hot box  i know where i will be spending my money in the future which is really sad because i love their pizzahorrible experience we didnt get anything we ordered ordered grits got hash browns no explanation until we asked why ordered avocado omelette no avocados ordered baked breakfast sandwich got disgusting bacon on dry toast with no sauce there was supposed to be gruyiere with a mornay sauce then the checks were split amongst my party and the diners who ordered the same things got different bill amounts and we arent feeling great afterwards avoidthe service was horrible they had me wait for 20 minutes while my food was sitting behind the counter getting cold and were dismissive when i complained never againwow just got the asian chopped chicken salad a big bowl of chicken lettuce napa cabbage carrots thai basil tomatoes wontons sesame seeds sesame ginger vinaigrette but no wait there is no sesame ginger vinaigrette in my take out bag and im back at my office tastes pretty dry without the dressing had to use some of the soy sauce that luckily came with the sushi i ordered failmy husband and i go to this taco bell often we went yesterday i was very disappointed i ordered what i always order 2 tacos supreme i got 2 soft tacos with about a quarter teaspoon of beef 2 tiny pieces of shredded lettuce and 2 tiny pieces of shredded cheese no sour cream no tomatoes and no green onions in the last year i went here 3 times and got very poor service i think they need to change something this place is really going down hillcosi is cosno  at 830 am on a monday here was the situation 22 minute wait for oatmeal  no warning that they were out and needing to cook a new batch no strawberries at the oatmeal bar no spoon in the almonds at the oatmeal bar folks used their hands 4 empty coffee carafes and the only available was lukewarm  no salt at the condiment table the employee said she would have to get some out of stock no napkins  no mas cosi you got to do better in a damn major transportation hubthis a hangout for homeless bums and druggies panhandlers stand around in front of the store mgt does nothing about it dont stop therego to a casino and avoid the danger they should just close down cold mornings are the worst smelly loser just fill the seats stay awaythe waiter actually forgot our order no im not kidding after discovering this 20 minutes after ordering we just left not an apology in sight from any of the staff members either yeah were really busy amazingthere is one good checker gigi otherwise my opinion of this store it terrible they are not diabetic friendly the dont carry 24 packs of soda so i had to pay more to buy 12 packs they only have vanilla sugar free ice cream they dont have a express lane and as other reviewers stated the lead clerk is condescending and rude and abuses his power one time i was checking out and he was behind me in line i made an error thinking  i had asked for money back he jumps and tells me he was watching my transaction and i did not why was he watching my key stroke the plumb store is farther away from me but it is so much better and has more sugar free productsfirst time shopping in here today now im home  just found out that they mischarged green apples for red mangoes price i mean how could they possibly not recognize those were apples so confusednot pleasant shopping experience at allbought a tres leches cake  im about to eat it 30 min after i left and i find out its spoiled  no expiration date on package  i live far enough that it wasnt worth going back for a refund  wont be going backpretty bad experience this time i ordered the barbacoa tacos the guy put very little meat on my tacos he put more pico de gallo than meat i told him i wanted more meat and he said oh you want to pay for double meat no i dont want to pay for double meat i just want the meat it is supposed to have  i was pissed then i ordered a margarita they dont have anyone to make it nice give me a soda then  so i get to my table and the flour tortilla which is supposed to be soft is hard as a rock usually when i eat the 3 tacos i am full not this time this place used to be good i dont know if they just have a bunch of kids that dont have customer service skills and dont care about quality i have always had a good experience at chipotle not sure if i am coming back  not for a while management take note cant leave a bunch of minors to take control of a restaurant  not impressedone of the worst bbqs ever  i orders everything without sauce so that i could taste the meat horrible  order brisket sandwich wo the roll and pork ribs the meat wasnt seasoned nor smoked  lack pull in the meat and a smoke ring  the brisket i was served was in pieces as in the end   yuck  you would have to serve on a bun and slather with bbq to eat it all meats were dry unflavored and plain nasty  you need the bbq sauce to give the meat flavor  for the mac and cheese too white and milky  like they were stretching the  mac to the distance  guess what  it did finish wirh me  the entire 2 dishes were greatly appreciated by my friends dogsthis is hands down the worst popeyes ive ever been to the lady at the register was loud and ghetto she spent over 5 mins tryin to refund a 100 item for a man instead of having a manager do it i ended up leaving since i had two kids and 4 hours still left on my drive this lady is unacceptable as an employee and was very argumentative loud and rude to the previous customers but the extremely long wait due to incompetence was ridiculous drive anywhere else but here for foodin a word terrible your food included one tablespoon of mediocre gumbo 12 cup of decent jambalaya 12 a brisket poboy and two tablespoons of bread pudding  and thats it folks so be prepared to eat dinner afterwards  the guideprestonwas well meaning but inept having mastered his history three weeks ago his facts were contradicted by restaurant owners and their own written history on the menus  it was interesting to tour the innards of antoines but this tour is a tourist trap  avoidhalfway descent beer but the place plays the worst  death rock i have ever heard in my life  i was trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend but it was made impossible by the loud shit music blasting from the speakers  we even asked the arrogant bar tender if he could turn it down a little outside to which he simply nodded his head no hey 4 hands get over yourself your beers not that greatafter weekly breakfasts for 7years we are cutting this umbilical cord  drawn by their strong coffee and tasty dishes we loved it  now the portions have gotten so small and the bread rolls so tiny that we always leave feeling ripped off after waiting 1 hr for a table  the service is hit and miss but what i really love is the authentic je mon feu attitude of the owner  i dont think she has thanked us for our patronage in all this timei had 30 minutes prior to my flight boarding i thought well heres a bar where i can see when they line us up like cattle to board i thought ill have a couple beers while i wait two draft beers cost me 2398 plus tax and tip thats over 15 a pint ridiculousi gave the brimm house two tries the first was not good the second was worse i ordered 2 hot lattes 2 cold coffee drinks after waiting 18 minutes  that is not an exaggeration i decided to add a berry scone to the order yeah  my order came to the window 4 cold coffee drinks  didnt have time to wait another 18 minutes for them to remake 2 of them oh by the way opened up the scone box to have with my unwanted  cold coffee drink  it was old dry no joke maybe one berry in my berry scone   i will never go here again before my salon appts  i will drive on into eagle  drive backwill never go back i ordered from hotbox every week for company lunch  today i the rudest girl ive ever met in this industry  upon order she saywhat are you ordering can you hurry my shifts about over i said ill be just a second im reading the menu which to she replied its pizza it cant be that hard   shocked she is the one interacting with the customer pit her on dishes or somethingstaff in the evening are a bunch of douchbags better places to eat downtown too bad because its a decent lunch place the owners must have no idea what their staff does at nightwent in looking for a toothbrush and got yelled at for my trouble when i asked a older woman who worked there for directions to the aisle she was incredibly rude and i wish i remembered her name so that i could post it here acting that way shell never work anywhere better than walgreensdont order food here if you expect to get it in under 40 minutes ridiculous wait for a breakfast sandwichyuck i usually enjoy wendys but this one sucks fries luke warm and overly salted tomato was not fully ripe and had stem in it burger was dripping grease and the ketchup tasted like some of the cleaning solution got in it never going backawful food dont order fish and chips honestly was disgusting my wife order crab cake and it was too salty never everput our name on the list at 1230 for s party of 3 and was told it would be a 1520 minute wait after checking the wait with the hostess a couple of times and still not being seated after over an hour we removed our name and left hopefully their customer service will improve after theyve been open a bit longer but right now its lousynot impressed at all ordered a omelette and bacon the bacon was forgotten and never arrived also received a english muffin no butter or anything just a dry sliced muffin fresh squeezed orange juice was very disappointing food was dropped off and did not see server again wont be going back again until picking up the plates huge disappointmentdistrict donuts should really consider putting their exceptional schedules on their website somehow i have been restricted from going two years in a row i am from out of town and was told to try these donuts but thats apparently not an option for me the first time they were getting ready for a company holiday party i tried to visit in the afternoon and the second was today 3pm on a monday afternoon but it closed at 2pm for some construction i have now spent 40 in uber rides and have not had any donuts ive been told the donuts are good but this is just bad service in my opinion i shouldnt have to call in order to figure out if a place is open during their normal operating hoursdo not go here i had a christmas party and decided to order in advance over the phone i informed them of the headcount and described what i needed i paid for a party tray at 55 the girl informed me over the phone it was a two tray minimum and i thought it was gonna be to much but i ordered it with her when i went in to pick it up it wasnt enough for 25 people and they said there was nothing they could do and i then had to spend another 30 on a cake to feed the rest of the people they did not supply because i was stuck at that point the food was good but there service is poor and they are misleading i emailed them and hopefully i will hear back and they will fix this issue i will keep you all informed the deserts were good but not worth the moneythis restaurant has really really bad service and cooking very slowly also very expensive if you are not fking rich i recommend you better not comedont go to this ihop we waited for 15 minutes to even get a seat and there were two ladies already waiting in front of us the manager was just looking at us from the back and not doing anything my friend had to go to the back and get the managers attention so he can finally seat us the service is poor and they obviously dont care about their jobs never coming to this one againusually our go to for shakes and dinner in a hurry tonight the service was extra slow and unfriendly we waited about 25 minutes for dinner for two the screen changed indicating food was on the way after about 10 minutes we pushed the button again and were notified that the ice cream machine was empty and they were waiting on that food finally arrived cold without a sorry from anyone sorry sonic we are done with youi made my first visit to the daily bread bakery  caf today  they were not busy at all however there was no one at either register to take an order  i waited at one of the registers for about 5 minutes way to long in my opinion for someone to at least acknowledge that i was standing there and that they would be with me in a moment  didnt happen  i finally leaned over to speak with several of the people working behind the registers i could see so i knew they also saw me  i ask if i was in the right area to place an order  the girl yelled over to two other ladies that were filling the drink machine and saidhey you have a customer here  i apologized to the cashier once she was taking my order  that i didnt mean to cause a problem just wasnt sure where to place my order since it was my first visit  she said nothing  i placed an order for the albacore tuna sandwich  i saw on the menu board that it came with chips and fruit  when they called my number i was given a bag with only a sandwich  i ask if  the chips and fruit came with my sandwich and the server that handed me the sandwich rolled his eyes and looked at the lady that had yelled for the cashiers  she said yeah you can help yourself to the chips and a banana or apple  i know i would have walked out of there without the sides if you will if it would have been left up to the server  i took the sandwich sides back to work  i was very disappointed with the tuna  not much tuna lettuce and tomato on a large bun  what seem to be a very strong garlic taste was evident and i was unable to finish the sandwich  i offered the remaining half to a coworker who didnt care for it either  i will not be going back  too many other places to visiti was in town and this dunkin donuts was near my hotel on my way to work decided to pick up a quick coffee and donuts for myself and a couple coworkers  the lady at the window was extremely rude and just kind of shoved my bag at me   when i got to work and opened my bag the donuts were all smashed together and just thrown in the bag the frosting was stuck all over the bag no paper napkins  probably will not returnwe decided to give carlotas one more try tonight we believe in family owned businesses so we werent ready to throw in the towel we got here on a saturday night at 615pm there were only people at a few tables our first reaction was the competition pulled their customers away well that is true but the reason was poor slow service and even slower preparation of our food it took nearly an hour to get 1 green corn tamale a bean burro and chicken fajitas the food was ok however the margarita and horchata was good the only thing they were fast at was getting the check to us very sad but guess we head back over to oracle road for dinners from now onmy group and i were asked to leave because they had to make room for more people i will never eat here again i hope the manager sees this they should be ashamedthe customer service department has got to be the worst in the city all except one lady they are loud unorganized in one week a employee walked away from the counter without a word and did not return twice a few male employees are allow to sag their pants while on duty and appear unkemptsadly neither corporate nor the restaurant care about the food quality corporate 2as not even going to tell this restaurant about my complaint kfc at all locations has lost my familys business due to the fact that corporate did nothing and the owner never contacted me very sad i was not compensated for inedible and inferior food and we are done i would give 10 stars to this location and zero to corporate for their unprofessional handling of my complainti went to this place and they said they were out of hard taco shells another time they were out of ones and wanted to give my change in quarters my best advice is that if you are a fan of taco bell and looking for a quick bite while on a longer drive just wait until a little further down the road for the next taco belli hadnt eaten here since 2006 back then they had thick juicy handmade patties that were absolutely delicious however that was then and this is now apparently the place has new owners since then gone are those thick juicy burgers they used to have being replaced with a pitiful processed shoe sole that has the texture of wood pulp and the flavor of a dishrag one bite was all i could handle the burgers look nothing like their advertised pictures these patties are worse than any fast food patty i have ever seen or tasted with the exception of blazin burger which probably gets their patties from the same wood pulp mill yuk i feel bad writing this as the employees were very friendly the service was good and the fries were pretty good as well but the burgers are nowhere near what they used to be the rest of the food might be good but i am not going to risk another visit also the shakes were of the fast food variety another thing is the place was kinda dirty the restroom door was sticky and the restroom looked like something out of an old bus terminal this is where the employees wash their hands eeewwwwso disappointed we were 1 of 3 tables that were occupied in the dining room on monday night wanted 3 orders of red beans with ham shank told no problem we have 6 left waiter comes back  tells us there are only 2 left 1 of us orders breaded chops instead  they were over cooked had to ask for waiter twice beans were cold  bar patrons were screaming at the television tried to support our neighborhood establishment but well never go againi have literally returned their frozen gelato to them twice first time it was a vanilla bean of sorts second was a chocolateway too sweet both times i felt bad but for the cost i knew i wast going to eat it the sample was enough and i should have known other reason for the low scorecustomer service it has happened twice first time at the checkout i handed the guy who claimed to be the manager as he was talking to someone else while taking my money and i said the amaretto is excellent no response from him finally he said hi  how are you and then immediately turned and walked away what the hell second i wanted to recommend an idea for a flavor so i asked to see who was in charge at that time i introduced myself and he did not once i suggested the flavor he said seriously we dont take ideas for flavors from customers and turned away  honestly it kind of hurthorrible we were really disappointed soggy buns under cooked burgers and we waited over 15 min for them wed heard such great things about wc but after this our first visit we wont ever go back one of our only disappointments in nashvilledont go here and if you must go inside drive though is a joke they leave out items you ordered and get all the modifiers wrong on the burgers this happened to us the last couple of times we have been here my wife ordered a dr pepper and was given a fanta when she asked them to fix it they dumped the fanta and put dr pepper and ice in the same cup did not rinse it out or get a new cup then when we got home to eat  the food we realized hat our chili was not in the bag the fries were not cooked all the way through and there was lettuce and no cheese on my wifes cheeseburger even though she clearly order it with only no lettuce her dr pepper tasted weird with the fanta mixed in it and these are the people that want 15 an hour go to another location this one cant find good help and has been this way for too longsmells awful as soon as you walk in not very clean  some staff act very unprofessional  wait in drive thru is way too longhorrible management  food was the worst i have experienced in a long time  i agree with someone elses previous comparison of cheddars and the cooker   bottom line cheddars in mt juliet is not worth the time or moneyi just went here for the pie thats it the coconut custard looked and smelled like eggs not coconut the pecan pie we bought for 16 dollars was soggy and the filling had the consistency of bread pudding the crust under the pie was both soggy and burned i am severely disappointed this was my first time at this establishment and will be my lastperhaps good beer and atmosphere but horrible food never going back food was extremely salty very bitter very unpleasant barely edible tacos with little in common with mexican food  the fish tacos were edible but unpleasant and with the bitter briny  flavor of and extremely large amount of salt and the chicken verde tacos were inedible even more salty and bitter perhaps we came on a bad daybut just horrible if you want to eat what is on the menuso i use to go to this place back in 2005 with my family  havent been there since so i decided to go there with some friends bad decision they quality of the food had went dont tremendously we waited 20 minutes for some naan and the waiter got upset when we got new food because ours was cold the place was not sanitary and the chicken had little pieces of rocks oo save your  and go to new dali instead    last note the tandoori chicken was raw like still bleeding rawquality has gone downhill  i got my husband the breakfast burrito and he asked me  with all sincerity  if it was from the taco bell breakfast menu  it was also very expensive  one burrito  one piece of zucchini bread and two plain coffees ended up being 18i thought the first time i went there they were just having a bad day  so i returned a second time  never again the service is a joke20 mins to get my order and it was wrong the stupid leading the stupid  management should be ashamed for hiring the most incompetent people in indianapolis  one question for the employees what are you going to do with your life if  you cant even make a tacoive stayed away from reviewing and complaining about this location for literally the past couple years  i dont really have any issues with the employees personally its just the super slow and sometimes no service  i tend to go at night and no joke almost every single time ive visited over the past 2 years  theres something wrong  theyre either temporarily closed or their credit card machinecomputers are down or they are just crazy slow  there have been several times when ive gone straight to the one near 65 and southport even though its out of my way just because i never have problems at that one  so its obviously just this location  it needs a rehaul in management training and equipment apparently  i do not recommend going therethis is probably the worst starbucks i have ever been to went in for a simple double chocolate chip and what i got was milk mixed with water in a cup with whip cream on top would never recommend to anyone severely disappointedhave never been in here and i really wanted to but several things prevented me from stopping it i think the location is her horrendous and what else thats about it goodbye  location is closed by the wayi ordered an order of egg rolls and to go pineapple fried rice by the time when i opened it it stupidly didnt have any pineapple nor flavor in it and their egg roll wasnt not as good as it used to be not sure if im going to this place againi frequent starbucks often i have crohns disease and their chocolate banana protein smoothie makes a great breakfast replacement meal without upsetting my stomach however this starbucks location can never get it right the few times ive asked them to make it it always comes out very bland equivalent to the taste of milk bananas and ice its very disappointing and seems to be the only location that serves it this way  this morning my husband wanted iced coffee and this particular starbucks happened to be closest to where we were he ordered a mocha frappuccino with a shot of espresso he too was very disappointed with the flavor he said it tasted  as if they were skimping on using all the ingredients much like my smoothie if im going to pay the same price regardless id much rather go to a different starbucks location with better qualitythe service from the staff is beyond awful it took well over 30 minutes for us to get our food when we finally got it it was cold and unappetizing the best part of the meal is when we actually got to leave cool atmosphere but thats itmy salad was almost lettuceless and full of two scoops of pico and which was almost tomato only  also as normally happens here the guy didnt drain my beans and the whole thing was runny  if you order things mild expect medium because of the spices on the chicken    come to think of it the last time i went here i got sick  if it wasnt for the people i work with i would never buy lunch herei was really looking forward to visiting newtowns first french cafe what a disappointment there is nothing about it that seems french other than a small assortment of french pastries my family of 4 was the only order they had to take while we were there on a sunday afternoon they made each item 2 crepes and 2 waffles one at a time and brought them out one at a time several minutes apart by the time my daughter got her undercooked wet inside waffle everyone else was done and ready to go the crepes were just ok but my childrens waffles did not come with the toppings they ordered one ordered bananas and nutella the other strawberries and bananas with nutella both had weird toppings like apple cantaloupe blueberries and grapes we sent back the last waffle and left resulting in a very disappointed child i will not be back  only positive my husband says his latte was goodunbelievable first time experience here at this wendys  in tucson  ordered my meal which came to 1517 i gave them a 15 gift card and a dollar bill to cover the 17 cents simple right after the cashier called another teenager over because he did not understand how to do the gift card they handed the gift card back to me told me that i had 83 left on the gift card i explain to them that the gift card was 15 and since the total was 1517 they owed me 83 cents then the teenage female manager gets involved trying to convince me that i have a balance on the gift card after explaining twice the simple math involved she gives me my change which was incorrect so i waited again to get the correct amount of change very scary knowing this is americans future in making it great again  i understand now why it has a two star rating for this store need some adults here to supervise the childrennote we visited ted drewes the summer of 2010 but a recent conversation about this place prompted me to add my experience to yelp  with all the hype and 5star reviews i could not wait to try this place  seeing the long lines even got me more excited  finally i am treating myself to the famous saint louis ted drewes frozen custard  we ordered the plain and hawaiian  glowing with anticipation  first impression wtf is the big deal  second taste this is too damn sweet  third taste couldnt finish it and threw it out  honestly i prefer culvers chain restaurants frozen custard to this overrated overly sweet nonsense  normally im not this harsh but i was so looking forward to a taste of heaven and got hell frozen over  i thought possibly we got a bad batch but others around us were moaning orgasmically as they savored their custard  i apologize to all the ted drewe fans out there but if obesity was my goal then maybe id understand  nah i change my mind  there are better places id rather get fat  maybe im immune to the spell secret ingredient making you think this is delicious  ill have to give it another try just to confirm and update but for now  i dont get itwhen they first open they was awesome with a lot of fries in the bag and now they get your food wrong and they cheap on the fries but they still good overpriced burgerthis place isnt as friendly as other breweries the manager megan gave me a long disturbing stare when i walked in and no one approached me to greet me for atleast 10 mins she had made several comments as to why my kind was even there  when she approached me i was greeted with a false smile and confused look what i dont understand is that this being america in 2016 why are ppl still bothered by customers who are not white american  on several other occasions when visiting the bar i still recieve the same treatment as if my money was not green i have witness bartenders drinking on the job so i assume this was the easygoing place i found i was wrong and that they definitely have their prejudice the food is basic and cheaply made with a high selling cost its a disappointment that these owners are bias to the type of customers they would like to service  i live in the area  so i thought i was a great idea for a bar to be in walking distance from my home  needless to say i wont be returning due to the fact of the lack of customer service  indiana is not the place for these owners and their business if they do not treat everyone fairlyi have been here before  the rude owner so i thought was not enough to keep me from trying it again last month  my friend and i went there apparently when she was off  our two wine tasting waitresses were amazing one full of great advice and the other full of charm and personality  we decided to return again after loving this experience only to find the owner yvonne belittling one of the waitresses who was working alone  the place was also having a party for owner plus had the regular customers to care for  i will never go backand my 3 friends felt the same  such a damn shame if you dont treat all of your customers well nor your staff then get out of business because word travels fast my dearthis is the worst establishment i have ever been to they do not make your food properly here ive been here 3 times and each time they have made my sandwich wrong i keep giving them a chance and they keep proving they are awfullousy service make us waiting for 20 minutes until got served and have compulsory tips undesirable experiencethis review is for this location only not einstein bros as a concept company  after deciding to review this we realized that we should have consulted other yelpers and would have known how horrible this location is  firstly drive through took forever despite there only being 2 cars ahead of us  initially this wasnt a big deal because einstein typically just takes longer by concept and we were willing to wait for a great bagel  we were excited to get two of the healthy options which did not mention cream cheese or swiss like the other bagels did panda is lactose intolerant  one of the bagels had swiss and cream cheese and the other had cream cheese they were supposed to be the same sandwich  when we took it back in we were treated terribly by what seemed to be the manager none of the 6 workers were doing anything so we can only assume who knew nothing about the sandwich and ended up telling another employee to deal with it and then walked away  when we got the new bagel and returned to the car30 minutes later we noticed it still had cheese at what point do you keep trying to correct a 5 bagel  side notes out of most bagels workers not doing anything dirty tables slow service drive through and inside linehorrible customer service the girls there seem to just ignore you while the attempt to clean what is a disgusting dirty store stood there for a good 15 minutes just to get one scoop of ice cream  the people who own this place should honestly rethink on who they hire and maybe perhaps clean the place upthe absolute worst customer service ever i had a sleeping baby in my arms as i ordered and asked knowing the baby would be sleeping in my arms throughout lunch for them to please chop up the spinach so i could eat with one hand the counter person made note and said it was fine the same girl delivered my salad and said sorry they wont chop up the lettuce why on earth would they not chop up a couple if pieces of spinach for a person unable to eat with both hands who had a valid very small request i will never ever go back besides my 900 salad of spinach nuts and cheese was a pile of crap dont waste your money drive a block down to beyond bread where there is variety good food and great staffdoesnt even deserve one star i am 02 miles from this restaurant and it has been 30 minutes since i ordered my sandwiches and they still havent arrived i would walk and get them myself if i wasnt playing in a volleyball tournament and cant leavethe recording on their phone says they close at 1030 pm so i hope on 10w to get there around 940  they were closed  i called again while there  asked for the manager and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes  then the call ended  called back and was told the manager was in a conference  at 945 shes in a conference i asked  he said yes with a customer  i advised there were only two people in the restaurant and they were out on the patio so who was she meeting with  suddenly kim was available and came to the phone  i asked why are you closed if you advertise you close at 1030  her responseoh no we are open until 10  i explain that i just left because i was told you were closed and the doors were locked  she said oh no we are open  i advised again i just left there two people on the patio and amman sitting off to the side  the doors were locked and i was told you were closed  she apologized and said ahead only been there 2 weeksplease dont even think about comparing these pieces of crap to a ny bagel because theyre not even remotely close horrible disgusting tasteless stale bread rings worst ive had yes i am from li ny born and raised so i know what a real good new york bagel is  these are not wish i couldve left a zero star reviewsmoothies are good the raspberry vinaigrette dressing is very good   staff isnt very friendly and doesnt communicate well i appreciate the vegetarian fake chicken but as a vegetarian i dont like fake meat id prefer another option like rice or quinoa or beans which im sure i could ask for or customize  most places have made this easier to do menu seemed confusing or maybe it was the social awkwardness of the staff and the small space to order and wait uncomfortable placegreat coffeedrinks surly employees and 1 cups of tap water  we used to live in apartments nearby this coffee drivethrough and visit probably 35 times a week it was always our favorite drive through however when we went this past weekend we made out last visit we ordered a tea and a cup of water after receiving the drink and the water i was informed the bill was over 5 when i looked at the sign the tea was 385 i asked about this and the employee said the water cost 1 for a cup of tap water   i was stunned there are no signs saying tap water is 1 the employee didnt mention tap water was 1 when i asked for it a simple we are required to charge for that would have been nice and caused the whole issue to never come up when i expressed displeasure with the price and lack of informing me she simply said ive been yelled at for giving them away free  great coffee cant fault that prices seem a bit high for boise but i didnt mind however the attitiude of the employee the policy that tap water somehow is worth 1 and the fact that they dont tell you this means we wont be coming backif youve never been to a fazolis you havent missed much the concept doesnt seem to be too difficult but the lowprice niche means the ingredients arent exactly the highest quality about the only reason that fazolis deserves a star at all is their addictive breadsticks when theyre hot fresh and dripping in garlic fauxbutter theyre repulsive and delicious all at the same time next time you make italian food at home pick up a sack of breadsticks from fazolis there are no other reasons to come trust medo not come here if you want a salad it seemed like no one there knew how to actually do the salads they put way too much cheese and dressing on my salad and were really slow at making the whole thing i had to ask multiple times for cheese and dressing maybe thats why i got a lotso nasty the food is likethe crappiest sushi could be i came because i was enticed by how cheap it was but omg i couldnt eat more than one piece because it was so gross im surprised it didnt get me sick dont do it go anywhere else repulsion is imminentthe service here is very slow servers could use a lot more training food takes a while to receive after orderingbought a voucher on livingsocial  the voucher did not work on the website  i called them and they told me to email them from their contact page with my information and they would book the tour  i did this and did not receive a confirmation  i sent a follow up email and still received no response  i finally called again and they promised they would send me a confirmation which i never received  finally i contacted livingsocial for a refund and they informed me that this vendor had marked the voucher as used  it was not used  terrible customer service avoid  after posting this review merchant said they were sorry for the mis communication but nonetheless reported the voucher used when it was not blocking my ability to receive a refund on a tour i never received  beyond shady avoidive only been to the brewpub twice once for dinner and once for lunch however i have not actually eaten here as the service was enough to turn me off before i even ordered on both occasions my table was not greeted for a full 1520 minutes and when we were acknowledged the staff was incredibly rude the beer was fine but i would recommend any other local brewplace before the brewpublive in neighborhood and this rite aid is very convenient but my recent experience with a male head pharmacist have been very unpleasant he comes across as not very helpful and customer friendly very rude and not very courteous felt like a nighmare dealing with him even left a message on my phone and never identified himself on the messagefirst of all bread company is not a one  kind of place  i just paid 15 for a sandwich and a cup of soup  also since franchising the quality of the food and their prep work have gone way down  i got the steak and white cheddar sandwich and a cup of mushroom soup  i know the soup has always been bagged but now its obvious that it is due to the quality of ingredients  and the sandwiches are always just slapped together no matter how slow or busy they are and no matter the location  take some pride in the presentation when people are paying 10 and up for your food  ive been meaning to write this review for awhile now but put it off until now because i i was finally pushed over the edge when i had to stand and wait for a seat for 10 min whilst my food got cold  after all that i was practically forced out of my seat right after eating in the middle of writing this review  the bread co used to be a place where you could go any time of the day and get some great food and be able to sit back and enjoy your meal and work or visit with friends  now its like you pay 10 or more to be herded in and out like cattle  this visit along with many others to bread co have been the worst experiences ive had of anywhere eating out  in conclusion the saint louis bread company is just not worth the price anymore  oh and as i finish this review up in the parking lot there is a mother and daughter eating their lunch in their car due to no seating  ridiculouscalled twice to order food because the reviews looked pretty decent and was put on hold both times nobody ever bothered to come back and answer the phone as i overheard the manager or whomever scolding an employee and cracking jokes with others the man who answered the phone didnt even do it in any kind of professional way kind of a little incompetent if you ask meugh i ignored all the bad reviews and went anyway because i heard the sandwiches are good i got a pork sandwich and french fries to go  when i got home the fries seemed like they were overcooked 6 hours ago and sat out all day not fresh at all  sandwich was average at best  1527 poorly spent will not be going backterrible service call taker got my house number wrong called 12 hour later to confirm and said the driver was nearby and on his way my town is 1 square mile more than 40 minutes later  still no driver and no food i called the store but they had closed when the driver finally called 50 minutes later i had already left to get food somewhere else because no one communicated with me when i told the driver this  he hung up on me i left several messages on the stores answering machine  but no one ever called back i had to call the store and speak to the manager corey  who seemed to care less will never order from them again food was fair at best but very expensive in fairness we ordered there twice before with no issues hopefully they can improve their communication and customer servicei i just waited 40 minutes for food with my wife i got all the way home and they screwed up my order this place has the worst customer service i have ever experienced the wait is entirely too long we were the only people in the store when we ordered and they still got the order wrong i heard the hostess tell to cook 3 times with my order was and they still messed it up never spend the money here again ill just make it myselfwellwe didnt get to try the food because the service so bad the person who took our order was unpleasant and not helpful so we canceled the order and left if you dont want our money we will gladly take it somewhere else good customer service is essential to any restauranttheir food lately has tasted freezer burnt or something their ravioli and moroccan pot pie particularly theyre way over priced for what you get and the food is marginal at best i had high expectations and was really disappointed the interior is cool thoughthe hostess was very rude their were two empty tables and a line of people waiting to be seated when asked about the empty tables the hostess started getting an attitude dont waste your time and moneyi had regularly noticed the incredibly long drivethru lines spilling out onto speedway boulevard and thought this place must be good while passing by on my way to an appointment i was relieved to see that the line was only maybe five cars deep so with seemingly time to spare i got in queue it took twentyfive minutes plus this is not an exaggeration to even get to the window the extra wait time gave me plenty of opportunity to read the overwhelmingly negative food and service reviews online by the time i was finally to the window i had lost my appetite and chose not to pay i left so as not to waste my money on food that was sure to be bad according to consumer reviews on multiple sites i was late to my appointment as a result of what i perceive to be incompetence note to management if a customer is in a drivethru that customer probably has some place to bethis place is not worth coming to dont waste your time and money they steal your money dont give correct change back and then lie about it like wow how do you not pay attention and do basic counting skills dont come to this dunkin its a bad one for sure they stealtook 10 minutes to get anyones attention to actually buy or meal tonight  others in our group who got food elsewhere were halfway through their meals before we could get anyone to come out from the back we even tried calling the phone number and they didnt answer  had to yell towards the back  unacceptableon april 18 2018 around 530pm i stopped at the cracker barrel in white house tn for dinner i ordered meatloaf mac  cheese hash brown casserole and okra with fried cornbread and unsweetened tea to drink when my order arrived the meatloaf was burnt and looked several days old the cook took fresh ketchup and poured around the top of the meatloaf to cover up the dark and burnt meat the manager happened to walk by and i told her that i wasnt eaten this meatloaf she asked why i showed her what was served and she said she doesnt eat meatloaf and didnt know how it should look she asked if she could get me another piece and i told her no that it would come from the same pan she replied i guess your right the server came by and filled my tea up with sweetened tea when i poured sweet lot into the glass it made the tea too sweet after i finished what i was going to eat another waiter brought me out another glass of sweetened tea my cornbread didnt arrive until i was ready to leave a picture of the meatloaf is attached i have had several bad meals at this cracker barrel for dinner never a bad breakfast the sad thing is that i own stock in the company and fill obligated in eaten there please go rather a couple of exits north at the franklin ky or a couple of exits south at the long hollow exit to eat at a cracker barrelwe decided to try this restaurant for dinner because we had a restaurant certificate  i understand that they just recently started serving dinner  maybe that was a mistake we loved the old train station  the decor was lovely  it was our servers first night and she did a nice job  its not her fault we didnt like the food  i had the meatloaf and it was awful it was obviously frozen and nuked  dry tasteless and a little burnt around the edges  the peas were canned peas  the potatoes were yukon gold and they were mashed and good but just enough for a childs portion  my better half  had the gnocchi which came with a tasty caesar salad he claims the red sauce was tasteless  the rolls were not dinner rolls they looked like small sandwich rolls and didnt seem very fresh  we didnt eat those all in all we have to say we wont go back there for dinner but after reading the reviews on the breakfasts we may go and try that but only if we get a grouponi love fazolis but this location has the worst service i got a baked ziti combo with extra breadsticks and when they told me my total was 13 i was confused when i got to the window before handing over my card i asked if he could go over the total cause that seemed a little much for a 649 meal he got angry out of no where and just said yes that is my total without explaining i asked if he could go over it and he very rudely said he would get his manager and slammed the window i didnt even want it to come to that the manager was a little nicer but pretty much gave me no explanation again i said forget it and paid for my food they then began staring and laughing at me through the window i really wish i would have just told them to forget my order and went some where else that will be the last time i eat at that locationlive less than 3 miles away an they dont deliver guess i will drive to penthouse then your chain has lost my business foreverthis use to be my favorite place to get avocada smoothie but not anymore they raised the price and reduce the size of the drink i can understand if they raised the price but also reducing the quantity if they are trying to figure ways to make more profits lets see how they figure this out as they loses another customeranother service horror story  it was just another dinner and a movie nights  maybe a friday  it was kind of busy in there sure  the hostess offered with some insistence that we sit at the bar table  about 20 minutes later the table was wiped by the hostess and we were told to order  yes i do mean told to   blabbidy blah is your broth vegetarian  sure sure was the answer and she was gone  some time later out comes a spring roll which sits alone on the table  no water tea beer napkins or utensils  i would have left at that point except we were really really hungry but we asked for some tea and utensils and received instead a plate full of attitude so i threw the spring roll at the hostess told the waiter to piss off and went over to eulogyi was not impressed  i ordered take out i arrived and there sat my order on a table not under a heat lamp  myself being in the industry i would thing one would keep orders warm but mines sat on a table cold  as i took it and paid for it yeah im sure i wouldnt be coming backusually my go to acme tonight i came with monopoly pieces and needed to take care of those at the customer service counter brynne was apparently the only management on duty and grouchy and too busy to take care of the two of us standing there even though 2 employees and myself walked over and asked her for help over 5 minutes waiting i got my game pieces and left for shopriteits amazing how staff can make or break a company fran was apparently having a really bad day i wanted to sign up for the store card because this seems to be my go to quick stop shop also because i was buying the gatorade that was on sale 23 fran signed and saidnot with this line seriously there were only a couple people in line then she proceeded to try and scan a card to sign me up and just couldnt figure it out every key stroke she huffed puffed and sighed she ended up canceling the registration and just shoved the card into the bag and said i could sign up late aside from the less than favorable encounter with fran who im sure was having a rough day i ended up paying close to 8 more than i needed to all i needed was gatorade for a sick child after working a 12 hour day if this location wants to stay in business develop your staff to be centered on the customer otherwise this store wont make itperhaps the worst customer service of my life dont let the pretty ice cream fool you these people are rude not only rude but also dirty upon ordering i was shocked at the high price but im an ice cream fanatic but i didnt let that bug me too much the cashier asked me to repeat my order three times the music was very loud which is most likely why and threw my change on the counter not placed but threw i got my order which the rolls were sloppily done and right befoer i went to eat it i found a hair in my ice cream talk about disgusting when to ask for supervisor and the cashier yelled at me to get back in line are you joking i wasnt going  to wait another 10 minutes because my meter was going to expire but awful awful service i advised you to save your time and money theres plenty of great ice cream joints on south street hagendazs phileo or ritas where youll get much better service for a much cheaper price if i could give zero stars i wouldwow this place has gone down the drain i used to actually like pho bistro because of their amazing noodle and fried rice dishes after their reopening due to management issues the entire place has changed the servers are still slow but my regular order of the combo fried rice was disgusting the rice was yellow and there were very few pieces of meat it was so salty i couldnt even finish half of it   the new chicken popcorn is not chicken popcorn its fking soggy chicken nuggets thats been frozen and breaded so badly that you cant tell if youre eating toilet paper or food   wont be coming backfor me its between deviate and towyard for worst brewery in town i tried two beers here and they were both way too sweet like bad birthday cake no thanks the staff was nice but the beer was badive seen the man behind the curtain and he aint pretty  hungry no no no no no dont waste 10 or 11 dollars for nuked food thats been preprepared  heres the skinny  they hire a cook to come in every 2 days and bake cookies that are forgettable 2 types of scones 1 hockey pucks 2 haystack style dropped biscuits a la bisquick with sugar and shredded cheddar added blech and the cook poaches up a bunch of chicken and cooks a batch of squiggly pasta with a smidgen of pesto sauce the cook also makes unbaked lasagna when you come in they nuke your order and charge you a fortune its a total ripoff  no receipt is offered you must ask if you want one  tables are frequently dirty 2 out 3 i tried werent even wiped down  the place is nice but the chairs arent comfy and people come in there with screaming babies or talking on their cellphones its a cafeterria atmosphere and thats about the level of the food too  i tasted the curry squash soup and liked it but 6 per bowl is overcharging  nice staff but young and not very experienced  my friend and i will not go back for food ever again  she did like her tropical ice tea 2 for a small i think  if im ever in the area again i may try a tea or coffee  sorry dorothy but theyve bastardized you and yourstheyre too slow took over half an hour for two arepas their friday special a savvy functioning business would have plenty of their daily special ready to dispatch i dont even own a restaurant and i can conclude this   get ready to give up your whole lunch hour just waiting for the food then having to eat it like the goddamn tasmanian devil and drive like a madman back to workthe pizza isnt even that good and the people that work here are wannabe tough guys i came here and got a large hot chick pizza to go and about 15 minutes after i had got the pizza and was in the car i noticed that most of the cheese on my pizza was stuck to the top of the pizza box i called them back as soon as i noticed and told them about their mistake and they said are you serious dude we close in 20 minutes and i said its your fault for being reckless when you put the pizza in the box and i need a replacement since you ruined my pizza the guy said whatever just hurry the hell up i dont got all night i went back and got my money back instead of another pizza because the guy was disrespectful and i dont want to support that business any morewe were made to wait 30 min and even then the table was not set up the hostess was condescending and did not even apologize even after that only 6 out of 8 of us were seated because two earlier guests never left and the restaurant would not ask them to leave because they were chefs friends  the food is great and the service is good but this is unacceptablei had had the randy sandwich  last time i was here it was great today it was terrible  i let a young lady know how i was un happy she said oh that too bad better luck nest time seriously  very unhappy music was goodthe absolute worst jack in the box i have ever been to the person working there was rude and it took 20 minutes to get a milkshake in the drive throughjust got a chic sando when ordered normal burger for meal and skimped the drink wtf had bad luck lately with these fast food places esp in missourii am absolutely disappointed with their staff customer service it was 40 minutes before closing at 10pm and as i walked in  it seemed as if she was about to finish the clean up to close as i stood in front of her waiting she did not look up to me to greet me a welcome or a hello finally when she was done i gave her my order which she was not happy to do she literally threw my food in the bowl after i pay my order im still standing there as her bf walks in and kisses her in front of me i didnt know who the  lady was because she wasnt wearing a name tag but i highly recommend to serve your customers better because you have no business without useverything is so ridiculously overpriced for my boyfriend and i we ordered 2 burgers and 3 beers and a long island iced tea 62 fluffing bucks sorry but for your mediocre service food and drinks it is just not worth that much money    and as another reviewer said the menu said 450 for a beer and then she said 5 yes it is just 50 but after a few beers that adds up that is very dishonest and i dont want to give my money to a business that lets the bartenders decide what they want to charge and it made me want to tip her less and if i go back and they do it again i will lower the tip  if you have respect for your customers i will have respect for the bartender and wait staff   also everyone  that was with me at the bar told me to get the picasso burger because it is so amazing when i received it the burger was dry and bland just because you put arugula on a burger doesnt suddenly make it a fancy burger honestly it was like they were trying to polish a turd between two layers of bland bread   i have nothing good to say about this place except that the first time i went the owner was very nicebut sadly that doesnt make for a good barrestauranti was super stoked and excited to finally try dutch bros and i was very disappointed when i ordered a cold brew with light ice and gave me my coffee with lots of ice so i returned it and  i said light ice so she takes out all the ice and when she give me back the cup it was less than halfway full i was confused why didnt they fill up the rest of my cup  so she said that she had to charge me for another can to fill up the rest of my coffee that i alredy paid for thats ridiculous the fact that they tried to recharge me for itwont be returning  lost me  everyone im about to tell this story 2 if i could rate it a 0 i wouldim not understanding how this place got all these good reviews im seeing after today i will never return to this restaurant i had been here twice before late at night but thought maybe day shift was a little better we sat and got a coffee just to sit another fifteen minutes while watching our waitress play on her phone after she checked her social media and found the time to take our order we were served cold burnt food you cant just flip something over as if the person eating it wont taste how nasty something is well we are ready to pay at this point but gossip and once again our phones are more important than customers or your tip i guess my food burnt while you werehappy birthdayhope it was a great one because you lost good money and i will make sure i tell everyone to not waste there money must be the doughnuts keeping you goingstood in line 2nd in line for 20 minutes one guy in front of me waiting on the cashier  the cashier was just standing there smiling taking the sweetest time ever possible i could have gotten to a log john silvers in texas before he pressed a button on the register the food was poorly made thrown on a plate and served after another 20 minutes of waiting i could have went to the gulf and caught my own fish to filet them myself quicker than they threw  this fast food together fish wasnt the same as the ljs in goodlettsville before it shut down the one in goodlettsville was the best one ever there should be more of the around captain ds is a joke compared to ljs   81617   came back to try it out same guy at the register taking his time to give me 3 dollars back out of tartar sauce fish is dry how is this place still in business where is the gm for this place they need new employees and tartar saucethe employs were nice when i went in but omg the food is overpriced not even that good i can get better sushi at publix the other thing is the bathroom smelled like raw unseason fish that was slapped across the walls lights flicker a lot what is this the hash slinging slasher  overall decent service ok and pricy food dont go at night or the hash slinging slasher will get you bathroom smelled like crabsstay way from this place if you want to stay healthy i have visited this place for couple of time and both times i have experienced different problems in my fist visit i found a piece of hair in my food and in my second visit i just had a egg puff and pastry which upset my stomach instantly they need to consider this seriously otherwise these guys will be in  big troublewent through the drivethru on the evening of 5818 i ordered a bowl of onion soup and a baguette  not only was i shortchanged which i caught but they neglected to give me my piece of baguette  i will not patronize this location again  morons at workyouve gotta be kidding me right taco bell  i understand  the location its in is not the greatest but it doesnt mean to lack the standards the food was somewhat ok but looing around the place it was missing a light fixture they just left dangling with the wires hanging and also a busted window they were nice enough to ductape up had i noticed that before we wouldnt have even gone in  after taking to an employee the window had been that way for quite some time i hope the owner reads this and does something about it see picsi ordered a free trial but never received the product i had a small window because i was moving and after a week or so or waiting i just decided to forget about it and call them to cancel the fine print is that you cannot just call to cancel you must return the products its hard to return an item i didnt receive so instead of the agent advising me or explaining all of this to me  he proceed to offer me to extend my trial or to sell me more items at a discount  he did not do this in the politest way either i was so overwhelmed with the information and said no please just cancel my account i dont want any more charges or product and he said fine we are going to charge you full price for the items and your account is now cancelled full price how much is the full price no reply why would i be charged full price he said because you did not return the product to us i explained again that if i had the product i would gladly return it as this has been such a headache but i dont have it i was so frustrated at that point he started to get agitated and pushy and said good bye maam and when i cut him off to ask a question he replied i said goodbye maam and hung up on me i still dont know what the outcome was did i get charged i will have to call and cancel my card so they do not have my information on file anymore what a nightmare please do not deal with this companymy receipt show i paid at 1104 for a burger and fries  its 1117 and no sign of them yetgreat ice cream absolutely delicious but same price as other jenis and the scoops are much smaller  suggest order two half scoops in a bowl as you get more than one full    mean and they demand a tip on paymentso want to like this place and support it but the last time i was there water poured out of a bottle of ketchup  when we told the waitress she just put it back with the other bottles  never againi dont even know where to begin aside from if i was able to give 0 stars i would i wish i had read yelp reviews before wasting 2 hrs of my friday night we went there after my daughters preschool graduation this past friday since it was close to her school walking in it was a nice atmosphere thats all i can say nice about this restaurant starting off it took 15 minutes to even order drinks i ordered sprite for my daughter and asked for lemonade for my son  they said they were out of lemonade but had hawaiian punch i turned down the punch because of the high sugar content and opted for water which im certain came straight from the faucet they came back with punch anyways stating the sprite was out  we ordered the garlic bread since they were out of two other appetizers we wanted they brought them out uncut and gave me a steak knife to cut myself one was so burnt im confident they wrapped it in foil and put it in the microwave to catch on fire  i sent that back and said to just take it off our bill my husband and i both ordered the pasta with shrimp and garlic cream sauce when it came out it was a big lump of extremely gummy mush that i wouldnt eat if it was 6 months in to the zombie apocalypse the sauce was straight from a can and the top was covered in shrimp that wasnt even big enough to consider salad shrimp all cold i couldnt even order another meal as they were out of everything my children had spaghetti again cold and from a can my nephew ordered a calzone  then informed us they were out so he got pizza againnot cut they brought a pizza cutter for us to do ourselves  there is so much more but this alone was worth warning others i am not even sure they have a working kitchen aside from a microwave not to mention all the food is bought at a local grocery store im assuming frozenobviously i have no desire to go back i am baffled they have stayed in business this long its so unorganized its actually very sad 76 later even with items removed i had fruit loops for dinneri was shopping in the west shore mall today in tampa florida when i developed a craving for your product upon smelling their fresh goodness i was very disappointed  to find that you do not allow or offer mixed orders of salted and cinnamon pretzel bites i was simply told they have been instructed not to do so and its not alloweduntil this is available i will not be consuming any more of auntie annes goodness instead ill be spending my money at the other pretzel shop in the mall looks like ill be throwing away my rewards card sucks too i was only two more purchases away from a free orderfirst this place is a mess a dirty hole in the wall and i know that doesnt always mean the place is bad but in this case you can judge this book by its cover the tables are small dirty and crooked assume two meals will not fit comfortable on a table the staff is slow and lacks any intent the waitress is constantly taking smoke breaks what should take 5 minutes to make takes 15 youll even be waiting on a simple cup of coffee now to the food hash browns are covered in grease and raw theyre raw potato colored not brown no crunch dont bother eggs are fine  as is the meat the biscuts are good but the gravy has no flavor even the donuts are weak i hate this place and i cant wrap my head around why so many people like it i will never eat here againcompletely inefficient ran out of black beans by 1pm and when i checked out i was overcharged when i asked the manager about it she was completely rude yelling from the serving line to the cashiers station and stopping service so patrons stopped and looked absolutely horrible service try a different place in the plaza if youre hungryprices didnt match the quality i paid 33 for 3 jumbo crabs when they came out they were tiny and missing claws needless to say i was still hungry after this meal do not bother with this place its not worth going broke overi have visited this casino many times it is renovated but worse than 1 year ago for your pocket  you will lose all your money fast  all roulette automated or slots are set up to suck all your money in a deceiving way  and to make things worse now there is a 10 parking fee  this monopoly of deceiving guests with their truly rigged programmed slots should be illegal  not a fair game it is not about luck  it is a complete fraud  this casino makes 22 billion a year no wonder  you want to loose 300 500 1000 5000 quick fast then come to hard rock tampa it is set up for that precisely  spend 25 hours there and when you hit fresh air outside for five minutes you realize that you smell like a burning cigar  clothing hair lips eyes money oh wait not your money you lost it all socks shoes everything on you smell like a big burning cigar  hit the shower quick  i have not been back for about a year  10 parking is a joke they squeeze every penny from you  have they made parking free yet without any tricks or memberships i normally dont review fast food joints because we all expect less from them but i feel that the people need a warning concerning this particular kfctaco bell every single time im in the drive through which is pretty often the wait is excruciatingly long thank you kfctaco bell for consistently taking the fast out of fast foodshame shame shame i am originally from chalmette and usually get my king cakes from either randazzos or haydels thought i would try gambinos never again the cake was smashed and un iced they sent sticky packages of colored icing for me to do my self  paid over 50 for a do it yourself smashed king cake do yourself a favor use haydels or randazzos not gambinos  kinda of wrecked my party friends trying for the first time were very disappointed and i was toonever againmajor disappointment after reading positive reviews and seeing the line out the door i assumed this would be a great breakfast choice wrong wrong wrong i really dont get it  first the default coffee is hazelnut flavored fake sweet taste coffee and water are served in styrofoam and plastic cups tacky and wasteful  the eggs benedict i ordered consisted of cold ham very watery eggs undercooked and a heavy biscuit mostly inedible my friend had the pancakes with chocolate chips which were just ok nothing special overall this place seems stuck in a time warp with mediocre food tacky touches  foam cups and lousy coffee dont be fooled by the linesso many things wrong with my cake order for my 4 year olds birthday 1 the cake was not decorated colorfully eventhough i specifically requested its a kiddy birthday youd figure the decorator could at least put in an effort the cake was a very dull dark brown icing with equally dull 1 strip of orange icing around the sides i was guaranteed it would be beautiful and i had to take it home and perform some diy to make it pretty 2 the cake was uneven on the surface probably it has been sitting outside for too long part of the icing on the top had began to slide down  now lets move on to customer service no one at the shop was helpful they simply shrugged when asked questions they knew the cake looked horrible and said they couldnt do anything because their cake decorator was not around i feel this place has no work ethics and dont care about their customers theyre in the cake business supposed to be making people happy for their special day not making this mistake againordered online for the first time and i will never do it again mobile app showed a coupon that was an exclusive for mobile ordering so i thought why not app never allowed me to use coupon and when i brought it up to the store they said there was nothing they could do if i had know that i was going to be charged full price for everything i wouldnt have ordered it and now im stuck with it like i said i wont be ordering again cause right now i feel like i was lied to and then stolen fromthey charged 150 for each extra dollop of sour cream we asked for then charged me 299 extra per taco because i asked for steak instead of ground beef did the waitress tell us nope of course not  so done with places like thisracist i live less than 2 miles away from this broad ripple location and they would not deliver to my apartment why because i live in an area that borders a predominately black neighborhood 46 st so theyve redlined my area its a quiet neighborhood so are they afraid of black people  i spoke to the manger who was condescending and after telling her how i felt hung up on me she could of made it right  if my money is good enough at your restaurant it should be good enough at my front doorrestaurant week fail we met a group of friends to celebrate a birthday during restaurant week in january  after over an hour waiting for food they sent complimentary soups and bread the soup was a coagulated mess when the food finally arrived it was a disaster and was cold  one of the guests found a hair fried into their crab cake  my steak was so dry that when i tried to cut it it flew off the table the tiny piece that i tried had an odd taste that led me to believe it was old  the manager did apologize  however she attempted to convince me that the steak was put under a broiler and cooked too long  i have had steak at every price point from outback to maestros and never had something so disgusting  passwhat a disappointment i have been to sweet lorraines several times starting with lunch lunch was great accommodating good food interesting choices etc then we brought the entire family here for a luncheon thus began the downward spiral the service was slow the food was slow to arrive and it was cold when it arrived however the server took care it it new meals were served and we assumed it was a fluke we returned again had a very similar bad experience and decided to remove sweet lorraines from our restaurant rotation recently my husband and i returned and had a nice meal decent service and really since the atmosphere is good we once again decided to return with friends  big mistake we ordered 5 drinks they arrived one by one waste of time for the server and puzzling to us since they were all either sodas or iced teas and one glass of wine we ordered 3 appetizers the hummus and the mess o fries arrived first the fries were cold the spinach artichoke dip came just as we finished the hummus and we informed our server about the cold fries and she said oh i will take them off the check no offer to remake no apology nothing  then our entrees arrived our of 7 entrees 4 yes four were overcooked my husband ordered the zip steak and for 24 we expect a steak to be cooked correctly he ordered it medium and  medium steak should have a thick band of light pink through the middle his steak was cooked through consistently grey on the inside no visible pink at all clearly well done as he was telling our server i was cutting my toddlers grilled chicken i needed a steak knife to cut into it as it was way overcooked and really too dry to eat we sent those 2 dishes back and i tried my tuna it was so dry it was crumbling no pink no flakiness it was literally crumbling we also sent that back my fathers baked chicken was also overcooked but at that point he said forget it and didnt bother sending it back in addition my mother in laws  when my sons chicken and my tuna came back they were fine my husbands steak however was not it was medium well when the manager came over she asked how everything was corrected and my husband told her i cant believe it but this steak is still not medium there should be a band of pink on the inside about 140 to 150 degrees this steak has little to no pink it is medium well inside of countless other less offensive responses she could have made she said well there is a bit of pink see right there pointing to a very small spot of pink  so i dont think it is well done  we were stunned never in a million years did i expect the manager of a restaurant to argue about something as basic as this a few moments later she dropped our check telling us she took off an appetizer and took 15 off the check she never came back and we only saw the server once in passing as she dropped off previously requested to go boxes our dog ate over cooked steak that night  no offer for coffee or dessert no invitation to stay we were basically present with our bill and ignored  we decided to go elsewhere for coffee and as we left asked to speak to the manager she came out and we commented that we felt rushed out and we never offered any coffee dessert etc her reply which was that was out servers job just felt like passing the buck once again and that we would not bother trying to speak to her and that we could talk to the restaurant manager the next business day and the director of peddlers village restaurants  this experience could have been saved with a good manager who thought of customer retention and how to go just a little bit more than your customer expects instead she left us angry and irritated and frustrated with what was supposed to have been a fun night out  i will update this review after i speak to the upper managementthis place is a total ripoff the burgers are tiny  bland for 13 i expected an amazing burger i ordered the ramsey burger bc i love pimento cheese i literally got a tiny well done patty with the tiniest dollop of pimento cheese seriously for 2 people we spent 50 for 2 burgers  2 drinks  i will not be back if you want a good burger try sportsmans grillworst pad thai and white rice ever the white rice i got is the same color as my orange pad thaii am extremely mad i came from the one on oddie boulevard an they were supposed to be open but no they were closed i was greeted at the driveup window with the sign saying they are closed for cleaning but i didnt see anybody cleaning inside so that unfortunately meant i had to drive all the way over to a jack on the box the 7th street one in renoi was not greeted or acknowledged by anyone in this store once a picked an item up and walked to another area of the store an associate nearby asked if i needed help she had not offered to help me prior to me selecting an item i informed her that i was still looking around and she offered no further assistance i selected and other item and walked around the store looking for someone to ring me up i finally found someone and she only asked if someone had helped me i replied absolutely not she simply rang me and that was that i then stopped by the shoe department and again no acknowledgement from anyonewe stopped here at 1140am to have lunch  the girl promptly told us no lunch would be served until noon  most places start lunch at 1130  i havent been here in probably 3 years and wont be back  plenty of other places in the area to eat lunchits a freakin applebees are you people serious  nothing but a bunch of bought in microwaved crap  save yourself the money and buy a frozen dinner bc thats what theyre doing in the kitchen at applebeeswe went there following the ratings here and we regretted expensive plain food kinda of a dive bar feeling we had soups plain tacos tasteless and pasta over cooked and plain not where you want to take your family on vacationwhen i looked up the hours of operation here it said 7 am to 3 am i arrived just before 230 am after a late movie to get some quick food however when i pulled up i was refused service had i shown up 5 minutes before their closing time i would get that but they were open for another half hour when i arrived why have hours of operation if you arent going to provide the service youre there for in the first placelet me start the review out by saying that ive actually never eaten here because its never open when i go there im not sure if this place is still open since i live less than 05 mi from there i walkdrive by there quite often there are no hours of operation posted and the ones posted on yelp and facebook apparently arent correct since i was just there about 20 minutes ago and they were closedthis is probably the poorest excuse for a pizzeria ever let alone a nyc style pizza place the burned my calzone and then they made a new one when i got home to eat it i was disgusted with how salty their ham is i might as well drink a cup of salt water next time the pizza was terrible their cheese is mediocre and their sauce comes from a can from who knows where even the lady said she wasnt sure if she was even allowed to tell us that they buy their horrible sauce the pizza was atrocious and it stuck to the box ill post a picture above never will i go back to this place im from jersey just moved down here oct 2016 and i can tell you that this place doesnt touch city pizza or jersey pizza the only thing nyc about this place are the plaques and pictures he brought down from a corner store in times square but even those might be fake ill never eat here again id rather drive home over night pay the 15 toll to get into the city and go eat a 1 slice from papaya dog than to ever eat here again stay away from here trust me not worth itwas excited to check this place out with a friend i havent seen in a while first impression is that its loud server recommend 2 beers ordered the 4oz taster when i said what i like one was ok the other tasted like fermented grapefruit juice very unpleasant however the absolute worst part was the food i ordered the chicken verde tacos the plate looked good but the salt level made these tacos literally inedible fortunately they removed the cost from my check but i did sense some annoyance about it wont be returning after an overall bad experience we left this place took a walk around the corner to another bar on cricket street where i had a nice beer a decent sandwich good service a nice atmosphere and a sighting of jason kelseythis is a kfctaco bell combo place  both are housed in same building  this place isnt unlike many fast food places along an interstate  restrooms stink womens restrooms entrance door is too long and you have to body slam the door just to get in  seems many fast food places cant count past 5 left off one of our orders but we deal with that all the time with our party of 6  during a holiday weekend lunch hour ran out of chicken on the bone which would be a 15 min waitoh wellappears the facility is nearly new with modern tables and chairs very large open area and fairly clean no food on the floors and tables pretty clean  just hard to tolerate poor restroom facilities especially in this location where you can count on foot trafficin our search of tasty indian food in west philly we walked away disappointed  the malai kofta balls were like clumpy cream of wheat not so good    it seemed to cater to the university student crowd with its overemphasis on the buffet  give me some love not buckets of food    ok enough knocking it  the baigan bharta was decent but well keep searchingi ban you this starbucks will never get my business there is a reason for handicap spots and what they are not for is your hoity toity customers that think they and only they are too good to walk that extra ten feet to buy your overpriced coffeetepid dirtwater coffee and stale churro dossantcronut  one star to the excellent staffcustomer for 10 years this store has gone way down hill drive thru is extremely slow and inconsistent 0 stars when i go through the drive thru and still have to go in 10 mins later to find out where my order wasbest thing here are the donutsservice terrible the food was cold and the taco salad dressing was overpowering  this is definitely off my listclosed as of 1313 if you bought a groupon you can redeem it at marhaba across the bridge in lambertvilleas i quote the slogan above me for giving this one star eek methinks notim sorry i wanted to like this pizza but when we had pizza delivered to our home it was worse than frozen the crust was like cardboard and had no flavor we moved here last year and cannot find a good thin crust pizza to match i cant even give this 1star however i had to leave this what are we missing thats different than all the others that like this pizza omgtried to eat at four hands on july 3 after leaving the ballpark after another rain delay started some fat guy chased us off the lot said we had to pay 20 to park and eat even though the game was in the final innings tried to find other parking but all 4 hands parking was off limits so we left not good business to chase people awayi love einsteins and im very sad that i hate this location so much eveytime we go the customer service is horrible and something is always wrong with our order today they were even out of plain bagels how does that happen i hope corporate gets a hold of this place soonatmosphere is cool food is not great  service is terrible i wont be back and would strongly recommend you avoid it as well  we waited to be set down then waited to get our drinks only one refill the entire 2 hours we were here then we ordered and they forgot to put my food in and said it would be at least 10 more minutes before mine came my husband ordered pick 2 i said would bbq be faster they said yes and quickly brought a pick two like his not only did we not get an apology from a manager they charged me for both meats then we waited for our check service was so slow it took us a few hours for something that shouldve taken at most an hour  the restaurant was not very busy and there just wasnt an excuse for such bad service and lack of trying to make up for thisabsolutely slowest most disorganized panera ive ever been to  and i go to a lot of paneras and own stock in the company  people waiting in line for the one slow cash register person  meanwhile three workers in the back basically talking to each other  skim milk container was empty   asked the cashier to get a refill  she didnt do anything  so put it next to her at the cashier  still didnt do anything  family to ask another person to refill it  what she did after a few minutes  should take all of 15 seconds to refill a container  actually the whole crew looked like they were out to lunch and would need massive doses of coffee to wake up  the carrot cake muffin was dry  looks like it was from day before before  if you want slow out of it workers and day old food this is the place for youthe service is really bad  there were 4 or 5 tables when i came not busy at all  but the waitress gave us menu and walked away without a word i was waiting for about 15 mins and no one asked me for drink or any apologize if they were too busy so i leftis this a cafeteria style brunch you walk in place your order and sit down with a number took forever to get our drinks then if you want water soda etc you have to get up and get it yourself dirty tables everywhere tables arent prebussed now to the food horrible biscuits and gravy its turkey sausage gravy over biscuits the biscuit was good for an egg sandwich maybe but the gravy was disgusting it had an orangebrown look to it it looked like thick puke and it was so thick you could have plastered walls with it it stuck to the back of my throat and couldnt go down ill never go backtheir food is the absolute best  ive never taste mac  cheese like that before however their service is horrendous  my husband and i walked in through the main entrance just to find that the unorganized group of people waiting to be seated were by the back door take out entrance   there is no specific order to how they call people to be seated there were two other couples who came in after us but seated before us when we realized there isnt an order in which people are called to be seated  after we finally got seated we had to wait over 5 mins for someone to even acknowledge is sitting there with nothing in front of us  the person who came to assist us was the owner who disappeared after bringing us our drinks  their glass cups are small so when it was time for us to get our refills everyone was busy running around like chickens with their heads cut off  we had to get up and ask the owners wife for refills same thing happened after we waited 15 mins for our check   two other tables had to do the same thing so they could get their refills  checks too   then when i had to use the ladies room none of the stalls had any toilet paper  there were no napkins to dry out hands with so i had to wait another 5 mins for someone to hand me a roll of toilet paper   the only thing good about them is their food but they seriously lack any form of customer service and this will be their downfallthis subway shop is awful they are slow the sandwiches are skimpy  and they are very unfriendly and rude we had no cash that day only credit cards on us and they waited to make us wait in a huge line and get our sandwiches all ready to let us know that their credit card machine had been down all day everyone in line behind us just left they threw our sandwiches in the trash my daughter was crying because she was hungry what idiots  how rude and what a wastei dont believe that you can give this pizza a positive rating if youve ever had pizza before  sure you get to add as many toppings as you wish but the dough can not hold more than one   its soggy who wants soggy pizza how can a pizza be ready in 3 min   its tasteless when they ask you if you want salt add the salt because it needs it   i only went in because i was hungry had an hour to kill and willa jean only had the brunch menu available   ive never liked these make your own pizza joints this one just kept that feeling alive pizza is about the bread too and this one just doesnt cut it   i only give it a star cause the employees were nicesays online your open but when we show up your all closed up so on snow days you close maybe post this online instead of saying your open two others there also and had went to another one and it was closed also  what a jokei attended an event there you would think an event which draws in strangers to your business would be an opportunity to show your best  ill just say the service was not bad it simply did not exist sixtey or so people stuck in the same room for over five hours  two servers  whowere never ever trained at their jobs    what do i know  i only eat out ten meals a week or more  shoot yourself in the foot   the sad part is the food is good when it arrives within the hourim have a big issue with germs  when i eat out doesnt matter what the restaurant is i request plastic utensils  im at this restaurant for the first time and request a plastic fork  they refuse to give me the fork because im eating in  they have plastic utensils but wont let me have one  luckily i found one in my car  i will never eat here againordered jumbo crab legs which were 60 per pound only got 2 legs and it was bland as fuck the fried shrimp we ordered was also bland and very greasy definitely not worth it never going back shout out to chickie and petes theyre the real mvp their crab is wayyyyy cheaper and 100 times better with more quantity and not to mention delicious with what we paid for 1 pound at this place we couldve had quadruple the crabs at chickie and petes this place rapesnever coming back here again all of the glasses had a crusty cloudy look to it silver ware and coffee cups were all crusty and dirty waiter spilled coffee all over our table and didnt bother cleaning it up i ordered the green juice and on the rim of the glass cup it was covered with what looked like rolls of dust and particles as i ask them to replace it but instead they just wiped it with a napkin and gave it back to me with particles still covered around it it looked like they stored the glasses in a very dusty dirty shelf or kept them on a dirty floor i didnt bother drinking it nor will i come back to this filthy place again there are flies everywhere in the resturant alsohow many bad reviews is this place gonna get before someone actually does something about it lol its sad the 30 min i waited in line i saw one worker storm out and another lady stop the manger outside to bitch about an employee messing up her food and then being not fixing ityikes your better off going to mcdonalds next doorfirst the good the burgers look really good the bad is they taste pretty awful if you like mcdonalds you might be happy food was also cold not room temp cold coldpoor service and bad food waitresses were rude the food was overcooked will not come backwhy must people fix things that arent broken   after coming here for almost two years for the most delicious chicken this side of the cumberland i got take out the other night and was told i couldnt get my usual xxhot order   whhhaaaaaa i asked   we changed our spice blend and we dont do that anymore   about six months ago they shrunk the size of their tenders that was one thing   this was quite another   why hot stuff why your old spice blend was amazing please please please go back or at the very least give me the recipemy first experience at this store was  sub with burnt meatballs so i didnt go back for awhile  i went back this week and got a footlong steak sandwich yesterday and was surprised to see how little steak was on it  i went back today and ordered a six inch and watched the employee put the exact same amount of steak on my sandwich 6 inch or foot long youre getting the same amount  im not a satisfied customeri went one time to this place and had the blandest chicken tenders i have ever had i forgot what my wife had but she remarked on how bad it was as well then we heard from everyone else how great it was so i gave it another chance on a lunch meeting and while it was a little better it was still quite bad i got the chicken fried steak and it was not very good the prices are low if you want to eat cheaply but i would rather pay a little more for better foodthis place used to be fun i would visit very regularly before all the greedy changes i was typically there a few times a week i was a platinum player i earned that status i would get weekly free play invited to redeem free gifts and usually 1 free meal for 2 at any restaurant  then they changed the slots changed you cant tell me they didnt change the payouts of the slots  they put in place some crazy point system that earned you a few bucks in free play nothing else in the mail  i used to feel appreciated i would blow my cash but got a little in return any time i was invited for drawings or gifts i always spent money   i continued to go for a while once i finally realized that this was a permanent change i was done i read an article online basically stating they were trying to attract super high rollers they werent interested in the locals i know after to talking to casino employees i am friends with they are trying to get rid of the nickle and dimers the people who got 5 in free play a week who would ride it out all day and night and walk out with 100 so that was it for me  i pass this place daily and dont feel the pull of adventure like i used to   i know the house always wins the fun of gambling is the thrill of the chase but when you lose 500 in 30 minutes when it used to last for hours and hours its time to quit  they are the only game in town so if it comes to a vote again get out there and vote to open up gambling once they have competition they will beg us little people to come backrude white lady at the window and she rushed us we only orders 2 fires around 11401150 on this day she didnt want me to get her name so she didnt give me the receipt i wont eat there againbefore i can get to the attitude of this place let me tell you we walk in when there is no one at all maybe one person and they seat us near the restroom the waiters couldnt seem to be able to find their way to our table for like half hour also it took the staff 40 mins to bring us the food after we ordered some of the food was completely cold i wish i could say the food was bad but the food that was not cold was pretty good but i cant give it a good reviewawful ordered 3 burgers all were overcooked to the point of being burned the sweet potato fries were mushy and tasteless kids hated it and barely ate plus its overpriced 60 for lunch 2 adults and 2 kidsi came here with a large group the day after thanksgiving for lunch and we were underwhelmed disappointed and annoyed by the poor service  oh and the food was overpriced and forgettable  we showed up with ten people so youd think a recently newlyopened restaurant would welcome a large party  instead the woman taking the order at the register was rude impatient and unfriendly  the manager seemed annoyed that we wanted to push a couple tables together so we could sit next to each other  when i asked someone behind the counter for a spoon for my twoyearold daughter he grumbled and reluctantly handed one over to me  the food itself overpriced  chips were extra  you had to pay for salsa  tacos were not too expensive but if you ordered two or three you got to about the same price as a baja fresh or chipotle so it was actually more expensive given that chips or salsa were considered extras  the menu itself was short and a big strange  the only chicken option was breaded and fried  and when we asked the staff person confirmed that they used a trans fat oil to fry the chips and the chicken  they said that since they werent in philadelphia they didnt need to comply with rules to use transfat free oils as if that was a good thing  so no i wont be going back to this place  poor service bad pricing and weak food arent an winning combination   with better options at qdoba and chipotle nearby ill be surprised if this restaurant is still here in a year or soif you want to wait in the drive through for 30 minutes for some nuggets and ff because thats all youre craving at midnight then this is your place yes 30 minutesa very poor example of a local philadelphia bar we thought there was hope then the owner said they were closed at 905pm for a celebration eagles super bowl beer no respect fly eagles fly we will find thatbrewerytown spotif i could id give no stars for them to take so long youd think food was fresh no not at all highly upsetsometimes theyll deliver to my job sometimes they wont id rather just not deal with them anymore and give my business to someone elsethe drive thru worker her name was ashton completely rolled her eyes at me when i asked for barbecue sauce it doesnt come outta your paycheck girlfriend not only did she only give me one but she gave me sweet and tangy the eye roll led me to believe that this was intentional she then threw all of my items in the bag at me and said have a great day even though it was 10pm in the most miserable monotonous voice   oh and i asked for a side of mac and cheese but i got mashed potatoes instead   if youre not happy please just find a new job and stop taking it out on customersfirst of all why is this place so packed i was with two other people and we all ordered normal burritos with chicken nothing special and while we sat down and started eating our burritos expecting it to be delicious we all found pink and saugy raw chunks of chicken in our burrito i dont think letting chicken sit out is a good idea either also the place was dirty and we all just had a horrible experience never again    believe me baja fresh which is right across the street is so much better safer healthier and more fresh baja fresh is the bestvery uninviting place the employees i encountered came off so cold beware of the attitude behind the counter  the seafood had way too much old bay it was salty and inedible you would be better off just buying the fish and taking it home and cooking it  i think its gross to smoke cigarettes inside a place where food is being prepared its even more gross when the person smoking the cigarette is touching peoples food directly after without washing their hands if your going to smoke you should respect the fact that not everyone smokes and just go outsideits 8pm im the only customer and it took 20 mins just to make my pizza and me receive it the place was dirty and the employees were very unprofessional good luck keeping your store openchinese food was horrible  typical tourist spot with tons of children on field tripsthe breakfast sandwich was mediocre and the coffee was terrible also very overpriced even if the food was good i dont know how this place got such good reviewsgave them another try today  smdh  how does this place stay open  customer service non existent always out of something or something not working  really dont know how they even stay open  i would be embarrassed to own this location   once again on 3517 gave them another try  what a god dam mistake  i swear dunkin donuts needs to just shut this location down  the worst managed location in there history  waited 20 minutes got parked and then brought the wrong food cold thrown together like it was shit  unbelievable please do not waste your time or money  this place sucksi have shopped at many a whole foods stores but never have i ever experienced such bad customer service as i did at this particular location employees act like customers are an inconvenience no level of decencyjust rude people who would rather socialize than do their job  if they want this store to succeed corporate needs to clean house15 minutes from when i ordered till i got my food however they were busy with one car in front of me lol got my food it was all messed up tasted like crap no meat on my mexican pizza only beans 8 for that crap never againworst visit to this location yet  dining area dirty no tables wiped down food all over carpet coffee station selection half empty another customer asked for half and half container to be filled twiceit took a long time to write this review but if i could give it a lower mark i would  when i arrived to pick up cakes for my sisters baby shower they had messed up the order  oh but wait when i arrived they didnt have the entire order missing one cake  one was supposed to be vanilla the other chocolate  the one they were missing was the vanilla cake  when i sliced the cake  both were vanilla  i took photos and emailed the bakery  they asked me to send photos so i did explaining my disappointment with them and was from then on ignored  i will never go back to that bakery and i tell everyone to go somewhere else because of how awful they were and how rude they were to a paying customer who didnt even get what she orderedmy brother and had a reservation for the hotel in the casino for the weekend despite booking on the phone for this hotel they booked us at the hotel location on hollywood fl then told us wed be unable to get our room reservation refunded my brother had to talk to the manager to get anything done terrible service at a nationally known brand we expected morewow my husband and i had been really excited to try this place but it was such a disappointment we ordered drinks appetizers and entrees at the same time as soon as we arrived an hour later we only had our drinks other patrons were also clearly frustrated about the wait time they had many togo orders which seemed to be prioritized over the orders placed in house we watched items arrive at tables out of order in response to complaints that they received we were almost ready to leave when everything arrived at the same time and most of it was cold or overcooked specifically my burger came with no condiments or bacon as ordered the fries were cold the scotch eggs were overdone the cheese curds were soggy rather than waiting for replacement items we elected to leave the owner graciously comped our food which we appreciated and was not our intention though it did not make up for the poor experience sadly we would not return a great concept but poorly executedit is not as good as it has been i the past beer was good but the food and service were less than satisfying  not even adequate   highly disappointed  i have been coming here since 1990 i may not go backworst slowest location ever i am a teacher and have a very short lunch break i ordered my sandwich in advance to be delivered during my lunch they were over 30 min late and when i called to tell the manager he became very combative and rude i worked at jjs while being college for over 3 years and i know how the place works this store is rude and the manager is very rudei know im going against the masses but i wont go back i ordered a concrete and i could have drank it through a straw maybe i was there on a bad day but i am not sure what all the hype is about  disappointedthis place runs the monopoly snack bar at the carondelet swimming pool and does an absolutely terrible job  they are closed as often as not the snack bar at the pool just closed oh well and when you are lucky enough to find them open they are out of 12 the menu items  management capabilities and concern for customers are clearly lacking at this placeworst krystals that i have had the misfortune to choose waited thirty minutes to get a sack of 12when we arrived at about 7pm to a crowd restaurant which is fine however the waiters just seems to ignored everyone else and not make eye contact or even greet them when i tried to approach one he kept walking away and ignoring me extremely bad service   once we got a table menus werent provided to us for 15mins until i managed to stop a waiter and asked for them i also noticed a dad and his kid was trying to get the waiters attention and he kept ignoring them for 20min before finally acknowledging them which got me in an irritable mood  finally when its time to take our orders every request we made he kept saying that theyre too busy and cannot do it he said it with a frowning and angry face like he was annoyed we asked for boba drinks and he said they cant do that either cause theyre too busy to be honest the place is not that big and it didnt look like they had so many people in the first place we ended up leaving and got sushi instead   im surprised theyre still in business with the service that they provide for me i do not care if a place have the best food in the world but if the service sucks i rather eat at mickey di ordered a grande peppermint mocha here but several people who came after me got their drinks before i did by the time i got my drink they had given me a tall instead of a grande i told the cashier and she told me im pretty sure i charged you for a tall and wouldnt remake my drink she didnt even try to find my receipt either to double check i checked my starbucks app later to see she charged me for a grande completely horrible customer servicethis starbucks took 25 minutes and 4 tries to give me and my wife a grande iced caramel macchiato and venti skim chai the drive thru line is a closed line so we were held hostage and could not drive away they kept handing us drinks that were the wrong size which is annoying but forgiveable or the complete wrong drink like why did you hand me a tall latte and try to tell me it was a grande caramel macchiato   stay awaywent for dinner and after telling the pie maker she needed to speak louder her excuse was she had a sore throat the manager had to talk to us made my order n got a pizza that was burnt on the bottom n too crunchy you only get one style thin crust they need to offer thick crust n not burn the bottom they need to take baking tips from blaze pizza better crust that isnt burnt try both n you decide my money will be spent at blazeprobably the worst customer service available at a asian establishment ive been to many so i dont expect to much to start with but this place has made even my bad experience seems ok   ordered 2 drinks off their menu and after half hour of waiting i confronted the cashier about my prepaid drinks he says hes on it but after another 5mins i see 4 drinks for other customers which were after me needless to say im getting angry after this point i was going for a refund but the line and wait was just worth ithad to convince the manager to make a turkey panini  he didnt want to at first because he was out of premade sandwiches   ridiculousemployees never have grille items always slacking at the easiest job ever how hard is iti was so disappointed with this place and i was really hoping it would be great because of the many positive reviews  it started with our waitress  she was never rude just very unenthused and it was clear she would rather not be there  then our salads came   i ordered ranch and it was awful there was no ranch flavor it tasted like sour cream that had gone bad and was runny  not a good sign when your meal starts out with a salad that i had to send back  bread was never brought to our table others had it  this was our first time dining here so maybe we were supposed to ask for it  for our entrees i ordered the pesto pasta with shrimp and scallops  the scallops were just ok not pan seared the pesto sauce wasnt bad but had a different taste that i cant quite explain but the shrimp were horribly overcooked worst flavorless chewy shrimp i have ever had  my husband had the chicken parmesan and his was overcooked and dried out  basically i had high hopes for this place and maybe it was one of those off night situations but it was overall a bad experience and unfortunately we will not be backwe saw our server twice once to order and once to bring the check what i ordered did not come as requested and i did not discover it until the person not the server had quickly walked away it was not a good experience  the burger id ordered without a bun came with breaded onions if i asked for no bun id think breaded onions would be something fairly obviously breadlike when we finally got someones attention to ask for one without any breaded onions they brought it back with the crumbs of the onions on the side where theyd been scraped off i can scrape the onions off myself if i didnt mind the breading  the salad was good thats all i can say that is positive aside from that it is loud and way too in love with being hip instead of providing good food and serviceseated around 830 after being taken to a dirty table ordered appetizers around 900 they came around 927 one of which included rice and some of the rice was hard as if someone added it after they had already started cooking rice and it was almost done we had already finished drinks which is saying a lot because my husband had the beer sampler  64 oz beers   tried to talk to mgr about appetizer  didnt get him until 940   945 when they brought out our entrees   my 17 yr old son says food was good but the service sucked  must have the patience of a saint to eat here manager says theyre going through growing pains   husband didnt get full sized beer til he  was almost finished with his dinner  my son enjoyed his creme brulee with the exception of the hard rice in the shrimp appetizer  the food was not an issue a little slow on delivery to our table no really slow to our table once we got our food our waitress forgot we existed we had to flag down whoever was walking by other waitresses waiters busboys to no avail we finally had one waitress who took pity on us and placed our drink orders we got our sodas my husbands beer still didnt come when the other waitress not ours saw we still hadnt gotten it she went back to get it i imagine she thought our server would get it after all she had her own tables to cover   i havent had service this bad since i went to  dennys in high schooli would have given this place a zero if i could went in on a saturday night hoping to try out the place ordered a beer and we were told we had to leave in two minutes since there was a wedding what anyways the waitress was very rude maybe ill try them out laterwe had been interested in going here for quite some time we finally went 2 nights ago 62216 we were greeted nicely by a hostess i would have expected it to be rally busy the place was darn near empty at 6pm we sat for awhile until our server came to our table she was not friendly nor did she do anything such as suggestions from the bar or appetizers it was kind of like what do you want i was not looking for anything fancy to drink all i wanted was a mich ultra something they do not carry my husband on the other hand was pleased with the craft beer selection it was bizarre that she put what looked to be a bill on our table it looked like someones bar tab she never explained what it was i was like why do we have someone elses bill on our table i then realized it was an example of a listing of beers with prices during our whole visit the manager sat in the office he was either playing on the computer or texting on his cell phone for an app we ordered the cracklins they were ok all it was was pork belly cut into chunks and deep fried with bbq spice sprinkled on top  my husband ordered the pork steak special 17 for a piece of pork steak that has no smoke flavor and two tiny sides i was excited that he chose creamed spinach as a side i love creamed spinach i thought it was gross i ordered the bbq nachos the cheese sauce and the nachos themselves were good i thought the presentation of such a messy menu item on a small sheet tray lined with paper was disgusting reallywho wants to take their fork to their so called plate covered with paper and scoop up a forkful of paper with your nachos  i was a little grossed out when a saw another customer pick up the shaker with bbq seasoning and bring it to his nose to smell it i wonder how often they clean those and their squirt bottles of bbq sauces we heard another server with a new table of guests talk about the craft beers and appetizers nice job on his part we seemed to be an imposition or maybe our server had something more important to be doing lastly  the cloth napkins are nice if had had a child at the table i could use the napkin and dip it in my water to wipe off a face not being a child i opted to do this in the restroom i have never seen such a dark restaurant bathroom what could be lurking in there lol anyways i planned on wiping my face in the restroom no paper towels made this difficult and disappointing we do not go out to eat often what we make at home is usually much better than what you find out plus our son had really raised the bar on smoked and bbqd meats as he is very gifted when it come to his use of the smokermeatsbbq i would have just as soon spent 70 dollars on a 3 pack of baby backs and steaks from sams or costco we would have had 56 meals out of that and excellent service hendricks we will not returnthe quality of my sandwich was the equivalent of cat food on a stale baguette only thing well made was the boba teaslightly edible is all i can say i can honestly say it is perhaps the worst taco bell ive been to and its likes 2 minutes from my house which is frustrating i only go there when i cant wait any more for some tb disappointingsuperfresh is stuck in the 1980s like the rest of havertownthe wardrobes and the chainsmoking habits of the employees are things you might encounter in a small town somewhere in the midwestthere is also a rotten vegetable odor that hits you as soon as you enter i realized my onion dip was two months expired just before i ate itphew is there a lightbulbshopping basket shortage there are hundreds of cans of coconut water but no ripe bananas i was really hoping to like this place after reading all the great reviews  however i had a really bad experience with them tonight  called in for delivery and was told 30 to 40 minutes no problem an hour and 10 minutes later i called to ask when we could expect the pizza after a five minute delay i was told the delivery guy would be here in one minute ten minutes later he finally showed up coincidentally the pizza parlor is a 10 minute drive pizza showed up cold just guessing that they forgot about me until the second call  maybe its a good pizza when it is hotthe food is very good  that is why i overlooked the horrible service on my first visit  the staff acted like their customers were a burden  one of the chefs  was napping at a table near our table  in spite of all that i did return this morning because of the food  its too bad that i did not get to eat  the waitress decided that i was not a priority  i ended up walking out after waiting at my table for 15 minutes for service  no menu no water not even a greeting  too badif you want a sub go elsewhere  night before thanksgiving 2014 i made the mistake of going to the jersey mikes in pinellas park not only was the service slow after waiting in line for 20 minutes i was informed that the store was out of bread and they had to go to another store and that theyd maybe have it in another 45 minutes no thanksi left  yesterday 12214 i went backas i walk in the door im told they are out of bread i tell them that this is the 2nd week in a row they have pulled this stunt and how the hell do they stay in business i wouldnt be surprised it this location is closed soondonna worst customer service rep ive dealt with  from my experience with safeway this location is by far the worst i cant speak for the rest of the store but the customer service desk was horrible ive been cashing payroll checks at safeway for years and have never had a problem but for some reason the customer service rep at this location donna quickly found a reason to dismiss me when i approached the service desk no one was there at first one gentleman was ahead of me when donna approached the man in front  of me pleasantly greeted her first saying  hello how are you doing very politely and enthusiastically donna responded  im okay doing way too much work than one person should have to do which seemed very unprofessional to me complaining about your job to a paying customer is in poor taste i believe after she helped that gentlemen i approached the counter and asked if i could cash my payroll check she asked have you cashed here before i responded yes many times she immediately said she couldnt cash the check because my id says im a second ii on my id but not on the check also my name is michael on my id  but mike on the check wow i understand this may be a legitimate policy but seems a little exteme i thought thats why you enter you social security number twice it confirms your identity especially since ive been cashing these same checks at safeway for about 5 years every week she completely dismissed me and made me feel like an annoyance to her i laughed and took my check back at which point i drove 5 min up the street to another safeway on tanque verde and sabino canyon and cashed my check no problem with a very accommodating clerk that was friendly and that didnt act like i was wasting her time donna youre lucky enough to have a job if youre not happy with it quit im sure theres plenty of people that deserve it and would do it happily instead of acting like their customers are a hindranceabsolutely disgusting pizza was so greasy and over priced the chicken nuggets were decent maybe because they tasted like the home bought natural ones also over pricednever again  as i stated during my exit horrible service ran out of flour so no fried food  desserts were nonexistent  no harlem sugar hill and the waitress did not offer an alternative we were told about all of this after we placed our orders  we had to request butter for cornbread three times  food did not come out together  ordered smothered chicken but got fried  ordered maccheese but got yams  salmon was dry  we had to get our own hot sauce and catsup food sat in window waaaay too long  this place needs to spend time training the service staff no one helps each other learn the art of checking on customers prebussing refreshing drinks etc  the manager was of no help he lied about the ability to split tickets  sylvia would be very disappointed i unfortunately dont see this establishment being open much longer unless they improve substantially too bad because the harlem restaurant is amazing and there is way too much competition 7415 5pmbewarerude service by their manager on sunday memorial day weekend i stood in front of the manager waiting for a tableat the doornot even a line in front of with 2 empty tables in sightit was hotand we waited and waited for a long timeafter i finally received an acknowledgement that we were waiting for a table or even there we were told we would have a longer wait due to people getting texts that their table was readyit was so hot inside as well your time and money is better spent on another cafetheir bacon bloody marys are over priced just a bloody mary with a piece of bacon in it the food is served cold by sweat dripping waiters and their food isnt cheapfrom a previous visit so i would recommend in the comparable price range of mr bs just around the corner that has class and air conditioning along with weekend music so spend your money wiselywe just left after our first visit and we feel taken advantage of my parents asked if they could have channa with their tandoori chicken they were given it in a small sauce cup alongside their order we expected there to be an extra charge but were a bit floored when our total came up to forty five dollars for three rice bowls and two sodas the two sauce cups of channa were charged as full orders and cost us almost fifteen dollars unfortunately my parents were not made aware that asking for the channa would mean being charged for another full order i could somewhat understand charging eight dollars if they were given enough for a single order but they werent even given enough for even half even then according to the menu doubling your protein shouldnt cost more than three dollars the food wasnt bad but the sour taste of what feels like dishonest business practices will linger for a long time i dont believe we will be coming backfood was okay   the service experience was what was horrible   my husband and i went there and both ordered the gyro meat   husband went first got sandwich  i went next   i said something along the lines and the same but with everything   the guy there upped to to plate with rice vs chips  said rice more flavorful etc etc  well we get food and husband gyro comes out and salmon comes out for me  tell the runner i didnt order that  well the other  individual owner or manager comes out and chews me out about how i  did in fact order the salmon  i tried to see where the confusion happened and tried to talk  but at one point he actually shushed me  he stomps off and i hear him in the back tell other guy that i ordered this dish    i get my plate  meat us good   the rice is eh would have preferred the cheaper option with chips    we go to pay and i apologize for confusion  maybe my accent saying same sounded like salmon   well he gets sassy again and says he repeated my order he didnt and people can make mistakes  never once did he apologize for his rude tone    people can makes mistakes  if he would have just said that he thought i said salmon and he was wrong then this review wouldnt be harsh  instead i was mansplained about my order shushed never apologized to  and for food that was only okay  never againfool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me  went to the place twice the first time  i went i came here to get a breakfast sandwich to see what the hype was about i ordered a breakfast sandwich with cooper sharp cheese which i paid extra for and turkey sausage   got my sandwich that was on whole wheat bread and noticed the egg was not fluffy but fried hard  the cheese was american and not the cooper sharp that i paid extra for  its deceptive on the ordering screen they show a sausage patty but give you a link cut in half on the sandwich  the sandwich is close to 5 dollars and in my opinion you could get a better breakfast sandwich from a food truck or the foodery up the street  as i was eating it i was thinking to myself i should have gotten a wrap as i noticed another person ordering a wrap  so i thought to myself maybe it was my fault i should have ordered a wrap instead of a sandwich  so fast forward to today i decided to give this place another chance and order a wrap this time  decided to add a few things to the wrap mushroom onion and green peppers extra charge thinking that it would make a nice fat wrap i was expecting the wrap to look more like a burrito and not an empanada i still had faith that it would taste good  it came cut in half and i  was disappointed to see the egg was not fluffy but fried hard and flat  the grilled peppers and onion was ok but the mushrooms tasted like they came out of a can  one plus there was quite a bit of bacon in the wrap which seemed like it was thrown in there to make up for the lack of egg in the wrap  im from california where the wraps are called burritos and the breakfast burritos are filled with fluffy eggs potatoes peppers bacon and cheese  i guess whole foods will do until i can make it back to california  i dont think i will be giving this place more more chanceim donewouldnt eat there ever again staff and manager are incompeten slow and slower and cant get an order right if their life counted on it and then to mess up a wrong order with another wrong order well need i say morezero stars is what they deservedriest chicken known to man its like chicken jerky and priceydolce is now closedlocks have been changedtry vinnies pizza or oaks italian deli around the cornerslowest pharmacy ever waited over an hour on a sunday morning for 1 script no other customers when i checked about how much longer they didnt even remember i was waiting but made eye contact several times during that hour and a half rude pharmacy cashier seemed bothered changing to cvsthird and last try here food was ice cold from reading the other comments on here it seems to be a very common complaint im done with this placehonestly if i could have given them 0 stars i would have for a place that is open for 24 hours it seems they have some major bugs to work out the cook spilled a drip pan all over the floor which ok simple mistake but then he started mopping it up and throwing the sanitizer all over the prep tables and food all this happens while the manager is cowering in the back the same cook went from the mop to his earpiece to handling our food  absolutely deplorable and unacceptable get a new manager and staff besides the woman with the short hair she was the only person trying we got our money back and decided to go hungry for the night you should be ashameda used and wrung out tetley tea bag would be better than what this over rated underwhelming place offers after sampling their tea i felt nauseous and got quite ill one can only imagine what really is in their dried out musty teas save your time and money and avoid this rip offfirst off let me say that i stopped in at 110 pm on sunday afternoon in zionsvilleindy after the lunch rush there was one couple in the restaurant if you want to call it that eating in and one car in the drive through not a busy moment  i was also the only one at the counter when i first started this horrible experience   it doesnt help the people waiting in line that there is time clockstopwatch facing the counter that let me know that i wasnt exaggerating when i say i waited for over 73 minutes for my order   i stopped in for a quick bite on the run i had a very important meeting fifteen minutes down the road at 106th  zionsville road less than 5 minutes away where there were almost 30 people waiting on me i thought id grab a quick taco eat it on the way and all would be good   nope   finally at four minutes i said i wasnt trying to be rude but i had an important meeting to get to is the food almost ready i was told almost   after seeing no one moving around by the counter i asked again if there was something else i should order that would be ready right now   after six minutes i said i needed my money back and had to go people were wating on me it was at that point that some kid stepped behind the food line and made my order i only hope that he boiled his hands after being in the bathroom or taking out the trash or wherever hed been for the past six minutes   this was absolutely ridiculous i not only will not be returning to this location but i will definitely advise anyone even thinking about going here to not go herewe had a horrific experience at this mcdonalds we went in just wanting a mcflurry and the woman working the cash register decided to ignore us for 10 minutes when we were clearly standing there waiting for help she was not friendly at all and in the end someone else had to come over and wait on us instead when she realized we had been waiting for a while she just rolled her eyes the mcflurries were ok but were not even close to filled customer service is definitely not a priority to this restaurantso darn overrated so greasy and chicken is fatty and gristle i gave it many chancesand the biscuits use to be so good now suckand all so priceynothing good but greasy fries which you get a handfulill take kfcokay its not just me    this is the most inefficient subway i have ever been to  the management really needs to get this under control  they are so slow and move with no sense of urgency whatsoeveri have never seen anything like it  it is so frustrating  also there is no quality control here  normally they have all the containers filled with the vegetables etc  at this subway  on multiple occasions mind you  the employees walked back slowly to the back room to refill their buckets  i also ordered the buffalo chicken and the meat was not sectioned off in the container so the lady nearly gave me twice the amount of meat that she should have  while you think i would be happy with this she also did that same thing with the vegetables  the sandwich was so huge i could not eat it comfortably or easily with everything spilling out  when i go to a subway i expect two things consistency and speed  its also a problem from a management standpoint because clearly they are following no protocol and wasting a lot of money    get this under control pleasenew owners have serious service issues to resolve takeout is a disaster owner and counter staff huffy please someone buy this place from themthis pizza was terrible compared to even the lowest of standards this is most definitely not the same macks pizza from down the shore do yourself a favor and dont order from hereordered a pourover since they were busy she overfilled the cone and i ended up with underextracted coffee she also didnt preheat the flask they serve the coffee in so it was also lukewarm after all this time they still dont train their employees i like some of their beans here better than the hub but the service is horrible still no good coffee in reno maybe someday maybe nameless will start using non hub beans we can only hope for salvation from bitter coffeeslowest rudest service ever every single time i keep thinking its just a bad day but it never changesthey dont honor their own posted sales prices made me wait for manager to confirm then completely disregarded clearly marked signage dishonest false advertisingthis noon time i have a bowl of noodles in phamous cafe i ate out a hair about 2 inches long i picked up and put aside on the table and go on eating then i found another hair that is as long as a foot i am so upset about the hairs noodles since i have been this pho restaurant almost once a week and always have a bowl of it i dont know what i had eaten before and what were hidden in the noodles that i ignored i pointed out the hairs issues to the manager but they are very impolite and doesnt show any sorry to me i will never be phamous cafe anymorenever again  this place is so poorly managed that we will never return  we decided to try them out tonight  theyve been open a couple weeks so theyve had plenty of time to get things in order  how hard can fast food be  apparantly very  we waited over 30 minutes for our food and when it finally arrived our order was wrong  my husband then had to wait another 10 minutes for his sandwich  the woman at the table next to us waited even longer and her entire order was screwed up  some people were waiting up to 45 minutes for fast food  as far as the food it was ok but nothing special   they have one soda fountain with one button to select your drink so there was always a line to get a drink and it came out so foamy it only filled half your cup and you had to wait a while to fill it the rest of the way  i selected a vanilla diet soda and it tasted awful  soda shouldnt be bitter  my husband had a regular diet soda which was also awful    the parking lot is a whole other problem  there is no way to back out of several of the spaces when there are cars in the drive thru so we had to wait several minutes just to get out because of course with the wait times the line wasnt moving  the parking lot is a feat in really bad engineering    great job overallsaid no ever of this blakes locationwe just ate here and had absolutely terrible service our food took over an hour to be served and only two people at a time the first plate and last plate were served over 20 minutes apart the waitstaff was unapologetic and on top of that the food was very mediocre the soup was salty one of the orders came out incorrectly our waters were never refilled  i would much rather be informed to expect a delay and wait for our food to arrive at the same timeworst service ever  its ss so i dont expect a lot in the first place but getting service is the bare minimum they could have done they seemed like they didnt have enough people working and were very slow our waitress disappeared and only showed up to give us our food i waived her down to order shakes and then didnt see her for the next 30 minutes when we decided to leave cash on the table for our first bill i would have asked someone else for help but no one was getting helped the entire restaurant was full of people looking for their server we were here for an hour and never got our shakes  i hope this review helps them get their stuff together or prevents other people from making the same mistake we didthere was a lady yelling at other employees and complaining she rolled her eyes when i asked for my orderfood seemed good but nothing went right eventually meal comped didnt eat it and left pissed off  no one seems to care here they figure you are here to gamble and not eat but still want to charge you 45 bucks for a steak  such a shame no point in returning to the casino if i cant have a nice dinnerworst cheese steak i ever hadtasteless with crappy roll and tiny size for the moneymy local pizza place makes a way better and bigger  sandwich for the same pricea lot of hype very little truth  i had heard great things about moons so i took my husband for lunch one day  they place was cavernous and absolutely nothing had been done to keep all the diner sounds from reverbarating  our sandwiches were nothing like what was described in the menu with most of the components seeming like stuff from a bag frozen chicken patties processed cheese slices mass produced buns  to top it all off the server spilled an entire soda on my husband  yes they were very apologetic and did not charge us for my husbands meal but that did not give us any reason to go back i had hoped their breakfast might be better but given what ive read here at yelp i wont be giving it a shoti hadnt had kfc in a long time and had the itch so i walked in here one day recently and got a bucket of chicken and first thing i thought was when did the buckets of chicken get so small especially for the price oh kfc still rocks so it may be worth it yes  well i got home and start eating and first thing i thought was when did kfc start tasting so nasty  maybe its just this location but no matter  it tasted awful and wont be doing kfc anymore  id rather go to publix where you get a box of much better tasting chicken where you get just as much chicken if not more  for roughly half the price  799 at publix for an 8 piece mixed box  2 breasts and theyre huge 2 legs 2 wings 2 thighs  trust me  much better option if you want some quick fried chicken where you can just grab and go  kfc  yuck  overpriced crap  shame theyve seemingly gone so far downhill  used to eat kfc all the time years ago and loved it but no morethe cashier was too busy visiting with manager and the other associate  she never greeted me and then walked away to do whatever it is she was doing while conversation and ignoring me and the others in line  she proceeds to ring me up not a single word and then proceeds to clean the floor  no receipt and me just standing there  i finally say are we done here never got my receipt  terrible service  visit on your own time ladies  to the manager who said i need to put my eyebrows on so i am not scary  your customer could care less how you look we just want friendly service and not to be ignoredi love good quality ice cream so was really disappointed with the quality of this ice cream its inexpensive for that reason   if you just want a quick sugar fix this would be a fun place but i left disappointedits a cosi there are lots of them in the area so you may think to yourself i know what im getting into youre wrong this place is terrible worse cosi ive ever been to they manage to somehow always have the worse tasting food and their employees are the unfriendliest bunch of people ive ever encountered and just in case you needed more reasons to stay away its always dirty with the most confusing food ordering system imaginable its not even a system just chaosi really wanted to like this northern liberties version too many people and not enough trucks service so slow left a food event hungry  wtf  oh and they were charging 15 to park in the usually free lotcannot even give any stars for this place after tonight i am a server bartender and have never complained once in a restaurant because i get it but i have never been treated the way i was treated tonight i understand the server was triple sat but to completely ignore us while we watch you interact with your other tables around us made us not wanting to come back to this place shame on you drew  you started out great that lasted until after you took our drink order slamming our drinks down on the table and our plates down to where it makes us jump is unacceptable  i have been here only one time before and it was great  dont know what has happened food was decent cannot complain about the all you can eat can legs unless you want more than one side when it includes unlimited sides my boyfriend never even got his original side we waited until we got the check and they magically appeared  note to management if you are going to have an all you can eat special have the proper amount of help so your patrons are treated decent   will not return ever my only night off in 2 weeks was wasted in this establishment and it cost me a lot sorry not sorry i didnt leave a bigger tip maybe u will learn better customer service skills drew   thank you for the worst evening i have had in yearsthe worst customer service ive experienced in a retail grocery store of this magnitude the products they sell are superior but expect to be treated like garbage  ive been here several times able today sent me over  no manager to speak to leave feedback on their page and get an absolutely rude response which i did a screenshot of and will be sharingi am a regular dunkin goer and this location is absolutely awful i repeated my order 4 times the guy taking my order was mumbling and kept saying they didnt have things i was ordering but then suddenly would say oh yeah we do nevermind we waited in line for 36 minutes got to the window the girl at the window stood and glared at us before opening the window we finally got out food and none of it was correct we got 3 things we didnt order and didnt get any of the 4 items we did order they charged us incorrectly and when god forbid we asked for ketchup packets and politely what took so long in the drive thru line she rolled her eyes and said were busy alrighty then wont be returningthis is one of the worst mcdonalds on ever been to its so dirty the food is horrible customer service is the pits it is one of the worst worst mcdonalds ever been into very unsanitary dont eat hereoverpriced salad was the best part of dining experience by far after appetizer  one salad and a few drinks with tip bill was 80  no problem there  however while being a paying customer and sitting outside we were asked to get up and move tables because another party had reservations still consuming our overpriced drinks mind you  the manager lady was not pleasant at all and then after we agreed to move to accomdate the more important paying customers our original sever acted like we never gave her the check receiptabsolutely appalling  as someone who works in restaurants every day trust me there are much better options nearbygreat food but the service is terrible waited 30 minutes for pulled pork just for them to come out and say they dropped our order on the floor after we decided we would just leave we tried waving down a waitress four of them walked right past us as we stood in front of the kitchen finally i yelled hey at one who was standing two feet in front of me to which she just ran back to the kitchen the service is a joke and they are only still open because its a small town with limited options also during our wait none of the tables were cleaned off and there were flies hovering all around it was pretty disgusting in itself hope this helpsmight have been a decent place but the 3 ladies working the food section were by far the rudest waitressescooksstaff wive ever encountered in any establishment  i love trying new places and hoped to order food and a drink but i literally wondered if maybe they were foreigners and didnt understand english well cause they were simply rude unsocial and ignored me when i tried to make polite conversation and order food  i just left never to returnstaff super friendly and service was good the issue was the food from the tacos burritos and the fish tacos whats described and whats delivered are two different things we live five minutes away and opened everything right away fish tacos were ice cold and i mean they seemed  out of the fridge cold menu states poblano tartar sauce and spicy slaw heated them up at home but only tasted slaw not very goodpoorly executed everything else was nearly fridge cold obviously not made to order as i was reading the other reviews after our first visit the prevailing complaint is food is cold  wed normally give any place another shot or three and considering the friendly staff and quick service wed want to go back and try again we wont be back as the menu and  food is so fundamentally flawed i cant see how it could be fixed hands down the worst meal weve had in a year or more we cant even mildly recommendeddidnt realize it took 1 hour to make and delivery a sandwich that was 10 minutes away jimmy johns should be sued for using a slogan like freaky fast because that absolutely false advertisingi went in here for an egg mcmuffin and it was made with the wrong kind of egg its not often i make in time for mcdonnalds breakfast and i was really disappointed they could have told me next ill go to another locationwith over an hour before closing this location ran out of product they did not give a time for how long it would take to make additional items they just said they were out i called another location and found out that this was not their policy and they should have just said how long it would be to prepare more items this rates as very poor customer service in a customer service heavy industrymore like dog burger  id rather eat at the sunoco on baltimore avenue  go up the street to strangeloves or ffs even 5 guysthe sign says they are open till 10pm we were there at 950 and it was closed fix your signs please or stay open till the actual closing time frame thanksthe worst odds of any casino beware my advice save your money hard rock casino in tampa is a rip off imo and now charging for parking greed at its worstbeware  we researched this restaurant because we wanted a good authentic italian restaurant website states the chef went to culinary school in italy   long story short it was horrible the veal was chewy the chicken marsala tasted like water no flavor at all it was not cooked with wine spinach manicotti was cold none of the entrees came with the sauteed vegetables the menu states the entrees come with  piccata potatoes and sauteed veggies the bread was still doughy   when the food was sent back the waitress stated the chef would be out to talk to us the waitress then returned a few moments later and stated we will cut the bill in half the chef never talked to us  we then asked what happened to the chef that trained in italy the waitress stated he relocated to nashville a few months ago however the current cook still uses the same recipes   we asked about the grated parmesan cheese mozzarella cheese and the noodles was told they dont use fresh parmesean because it would go bad they also dont make their own mozzarella or noodles even though the website says differently was a horrible experience and definitely over priced there was only one other table of people there the entire time we dined i dont recommend it at all we will hunt for another italian restaurant    on a positive note the salad was very good the mozzarella cheese sticks were good but they were the frozen kind   we were really looking forward to cannoli  and tiramisu however we were hesitate about it due to the state of the rest of the meal we asked the waitress about it and she admitted they came preprepared from the freezer so we passedworst subway ever  the staff is a joke slow as molasses and unorganized  they make your sandwich as skimpy as possible  i get the veggie allot i asked for xtra black olives and xtra jalapeos  i got 4 olives and 5 jalapeo slices i asked your kidding right its a veggie was told the owner told them to cut back again i am paying for the vegetables i now drive out of my way to avoid this joke of a franchise even though its right around the cornertried having a pizza delivered and they told me they werent going to because they were expecting a rush i asked to speak to the manager after about 5 minutes waiting the guy comes back and says i must be a good customer cause im an exception and they will deliver to me an hour later my barely average quality pizza was here not worth your timereally poorly ran location most of the staff isnt polite or knowledgeable of itemspromos i went there for the free small fry and fish when you buy a large drink deal you get for doing the survey on the back the guy working the window refused to serve me bc he said they get audited eventho i did the survey  horrible customer service and he was rude about the whole situation he must have been having a bad day  wouldnt recommend this location to my worst enemy bc they are so bad here there are plenty of better locations on the north side and west side of indy stay away from this one   wish management would step it up and hire a better staff or i dont see this one lastingthe concept of foodery is kind of cool too bad the people who work there are unnecessarily rude rude employees  i wont be backthere is so little actual organic stuff hereand its all over priced i found more organic stuff at giant in dilworthtown  just because they have dim lighting and pay classical music doesnt mean they have healthy food  once wegmans goes in next door i doubt this place will be openi recently popped in here before my nail appointment to grab a quick pick me up there was only one person ahead of me and it looked as though she was purchasing a gift card   the two baristas that were working were trying to figure out how to ring in her purchase but were having a difficult time   the customer suggested taking my order and allowing me to go first while they figured out the gift card the baristas said it was only going to be a second so i replied that i wasnt in a huge rush   10 mins later yes i was watching the clock the two people working still hadnt figured it out i sadly had to walk out i really should have said something but i was furious   i dont think i will be back to this location the lack of service teamwork and disregard for the customers was a real turn offi ordered two chicken caesar salads and im literary waiting about two hours for it to arrive not a phone call check up or anything fuck axis pizza im over this shit business completely horrible experiencethe food is great the service is spot on   but i refuse to come back  the place smells like fartscould be the worst mcdonalds that i have ever been to service wise  i waited in drive thru for over 5 minutes and didnt move   went inside because there were only two people in line   no one was taking orders  an employee said the counter girl was in the bathroom   there were several people just standing around   one person said she couldnt help us because she hadnt clocked in yet  when i got to order i chose a 3 but still had to wait for fries   i asked for my burger and drink so i could leave   the staff couldnt understand me leaving without my fries  i will never return to this mcdonaldswanted to purchase another happy meal toy for my daughter  wasnt allowed  mcdonalds let you do it  just saying too busy of a place anyway  wont be backabsolutely vastly overrated  first you need to know this place received a score of 83 in its most recent health department rating  thats a real concern  second it was overpriced and beyond the pancakes the food was mediocre at best  much better breakfast at noshville and fidos which are located on the same street  fidos is right around the corner  this is a tourist trap obviously gravytraining on its past reputation  i doubt any important people from music row come here unless they have very low standards for quality and pricewe came with 6 people at 858 pm on saturday all young men working completely hating life being here and it was apparent we were bothering them  having dinner here all the toppings were out  we were told i hope this is ok for the half scoop of white rice because  they werent making anymore  they are open until 11 pm  they have an hour and a half until closing  spicoli is at the register looks completely high  is on the phone facetimimg  i would be completely livid if this was my company  the guy at the registers hair is hanging out over the ingredients  terrible terrible service and terrible foodfood take fover for orderhalf ass on service the food not so goodafter driving by and noticing this place was finally opened i just had to try it and i oh so wanted to like it but when i walked in there was a young black girl and kind of older hispanic looking lady behind the counter no one said hello or acknowledged me at all i was the only customer there so its not like they were busy or anything the young girl was sitting on a stool and the other lady just standing there i picked up a menu and started reading it then asked if they worked there and if the place was opened they finally opened their mouths i ordered the whiting platter a crab cake and a container of seafood salad while waiting for my food i saw that they sell king crab legs for a whopping 18 a lb why on earth would anyone pay that astronomical price what they can get them seasoned steamed and delicious at giant foods for around 10 a lb the fried fish was ok nothing great about it the crab cake was a joke it had very very little crab in it and a bunch of whatever the filler is they use not at all worth buying the seafood salad was imitation crab meat and salty mayonnaise and thats it also not worth buying based on my experience i dont think this place will be around for long i know i wont be going back im all about supporting local businesses but this place is not worth it at alli have never in my life had such a bad experience with a bartender indiana city was one of our four stops on a brewery tour throughout indy when we got to this stop it was awfully crowded which i was excited about because that means the beer must be good i go up to the bar and ordered two beers pay for them tipped and watch the bartender go help another group of 57 other people which is fine and probably more efficient once the 57 people order their beers she goes to the tap and starts filing up glasses but doesnt fill up the beers that i ordered she then goes to the opposite end of the bar and starts taking more orders when she walks back my girlfriend asked if she was still getting our beers and the bartender said ugh im sorry we are a little busy tonight she then goes and gets our beers and then tries to charge me a second time for them when i told her that i already paid she said i am sorry i didnt realize you were the only people at this bar   full disclosure the bartender did refund us our money but i wont be return due to the poor customer servicehorrible customer service placed a very simple order  the cashier was so confused then took 5 minutes to try to correct the order that needed a manager to void the transaction then the card reader wasnt working asked her to manually enter the card  she looked at us like we had 3 heads each take the piercings out when working in the food industry  learn to do your job this was the absolutely worse service weve ever seenthe pizza is consistently good but unfortunately the service at this location is consistently subpar what is the point of giving me an estimated pick up time if you are always at least 1520 later than the given time my current visit is at 24 minutes late parking in broad ripple is hard to come by and its not really worth the effort to come to hot box id rather deal with traffic downtown and go to the georgia street location or any one of a dozen other pizza placesmaybe it was an off day for them at this establishment maybe  upon arriving for lunch we were immediately seated  the server took our drink order then came back 4 times in three minutes to see if we were ready to order  the menu is large and there is a wide selection  my friend ordered the hot pot special i ordered a number 62 which was a spicy meat soup  upon receiving the food i was excited to give this stuff a try  the broth in my soup was ok the meat that was in it was lunch meat slices  the was also zero spice to this soup  my friend said his meal was very bland and had to add a lot of the sauces on the table to flavor  i do not believe that i will be backbought family pack of chicken breasts here with an expiration date a week away opened it up two days later and it was horrible smelled spoiled so we had to toss it not worth the 10 to get 8 people sickwe bought a groupon we were told to pick 5 items out of the freezer everything looked freezer burned  old we were right ended up throwing it all away the place was also very dirty lookingwould not recommend if u have a party of more then 5 mt laurel will not allow u to have tables pushed together celebrating a friends achievements really come onmy first time trying this place and i will never return weve had catering from here for many many meetings and it has always been yummy so when i had to grab lunch on the go as most grad students do i thought this would be a good spot   to begin i stood for about 5min no one else waiting in line before someone acknowledged me so i could order i ordered a pesto chicken sandwich no changes or substitutions i go to pay and after a few minutes an employee places the sandwich on the counter and gestures to me i ask pesto chicken to which he replies yes i grab my carrotssandwich and run off only to discover after walking about a mile to work that i was given the wrong sandwich if i didnt find the smell of tuna passionately disgusting and it was a turkey sandwich instead i might have just eaten it but im sitting here now nauseous from the smell without a lunch and out 9   i highly doubt i will get a refund and i will just give this sandwich to the sweet homeless woman who sits near my building only positive outcome is that she will get a warm lunch todaywould give no stars if i could  beware  stay away never seen an establishment that doesnt honor the prices on their website and has an owner that says he doesnt care if we come back or not  had a party of five and none of us will step another foot in his door  how rude and i think the owner loves being this way and truly does not care  weve seen it more than once so shame on us trying this joint again  they also held our food for an hour which we thought was typical for such an arrogant you know what  we are all volunteers and had a meeting to attend so we were kind of stuck to stay and not leave right then and there  we tried to make the best of it until the owner made sure he was rude  felt bad for the staff  we rewarded the waitress as it was not her faultwellbeen going there since it was pennys for over the last 3 years not the best bbq but it was close and cheap so i went there probably 4 times a month a few weeks back i placed a pick up on a sunday had a beer while i waited bill was about 17 or 18 bucks generously tipped 8 bucks cause i am a manager in the business as welli get to my destination and open the box up to the most disgusting thing ive ever seen first of all i oredered pulled pork which this was not itbut i was starving so i dug init was nothing but huge chunks of fati called in and told em and they said oh thats our beef absolutely disgusting  so they tell me theyll replace it i make the call today and they tell me the person i spoke with had been let go and so they wouldnt help memy friends stopped coming with me cause they said it was disgusting my family wont go with me for the same reason but i continued to go once a week alone cause it was like i said close cheap and a neighborhood establishment  but now they have lost me as wellgood luck guys bad food and mishandling your customers will give you the same fate pennys had psthe plan to start there for a bday gathering are now definitely off the tablethis location is a joke and the management is the punch line you know we always say how this place reminds of us of the cooker i am thinking they will soon remind us a lot of the cooker when their own staff runs them into the ground and they file bankruptcynice place but the service was so so slow we were the only group in there none of us ordered anything crazy and it was over an hour wait i will never come here again there are better places in town for pizzathis place is the worst  ordered 3 times  the first time we ordered breakfast and they said they didnt delivery until 1100  that order was canceled  second time they didnt have tuna they didnt have spinach wraps  the entire order had to be changed  third time and last time we ordered the restaurant called and said they could not locate the delivery person and that our food was just sitting at the restaurant  worst customer service ever  they should close for eververy disappointed in the service and food at the goleta location today i had never tried innout and after waiting over twenty minutes in the drivethru for a single order being asked if i wanted ketchup and answering yes then receiving none and then getting home to find that my coke was essentially soda water and the fries were completely nastydont think i will be eating there again it seemed that the young woman in the drivethru was more interested in flirting with her coworker than she was getting orders correctand in a timely manner i know there had to be fifteen cars waiting in lineand it wasnt lunch time that is totally and completely ridiculous especially for the lackluster foodwhere do i start id give this  stars if it were an option  my daughter and i paid 42 for dinner mac n cheese that was cold gritty and soupy she was hungry after dance so she ate my very lackluster fettuccine alfredo overdone pasta runny sauce and less chicken than 12 a breast would amount to add to this miserable food the equally miserable servicehad to ask for our drinks numerous times and we were told oh sorry we couldnt find you oh heavens seriously we were 1 of 2 tables on the patio and 2 families inside its not that difficult never again i support local but not when a restaurant has slipped so far down the slope of poor foodservice that i have to ask for my money backon mac n cheese live and learnnot sure whats so special about this place ive been there twice the first time the service was good the second time the cashier obviously did not want to be there which isnt a huge deal but ok i paid 16 dollars for cookies and 2 small ice creams i could understand if the cookies were something special but honestly ive had better cookies at frys how is your whole business model based around cookies and there is absolutely no creativity in the cookie choices the premium cookies have some flair but maybe try something other than chocolate this place is way overpriced and not even that good im not wasting my money there againso considering this is right after hurricane irma and we know this place was packed we ordered one chicken sandwich with fries and have been waiting for over and hour when theh told us itll take about 45mins we ordered 2 cokes which were given to us in super small plastic cups that you can only take two sips out of everyone else has gotten their food and we are still waiting an hour and 15mins later it also took our bartender 20mins to take our order while she was talkkng to a group of people sitting next to us for about 10mins or so i am also a server and i am very aware of how crazy it could be with a place full of hungry customers but i always attend to my customers on time especially under the circumstances no one has checked on us in the past hour we tried getting the attention of a server which completely blew us off and never came back needless to say we wont be coming backif i could give it zero stars i would stopped in there after the parade thinking it was a good spot to eat when the parade was going on there was a lot of people eating outside so i figured it was good we went during brunch which was good who doesnt like a good brunch the server came right over to take our drink order which was good then they came back for are order fine it took close to an hour for us to receive our food there had to be at least 10 or more staff working to me they seemed more concerned with the people eating outside then inside a group of people left because of not being served miraculously when i asked where our food was it showed up the server told us it takes longer to cook because it is brunch how long does it take to make eggs i would not go back its a shame it has a nice setting to it but service was horrendouswas hoping to have a nice meal with my husband and kid and waited so long that we ended up taking the food home to eat it  the restaurant was hardly full so i doubt the kitchen was in the weeds  we opened our togo boxes when we got home and were even further disappointedneedless to say we will not be going backthis starbucks sucks i was in the drive threw line for what feels like forever when only like 4 cars are in front of me i do not know what takes so long but ive never been in a slower starbucks line in my lifeafter ordering a boxful of pastries  another container of sweets we needed an extra plastic bag to split things up in our group the lady rudely refused to give us one ive never been refused a cheap plastic bag where ive given my patronage dont even try to ask for a double bag if you wanna get mean eyes plenty of good bakeries that dont do this but i guess if youre already successful you dont necessarily need to make your customers happy anymore and perhaps get a bit greedy like termini bakery where you try to hold on to every penny shame on you with so many other great bakeries in the neighborhood forget this place   pastries are good but nothing special there are many wonderful bakeries who make similar things the flavors and cakes are well made but standard in flavor typical cannoli and cakes   really at this point youre just looking for a good atmosphere with good people and vibes and this place wasnt it sadlast night our neighborhood had a power outage so i went to otb the beer was cold the nachos and salsa were tasty the bartender friendly and they had a ballgame on it was a good start  my mistake was ordering food i am a big fan of fish otb had fish tacos so i ordered the entree for dinner it looked okay when it came out the beans and rice were on a separate plate and were watery but passable the tacos were another story both the fish if it was fish and the shells were terrible they tasted what i imagine cardboard must taste like dry and flavorless very disappointing  an employee asked how it was and i was honest the employee said put to some sauce on the tacos i told the employee that it came with two sauces i had tried both and it still was very bad that was the end of the conversation  if your power goes out and you want you want beer chips and baseball otb is the ticket if you want a tasty dinner go somewhere elsewent there for breakfast sat at bar and waited almost an hour for food got tired of waiting and walked out waitress didnt have a clue when asked about food wont be back with all the good reviews i guess we came on a bad night sat at the bar and with the bar servers right in front of us still had to ask to be served after almost 10 minutes the attitude was bad and a real turn off had our drinks and decided not to eat because we didnt want to put up with it may try it again since the reviews seem ok but well seekeep driving past this place horrible food with cold french fries the iced tea was a day old at least my wife ordered hot tea and it was warm at best the portions are large but the quality is not good unsatisfied customer who will never returnmy recommendation is forget this place and buy a marie callendar frozen pie at walmart and bake it yourself to have a better less expensive warm pie to serve my sugar pie is overrated and is the most expensive pie i have ever paid for which was definitely not worth it clearly the other reviews written are from zionsville residents who are just being nice to support this bakery in the town but i would rather grab a pie from marsh or meijer that pay 4 times more just because you get a pie in a glass dish in a thick cardboard box the crust is so thick and over cooked that you cant even cut a nice slice out of the dish without the thick crust crumbling all over the place the pie is okay its fruit with some extra cinnamon nutmeg sugar and lemon juice to give a little more flavor the owner is pretty arrogant and doesnt want to hear any complaints about her pie i basically paid 25 for a nice glass dish because the pie was barely eaten i was excited to bring a nice good pie to our family get together because of the reviews i read and i was so embarrassed when not one family member had anything good to say about it to the point where no one else would even try it at that point i tried a couple other slices of different pie when i picked up my pie and couldnt believe even just a slice is over 350 it was okay but definitely not worth 350 this pie place will be around for a little while because its so overpriced that the pie sales she makes well over pays for her to keep this business running but i definitely dont see this place lasting more than a couple more years word will get out as i have already started to here people talk and eventually the majority of the business this place will get is just from the restaurants that may order from them trust me save your money and buy a frozen pie at the grocery store and it will make for a better mealworst breakfast ever small portions uncooked grits and waitress forgot our toast didnt receive it until we were ready to go wont be coming backrude family owns  father is the worst  too expensive the air conditioning is never on because hes too cheap  they charge extra for credit purchasesdangerous place to shop at night manager turns off half the lights completely darkens the produce section the employess are unhappy and get hurt on the job re lack of light had to use cell phone flash light to see in places their offerings are wonderful but the poor attitude and the darkend aisles are scary stay open or stay closed but dont treat people this way i may never come back i have been there previously with great results but tonights visit was really beyond the pale workers dont want to engage with customers when they are asked for assistance seriously why stay open shop rite acme and fresh grocer the old pathmark are close by sadive been here twice first experience was nothing to write home about i probably wouldnt have ever gone again if it wasnt for a friend insisting we for lunch im sure hell never ask to go there again sushi was hot not warm hot i found a staple in my sushi which i ordered off the menu and he found a lovely little green inch worm crawling around on his plate from the buffetnever againhave you ever eaten food from one of those sketchy freddy krueger looking gas stations in the middle of bfe new jersey you know the places where you just know you cant make it out of there without at least a touch of something that will make your belly swim around the stink tank for a couple of days well if you want that same experience but without the drive or risk of loss of life this place has got you covered   completely average yet very dry cheesesteak with a very nice wait staff that refused to provide us any water with our meal enjoyi cannot speak for the french presss coffee because my wife and i did not continue our visit for long my wife was very excited to show me santa barbra as she is from ca my wife is handicapped and we walked a long time today and unbeknownst to us my wifes motorized wheelchair suddenly lost power i had to push the 600 pound chair until we could find a place to charge for a while we rolled into the french press and didnt receive a warm welcome i very politely asked if we can purchase a coffee and charge our chair they were very quick to say there was nothing they could do and they dont give access to outlets to the public or apparently even paying customers never in my life have i seen a coffee shop so stingy they eyed us down as we walked out the door im sure they have great coffee and we would have definitely got one if we didnt have this experience however we will not be returning i hope they can fix their customer service issues soontried 3 weeks in a row to go 730 closed door says open til 9 but i just snuck in at 727 and they were cleaned out the less than pleasant woman working there said they close at 730 every night and she wasnt even nice about it wont go backwhen i presented an entertainment coupon and met all the coupon requirements they still tried to find knit picky excuses that were not listed on the coupon to try to get out of honoring coupon i had to threaten to return the take out food before they gave in and they still were nasty  and then the pastrami was full of grissel and fat the french fries were cold greasy and limp the chicken breast was dry  do not eat there   send a message to restaurants that do not treat their customers with respectwe visited this location while shopping in hyde park and it was pouring rain there was no slip mat at the front door and i was the first person to walk in the door i fell so hard and slipped on the wet concrete no warning sign and the entire store looked at me they didnt offer to help me or at least a free coffeeslowest service ever  and the snoballs werent nearly as good as hansens or plum stthis was our firstand lasttime at blakes lotaburger for a number of reasons  when we arrived the place was packed parking was at a premium but we wanted to eat in so we finally found a place to park there was a long line inside and it was moving very slowly we were on line for approximately 18 minutes before we finally made it to the counter once there we placed the order wed had plenty of time to think through we both ordered the lota combo he asked for nothing on his burger except cheese and onions when asked if they had any other sauces for the burgers like maybe 1000 island they did not i have gluten issues and asked if they have glutenfree buns they do not i ordered mine bunless the combo comes according to the menu with a large drink and a large fries their large drink is something like 30 ounces but their large fries is smaller than a regular size at certain large chain restaurants the price was fairly reasonable no real complaint there  we went off and found one table to sit down at to wait for our food the dining room is far too small for the numbers of people wanting to check out this new restaurant that may not be a problem for long however there are no salt or pepper shakers no available napkins on the tables or in the dining room  there was a young man running orders out to the tables and it was at this point that i realized how backed up they really were our order number was 844 the runner was bringing out orders in the low 830s people who had already found tables before we entered the restaurant were just getting their food at this point wed already been in house approximately 25 minutes it took approximately another 15 minutes to get our food when we got it our first disappointment was the fries not that they were unpleasant they were not particularly hot more along the line of lukewarm and they could have used a bit more salt when he opened his burger there was cheese but no onions he had to go to the counter for it and wound up with the equivalent of the small round of onion the patty was thin and dry and we were both disappointed at the fact it was only one patty the picture next to the lota combo clearly shows a double patty burger when he asked about it he was told they have had a large number of complaints about that  over all the experience was far less than all the hype had led us to expect we wont be going back if we want a good burger well go to graze across the streetyuck yuck and yuckeloquent i knowi went to visit my mother in florence and thought id pick up cheesesteaks on the way there man was i dissappointed the order was wrong the rolls and meat dry and my parm had an itsy bit of suace on it and while im at it i am not a fan of a ton of high school kids running amuck and bsing with the staff because it obviously affects their concentrationnot impressed i had ordered a birthday cake with very specific instructions for the decoration the cake didnt even come close to what i had asked for and the baker decided to add her own design which was just horrible the writing was terribly written got past the exterior and tried it the worst cake i have ever eaten i would not recommend ordering a cake from here the worst part is that i was picking this up the day before the birthday and was essentially stuck with it i would have been better off with a birthday cake from a local grocery storelong wait and when it was finally our turn some girl took her friends who were behind us first had to wait another 5 minutes with two small hungry children food was wrong fries were awful kids were done eating before my husband even got his food back server i am hoping was just new she was horrendous and both my husband served and bartenders and are as understanding as we are not the manager seemed preoccupied with his servers and chatting while tables were dirty and people waited for just the servers to get to the tables let alone needing boxes which we never got and left our half of our food after it came back to our table cold too server walked by numerous times without asking anything while we had empty drinks and empty plates than us being optimisticor naive our girls wanted shakes terrible terrible mistake 20 minutes later and the 1 guy in front of us we had 4 shakes was still waiting on his to top it all off the cups were filthy sticky and just gross i wouldnt have paid for them but kids were tired and we had just been worn down with our experience we just got them cleaned off and left i wish these things had negative starsreally decent sandwiches  great hummus but be prepared to be frustrated at every turn  weve eaten here 4 times and will likely returnmoaning our way through itthis place is awful went to get an unsweet tea with orange flavoring i used to get is all the time in texas and the flavorings were unsweetened too my drink came out tasting like sickly sweet cough syrup so they either artificially sweetened the flavoring or added the flavoring to sweet tea by mistake i reported that the drink wasnt what i expected and the manager acted as if i didnt know what i was talking about but said she would get us a regular unsweet tea we waited several minutes called for service again and were ignored decided it wasnt worth the trouble and went to mcds for a large unsweet tea sonic never againi love the wing lovers meal  it is what i eat at el pollo loco  rarely is it not availabletoday im sick and that is what sounded good  not only did the restaurant say no they couldnt have it today but when i asked again they said enfatically no  if there is an item guest enjoy then the restaurant should plan on having enough to provide to their guests  off to kfc i gothis was our first and last trip to el pollo loco the person taking the order didt understand that i wanted 5 chicken avocado tacos these are advertised on their website and they are advertised on their commercials i got to the drive up window and showed the employee a picture of the taco from their website that included a description of the taco she had to call over the manager and they both looked at it like it was something from outer space they seemed to finally understand and filled my order when i got home the tacos were all ice cold 5 minutes to my home the chicken was filled with tendons and even pieces of bone there was no avocado in three of the tacos and the two that had avocado was just a small amount hidden at the bottom of the tortilla there were 3 containers of cilantro sauce and 2 containers of pico de gallo keep in mind this is for 5 tacos they charged me an outrageous amount of money for 5 chicken avocado tacos which only 2 of them really were needless to say there are better fast food restaurants that serve what you order and especially know what is on their menus save your money and dont go here for a chicken avocado taco or you will be loco for surei swear to god they have messed up my coffee 5 times in a row its like a joke to me now lol idk why i dont learn my lesson i have never had one good experience here the customer service sucks and you can just tell that the employees dont give a crap about their jobs its pretty sad that this location is 5 min from my home but i will definetly be going elsewhere nowi order online and they forgot to give my mother a soda that i order and manager claimed it was my mothers fault when she didnt even place the order when it is the employees responsibility to give out the order correctly  the very unprofessional manager also hung up on my mother when he was asked what his name was i was very unsatisfied with the poor customer service  skills and lack of management skillswowserver couldnt have been less engaged  had to be asked for cup for coffee  no bacon available  ordered breakfast sandwich on everything bagel and opened container to find plain  if you are going to do breakfast at least make an effortthis is honestly the worst store ive ever been to my entire life i really thought about it too and yea its the worstfood was horrible flies all over the place it stinks in his place never again nevermy husband and i each had smoothies and we both give a 1 star maybe try the ice creamour family has been going for years and after the disappointment today we wont be back there was not much on the buffet and what was there was old and coldwe went out for brunch on sunday morning looking forward to a stellar omelet  we arrived and there were only two other tables occupied  the restaurant got busier and we observed 4 other tables had received food when they had arrived at least 10 to 15 minutes after us  when we finally got the servers attention we asked about our food  he told us that they were experiencing a rush  we reminded him that we had arrived well before said rush  he said he would check on our order and eventually came back with more coffee informing us our food was on its way  much later still no food and we asked a different server who was also going to check into it  we finally left after a 45 minute wait with no food or explanation for the deplorable lack of service  we have patronized this restaurant in the past experiencing reasonable food quality and variable service with a side of arrogance  arrogance is never palatable especially when the service is poor  we will not return  zero service zero food and zero stars
