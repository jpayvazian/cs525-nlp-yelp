knowledgeable and friendly and i had a great time  i will definitely be back to the fried chicken and green salad is great but the fries are fried and dont look authentic  the server was very kind and helpful  however i wish there was a way to customize his menu to suit my own taste so i have to go back  the meat is cooked very flavorful and tender and the sauce is a little dry to methe chicken is not quite as tender as i think and it is still quite a bit too much for me   the only thing that is a little disappointing is that the staff isnt even trying to help you out and you can make a large donation to help fund the server   they are not very organized in terms of the things that need to be done  their food is very good and i will return to the chicken if the server is happy", "i would
