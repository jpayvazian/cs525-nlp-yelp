my absolute favorite cafe in the city their black and white latte is probably the best ive ever had not too sweet and just the right amount of foam soups are always really good even for nonsoup people and theres just a lot of space to do work the noise level is perfect the music is at a perfect level and i always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs ill keep giving them my business for as long as i canholy smokes  actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custardare you kidding me why hasnt this become a huge sweep the nation treat   the best part was the chunks of pie crust like finding a diamond inside another diamond super yummygreat burgersfries and salad  burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor  this location is very quaint they only have outdoor seating  friendly staff  street parking as well as parking lot in the backgreat staff always helps and always nice always clean and huge store size stays stocked with everything you need the staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagelwhat a great addition to the funk zone  grab a bite grab some tastings life is good right next door to the santa barbara wine collective in fact it actually shares the same tables  we had a fabulous savory croissantmy brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in ended up staying and having a few while playing their nintendo 64 super smash brothers which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons its a great place with good food and genuinely nice people should be a staple in the northeastwe were a bit weary about trying the shellfish company on the wharf as more often than not many places like these see cannery row monterey feast on a captive audience and provide substandard fare at high prices  however emboldened by the perennial good reviews on yelp we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out the place is small so definitely plan ahead you will have to wait so either you know just do so or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours luckily our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off  the special was the local rock crab  25 for 3 lbs of california rock crab salad and your choice of soupchowder after taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out the wife and i both opted for it as it looked awesome    the saladchowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each so it was a good start as much as i liked the chowder however the shrimp bisque the wife ordered was amazing so i would recommend that going forward   but enough of prattling on about side dishes the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked juicy buttery chunks of white crab meat await you just a few cracks away while the rock crab shells are pretty thick once cracked they splinter and separate easily a good sign they are cooked to perfection the rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what i felt to be the least amount of work youre going to do for crab king or otherwise   we were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value devouring the rock crab at sbsc turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip i think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeedive only had the cannolis here but they are awesome theyre freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal not too sweet its perfect if you like cannoli if you dont think you like cannoli you should definitely get one from termini brosafter living in the stl area for way over 10 years now i am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that i ate here for the first time just a few weeks ago i am ashamed because its a st louis tradition and remorseful because i missed out on it for somanyyears   this place is amazing what is not to love its a factory where you can get a tour fridaysunday noon5pm on the hour theres a shop bar and dining area they also host many event with live music on the weekends its fun to just kind of wander and look around  dont worry youll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine the beer is of course amazing the hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker like myself additionally the food is homegrown and damn good i had the pizza recommendation from my server and it was really spectacular though im admittedly a pizza connoisseur so i enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably p my date had a bison burger which was also really good   more fun info the service is great i think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people like tattoo parlor staff which i support the quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery   it is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality it is worth it i will go again and again and you probably should tooi had the pleasure to meet with ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward thanks girliethis is one of the busiest chick fil as ive seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service i seriously dont know how they can be so quick and great all the time one of my favorite placessweet spot in the waterline came for some live music with friends on saturday very cool best local beer in town by far seems like the concept is a few notches up from fig mountain definitely prefer topa even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the nook restaurant and walk two feet into lama dog which is part of the waterline i love iti first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a franklin local  he recommended that we brave the line and try one of nashvilles best breakfast spots  he was right  holly cow this place kicked butt and we didnt even have to wait in line we were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress   i had this super savory corn pancake with bacon salsa and sour cream so good this place will always be a stop when i get back to the southnot sure why it took until now for us to find this place we started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic a friend recommended lobster haven and i checked it out online looked like a type of place we would eat at in massachusetts when we visit family we were not disappointed service was great fast and very friendly huge selection of all of the favorites you have to visit this place if you want authentic new england seafood you can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourselfyes i love this place maple street patisserie is the bombcom ive never been disappointed best blueberry muffin ive ever had in my whole entire life delicious breakfast and lunch spot they also do specialty cakes so swing by during mardi gras and grab a king cake also the owner ziggy is the man hes always running around working crazy hours to make all these scrumptious baked goods cant beat this place i love this place  i have been coming here for a few years now  its a little funky and i would never order say the escargot for safety reasons but when it comes to lots of saki great rolls and mountains of rice and sashimi this is the way to go  young atmosphere loud dance music and sakii cannot even believe someone gave this place one star heres the scoop they have the best cannoli in the city terminis are no where near as good and isgros is far too hyped up for the quality potitos is my go to for cannoli i wouldnt even think about going anywhere else im there every xmas eve and will be for the rest of my days i stood in line for isgros for two hours this year for a tirimisu i walked right into potitos and picked up my bambino cannoli stuffed cannoli its as good as it sounds trust meeat here at least 2 times a week servers are always friendly and the food is amazing i never leave disappointed  always leave with a full stomachlove in n out theres just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes  what can i say 4 patties animal style bruhthis small little donut bakery is located in one of hermitages oldest shopping centers   i can imagine baking donuts is a hard job let alone running the businessits one of those jobs that starts in the wee hours of the morning so that the donuts are freshly made daily  yeu the owner serves not only your common popular donuts but he also serves donuts with bacon on top apple fritters pigs in a blanket breakfast pastries and  kolachesin addition to these yummy treatshe makes doughssantsthey are what seems to be a scandalous marriage of a donut and a croissant need i say more yeahyou heard me a doughssant worth the trip just to eat one of these   prices are considerably cheap the doughssants are only 199 each the regular donuts are about 60 each   these sweet donuts are my favorite treats to buy for my kids school teachersand they love them   coffee also served herewe have had a blast to each event weve been to  weve been to concerts and basketball games and other were a lot of fun  the food is really good also  a lot of local favorites are offeredlove this store  who doesnt  the salad bar is fresh and they have all types of ethnic food to try  njoyfantastic sliders perfect size that you can try more than one  fried chicken slider blt slider monte cristo and cuban were all fantastic  now for donuts to golove this little shop so much for so many reasons first off whenever im on my way to sweet divas i can smell the spices wafting from this little inviting shop second they have such a large range of spices that you can smell taste a little and purchase yes theres a large overwhelming variety of spices but fear not their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs over the years ive purchased many items from here and i can attest that they do last a long time about a year year and a half including some stuff i use often i see all kind of specialty salts for example onion salt celery salt as well as sugars and powders lavender vanilla sugar vanilla bean powder their products even seem to taste fresher i can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what i can get at a dollar store for example the prices arent too bad and they last long my three bottles pictured cost about 19 but that will last a good year so its worth it to melots of improvements to this place much more comfortable environment now  the chairs could be a bit more comfortable as itd be nice to sit through an entire football game otherwise this place has really improvedmy mother aunt and myself went on this walking tour of ybor with stops for good food  what a nice time  our guide  raymond was very knowledgeable and friendly   it was about 3 hrs long  we passed that 3 hr mark because we were sidetracked a few times and chit chatted quite a bit lol  we learned great details and background about the early days of tampa the culture people and ybor in general  very informative along the way we stopped for food tastings  everything was great  especially the stone soup company cuban sandwich  i would recommend everyone to go on this tour  visiting or lived here for years this is a fun adventure  and for the step counters we chalked up over 5000 steps  it will help offset all the wonderful calories you take in on the tour hahalove this bakery great breakfast sandwiches coffee and donuts my friend and i love coming on weekend morningsthis place always delivers yet another great year with hayrides pumpkin picking and lots of other activitieslove it here their sips mocha is my goto staff has always been so nice absolutely love that they have a drive thru too helps not to unload my kiddos oh and their cakes are amazing tooi have been a fan of chateau la vin for a few years it has been fun to watch the place evolve at first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables now it has been transformed into a wine bar he offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver he had two guys playing music he offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge my friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well he does have a few tables out in front this is a great placegreat store insane selection incredible customer service  wish they could come to ft mcmurray   so worth the wait the crepes are amazing i also loved the grits which is rare tried my hubbys pancakesawesomefrom the second you walk in the door youre greeted by the adorable woman at the counter it seems if you come in here more than once a week shell know youre name but i havent been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic  my most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches which are served all day i particularly enjoy veg sausage w havarti on an everything bagel i could actually go for one right about now ive also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant everything always taste fresh they are priced really well  i think my favorite bagel sandwich i mentioned is 209299 cheaper than wawa the people at the deli are super helpful offering menus if you cant read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want  dont forget to grab a really great snack too while youre there they have amazing chocolate bars an incredible drink case tons of chip varieties and those addictive hichew candies in every flavor  i know ill be back here who doesnt like fast  delicious  attentive servicethe depot burger is so delicious along with the shishito peppers perfect food perfect atmosphere perfect drinksi moved from chicago to philadelphia over a year ago  everybody here raves about the restaurants but i have yet to find many that deserve five stars or even four  this is the best restaurant i have eaten in in philadelphia    tahini and bread  arrived at the table and i thought hum plain but im hungry  they must put crack in that tahini  i wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog  the bread is excellent too  i love a menu with many organic meat choices  how often can you order an organic beef shishkabob  it was superb  the meat done perfectly the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch  the purslane salad tasted like i was eating a plant in the middle of a garden  it is not often that i dream about a salad but i do dream about this one  my husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice  i wont begin to describe the flavoring it is beyond my culinary vocabulary  we asked what spices they use and in addition to traditional zatar they use their own blend of spices  i dont even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again  i was so full but ate dessert none the less which i usually dont do  but when a diner is this good i had a feeling the desserts would be too and i just needed to find out  pistachio creme brulee  it could have come out over the top but no indeed  it was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard  heaven heaven  our service was superb  the squeezed us into a last minute friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us  given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly  then my husband left to go to the restroom the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table  do i care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal  not really but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained    my eating out plan for philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so i can frequent this expensive though appropriately priced restaurant  kudos to the chefthis is the place for authentic indian street food ive been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri pav bhaji vada pav deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki dabeli kulfi and more everything was made exceptionally well  i regret not having found this place soonerbest smoothies in the whole world and fresh bread is amazing very knowledgeable staffi stopped by bell meade during a recent visit to nashville the best way for me to describe my experience is to say that the next time i go to nashville i will go out of my way to make sure i return to bell meade  on my travels i tend to stop from time to time to see if i can find specific bourbons that may be out locally at this time of year i did not expect any great finds because many of the items for which i look have their annual release later in the year so its a surprise to find any of them on the shelf for example elmer t lee is a favorite of mine so it was one that i asked about  despite the fact that i walked away without elmer t i still had a great time i enjoyed a few tastes at the tasting bar and even better i had a great conversation with max he is one of the reasons i will return  i did walk out with a bottle of tennessee whiskey cream that is not sold locally and there was a bottle on the shelf that i have not seen locally that i need to investigate as i said i will return and a five star rating from me should say at alli love trying fresh seafood on piers wharfs and seaside markets most of the time it is a disappointing experience but this place is not the food is legitimately fresh and prepared well the gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of natures beautiful sundae i have been here before but ordered the wrong thing cioppino that wasnt very good when i had it a couple of years ago here   we came for a late lunchearly dinner on a monday even at 4pm  there was a wait we waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor while it wasnt ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses the view was worth it   we got the local crab special which was a steamed 3lb crab served with a salad and soup for 26 i thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge delicious and meaty the garden salad was fresh as simple as it was the lobster bisque we got was pretty good the other options were caesar salad and clam chowder they topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter yum  we also got the fried platter of shrimp oysters calamari and scallops for 1295 it came with cole slaw onion rings tartar sauce and cocktail sauce as greasy of a meal as this made it was one of the better fried platters ive had anywhere the seafood was just really fresh including the sometimesfeared fried oyster   the ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it we did because it was hot out she was just friendly and good at her job  five stars for her  by the time we left at about 6 there were so many people waiting make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there the restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires i parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier it was free on a monday late afternoonthe food at ghinis is just delicious everything for french breakfast imaginable and more i highly recommend the eggs provencale not something you can get anywhere else two eggs basted with a sliced hot house tomato thyme garlic and herbs de provance get the baguette toast and add the great hashbrowns for a mere dollar my personal favorite are all the crepes both sweet and savory especially recommend the spinach and swissonly the best mexican food in florida  since the first day i tried it i love it i keep coming backpossibly the best breakfast sandwich ever  on a biscuit  oh my gosh it was so goodordered a passion passport i love the name it contains passion fruit juice blend bananas pineapple mango juice blend papaya juice blend and raw cane sugar it was delicious and refreshingwe really liked this place everything we had was delicious portions were big chicken parm was so yummy cant wait to go back and try more stuff omg the mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh greek foodi love this restaurant the owners are the nicest family the food is delicious my favorite is bacon pizza i love that there is a play room for my kids to play while we wait for our foodi will get straight to the point if you are ever anywhere near camden nj in fact if you are anywhere in the state of nj get to santanas for breakfast and pastries   their coffee puts starbucks dd micky ds and all the rest to shame   their pastries are incredible  you would have to fly to boricua  puerto rico to even come close    my business is in neighboring pennsauken and we are there every morningone of the best burgers in philly  low key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room but dont let the modest face fool you this place rocks  menu is creative and fully customizable burgers are cooked on a flattop perfectly seared juicy slightly charred fries are hand cut fried fresh perfectly crispy and salty what more could you ask for from a burger place   pro tip  download the spot app for a rewards program and some good coupons aka free friesafter trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes i finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line i had heard of the food truck nazi and that it was the best in town and found gus the falafel nazi as he called himself lived up to his reputation and more  as my turn came up i approached the cart tenuously for i did not want to blow it by asking too many questions he immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside falafel was delicious as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it there was enough food for 2 people well worth the waitanother fivestar dining review  fresco servesup wonderful fresh and tasty pizza  we tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit tucson during the gem shows  for what you get their prices are very reasonable  my husband and i were new and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza how it is made from all fresh ingredients etc  the restaurant was very clean and inviting  we ordered the meatspecial pizza which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage pepperoni ham and bacon  the pizza was great  crispy and tender crust plenty of toppings and a multiplenapkiner  we also had a nice talk with the young owner and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers  we will definitely return next year  do i recommend frescoyou betcha i doi cant say enough great things about the baked goodies that come out of this kitchen  i have yet to have anything that is subpar  everything comes out with full flavor and with the right texture then the delicate and decorative detailingjust phenomenal  you can tell that time and love goes into each piece of goodness  i love all of the signature flavors  i am a classic cupcake person and absolutely love her signature cream cheese frosting  talk about melt in your mouth if you are looking for any sort of cake cupcake pie cookie or all the abovedo yourself a favor and treat yourself and loved ones to sugar coated no pun intended super delish no frills just great sea food sour dough bread was great and i loved the 80s music playingi really enjoy this little restaurant full of goodness primarily a dessert place seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics   i always enjoy the shaved ice when i come here the kind seasons offers is a different type of dessert that i havent seen anywhere else the variety of boba tea that they have is also very  good among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco if you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional 150 charge for a large size there are predesigned concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors the pre designed concoctions are a better deal  seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall across from a large shopping plaza with regal cinemas and marshalls with plenty of parking the store itself is clean bright and modern and is kidfriendly as there are high hairs available for use   the service has always been friendly fast and efficient seasons employs an order at the counter take number and food is borough out to you when ready model   i cant comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which boon touts as the best food item there the quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all   i look forward to many more visits with friends at this location check seasons out and enjoythis place was absolutely awesome 75 cent oysters after 2 dozen i moved to the excellent cheesy grits great place to eat even better during happy hourlove it i go to this place whenever i am in town and have never been disappointed the food is organic fresh and delicious i love that they buy from local farmers and fishermen they also grow a lot of their own veggies you cant get much fresher than that theres lots of variety so i havent even come close to trying everything my favorite breakfast item is carlys breakfast avocado on sourdough toast with a fried egg and sweet potatoes sooo good highly recommend this placei honestly didnt know this place existed until my friend suggested it for brunch over the weekend i cant believe i live four blocks away and havent been here before i ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant im one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was nothing left to take much to the surprise of my friends there is a small seating area downstairs and some window seating on the first floor id recommend getting there on the earlier side if youre with a group and want to sit id also recommend this for smaller groups will definitely be going backthis is the best location ever the donuts are made to order i believe after 5pm they are always super hot you can barely eat them  even the next day they are deliciousthis place is super cute i love how sustainable they are definitely recommend the people are awesome and pretty not to mention the food and coffee are extraordinarypleasantly surprised to find taiwanese restaurant in reno convenient to all of the hotels  solid boba tea and authentic taiwanese food if you know what to orderi loved this place  walking by i almost didnt go in because im a vegetarian and it looked like there was only meat on the menu im glad that i looked closer they have an excellent veggie burger a terrific selection of local microbrews and they even make their own ice cream i would definitely go back here again the next time i visit st louisi love this place super friendly staff great with kids and the food is amazing especially the hash browns you can also get tomatoes and grits on the side yum and on top of it all its not hard on the walletwow  that really sums up in a very good way my interactions with delicious designs and leigh anne  our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed  as the weeks went by the guest list increased so i decided i wanted a cake  with probably less than a weeks notice leigh anne stepped up and made the exact cake i had in my head  i asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations  not only did she make this happen beautifully she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute    im attaching a picture of the cake table  my daughter did the decorating and i must say for someone with not much in the decorating department everything came out better than i could ever imagine  and not only was the cake perfect it was yummy delicious  i cant wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer   if you are in need of any bakery needs in reno and you dont use leigh anne with delicious designs well then all i can say is im sorrythe best place to go for gyros the quality of their food is amazing i always get chicken gyros here but they have all kinds of goodies my daughter loves their burgers and the thick perfectly seasoned steak fries are the bomb always hot and fresh   the only thing i did not care for was the baklava they make it with pistaciosin reno for the night was a bit skeptical because wellits reno but this place far exceeded expectations very good taiwanese food compared to most places ive tried in different cities my recommendations  oyster omlet and scallion pancake   there are many other dishes i wish i could try will definitely miss this place once i leaveamazing pizza amazing after my first bite i felt like that oprah winfrey meme where her head is thrown back her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide and shes screaming you get a car except its not oprah its me and i dont get a car  i get a pizza but i felt that excited    this is basically the pizza i have been looking for since moving to the indianapolis area its a whole lot of nothing its not cut into square pieces its not crispy and thin its not redolent of oregano its thick and chewy cheesy greasy wonderful  it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste i have found my new pizza homeawesome sangria  rotating craft beers pizza and calzones keep me coming backthe cutest and definitely the friendliest coffee shop in boise the coffee is great but the staff is even better love this placeawesome food it was so fresh and delicious the papaya salad was delicious try the currysimply spicy and beautiful the service was great too they have take outthis place is so cute the interior is adorable and casual theres some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your fooddrinks its all so clean too which is a huge plus theres a little section with baked goods some asian and some more american they have mostly vietnamese food but i also saw some other types of food eg bulgogi i came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly we ordered banh mi and boba tea and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us the banh mi was really yummy especially the bread i had boba milk tea which was as good as any milk tea ive had before  they have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink definitely an incentive to return also their hours are awesome which is a huge plusthis is the best italian food ive ever had very small elegant restaurant entrees were really good and very tasty cheesecake to top it off the entire staff was super friendly highly recommended for date nighti brought my boyfriend here on a saturday for a tour and beer sampling since yuengling is one of his favorite beers we never knew it was so close  be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the faqs   first note there were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs the insisted closed toe shoe policy but that could be because of the next note  second note there is no productionbrewing on saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty  we looked around the main waitinglobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin  we had quite a large group which had to split into two smaller ones the tour lasted about 40 minutes starting with a ten minute video of the history of yuengling and the rise to present day next the guide takes you out to the brewery and into the kettle room around through the lab the bottle line and the holding tanks the tour was informative and hands on our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process she did a great job  once done you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and its drinks galore the best part free tips are encouraged  we tried the premium lager lager and black and tan sadly they were out of the lord chesterfield this day and the premium light is not available here in fl  overall a great tour and i will be revisitng with my parents when they are in townour 1st visit here we went through the drive thru  ordered 4 chicago dogs the total bill was 10  the chicago dogs were great  the only place in a 28 mile radius that you can purchase one the only 2 things missing were a poppyseed bun  celery salt my last attempt for a chicago dog locally was sonic yuck supergyro uses 100 beef hot dogs that neon green relish sport peppers onions dill pickle tomatoes  onion ill be back for more  also to try the other menu itemsi cant recall the day i went but it was a memorial resturant experience  i was greeted by an incredibly nice cashier after a hard decision i ordered a devils delight and the girl giggled  of course i was confused she explained it was devs delight and named after her because it was her idea for a burger and me calling it devils delight was a bit funny because her friends call her devil dev  hard to believe such a nice girl could aquire such a nickname but cute after she took my thorough of a medium burger and truffle fires i didnt have to wait very long even before i ate the burger the smell it self had my mouth watering  the burger was cooked to perfection and what was on the burger was amazing  this burger was a standard beef foundation with mozzarella cheese tomato basil and a portobello mushroom what great idea for a burger for a mushroom lover this with a side of the delicious truffle fries is perfect excellent quality and service  a bit expensive but worth every penny no question about it i will be a return customeri was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when i came across this place after figuring out what i wanted and put the be my bison burger in my cart for the online order i realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job defeated i started to search elsewhere but i could not get that burger off of my mind i came back a few hours later and submit my order i hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as i walked in  i grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work omg absolutely in love with this place it has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true thank youdave was very nice and explained the menu the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious hit the spot daves special pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeos too santa barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like thisyeah i know what youre thinking one wawa store is pretty much the same as another so why even bother writing a review but i think we have a winner here  when this wawa store opened for business gas prices at gas stations all along concord pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them sure this wawa store couldve followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents keeping the bulk of the profit but no theyll have none of that i love a store that is on the side of my wallet  secondly i love the automatic startstop digital air pump so far ive only seen that at bjs wholesale and sheetz its a snap to use and i get the exact tire pressure every time  as for service they seem nice and relatively efficient the internal layout of the store is the new style that i first saw in newark having separate noncigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods although ive never been there during the day so i wouldnt knowgreat service and awesome food we go here all the time each time it is excellent very very stellarwe sat at a pretty hectic lunch at johnny rockets in the casino our server was lyndel she was awesome helped us at every needy request lol good was good too im too fullthis place is fantastic the food is exceptional and the service couldnt be better very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere i eat here almost every weekend cant beat the cuban espressopizza was so good first time trying today and ordered online a little mess up with their system so they didnt get my order in time the guy called me back told me he was making the pizza in a rush and wasnt charging me for it 20 minutes later he came to the door himself with my fresh hot pizza and 2 brownies all for free  he was very apologetic customer service was fantastic and food was awesome this is my new go to delivery jointthis place just opened up near rivers edge apartments its a boutique style taqueria with a menu that anyone can enjoy the head chef was nominated for a james beard award and it shows in his flavorful and diverse menu choices the restaurant has both an outdoor and indoor setting with double doors that allow access to both with a bar around the corner   i personally have tried every taco on the menu as well as the appetizers each taco uses fresh local ingredients with an option for vegetarians and meat eaters like myself my two favorites are the mushroom taco and the short rib taco both have unique and fantastic flavors but i would recommend trying them all you will not be disappointed overall a great place for lunch or dinner i will definitely be going back soonaccording to my experience there is just one place in tokyo at the fish market where you get your seafood a little fresher here in santa barbara it does not get any fresher right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate dont expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here though the outside seating has a nice oceanharbor view it is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds the wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it put your name down and take a walk on the peer to freeup some extra room in your stomach  youll need itthis place is so lovely i went for a sweet and was amazed at the variety the gooey butter cookies were awesome and the german chocolate cupcake simply amazingobviously they are doing something right since they have been around since 1958 great soft serve and scooped ice cream cones boats floats and sundaes prices great too  enjoythis is hands down my favorite brewery in the world my husband is from stl and every time we go back to visit his family we visit the brewery most recently we didntbeer school with some of our friends and it was awesome i would definitely recommend it  if its your first time visit do the brewery tour first because seeing the clydesdales and the ends and outs of this brewery was amazing i cant wait to go back and do the brew master until next time budweisergreat cranberry orange muffin and caffe latte on a saturday morning great ambience and fast servicethis review is for their lunch menu as i have not tried their other offerings yet if you are lucky enough to have lunch there during their 112 sandwich times you are in for a real treat the two sandwiches i have tried the grinder and the southwesterner were absolutely delicious there wasnt a single taste bud that wasnt satisfied it is pricey and sandwiches are a little on the small side but it is well worth it   cant wait to try afford their steaks  food 55 service 55 price 45  a little high but great qualitywalked here from our condo and found this awesome place delicious slidersdonutsunique drinks awesome atmosphere and the staff was sooooooo friendly will definitely be backdue to its location in a strip mall near cool springs this version of the twelve south hipster gourmet burger up is certainly not as trendy but it makes up for it by delivering the goods awesomely tasty and messy burgers with fresh meat and fixings the regular fries are delicious until you try the truffle fries they are truly outstanding not greasy and finished with paresan cheese the metaphorical cherryontop was the chocolate milkshake which actually had no cherry on top the shake was nothing fancy but perfectly made creamy not too sweet or overchocolatey  if you want your upscale burger experience but still want your burgerfriesshake holy trinity come herequick read aside from the parking and occasional crowds  this place is fantastic  thankfully buddy brew is expanding  a move that i hope will relieve some of the terrible parking issues this place is a musttry in tampa the baristas are friendly knowledgable and efficient the breakfast and lunch options are solidly tasty the coffee is roasted with a level of care that im glad to see in tampa one of my absolute favorite places on the planetgot a gift certificate to this place over 6 months ago and just last month finally had the great  pleasure of going perfect  spot for lunch im in love with the mixed salad salad sandwich one sandwich that i will actually crave yummy homemade ice cream that you wont be able to get enough of  we will be backamazing i just got back from the bakery i ordered tres leche hubby got chocolate dipped cannoli with original filling we also got italian wedding cookies and dark chocolate florentine cookies the tres leche taste just like my grandma used to make it minus the malibu liquor the cannoli was delicious the italian wedding cookies was a little crunchy yet still delicate it also had the perfect amount of anise flavor the dark chocolate florentine is so yummy that says a lot because i dont like coconut the chocolate to coconut ratio is perfect we will definitely be going backdelicious best place around for ice cream  everything is made fresh from cows without hormones and antibiotics  its cash only but its worth the trip to the atmexcellent healthy options for nola dining with lots of to go choices i had turkey meatballs and spaghetti it is a wonderful lunch placethis is everything i want in take out food  fresh yummy and relatively healthy i also love that there is a good to go place in northern liberties that is convenient  there is not enough of thatoh man this is the spot right here everything is made to order and sooo worth the wait im from chicago and have been a self proclaimed sandwich expert for most of my lifethis place deserves every bit of those 5 stars well done guysoutrageous birthday cake we chose the devils food cake  with vanilla buttercream icing it was delicious beyond words 12 adults who typically shy away from high calorie sweets  ate every last bite the staff were super friendly  accommodating we probably could have ordered a bit more advanced  cant say enough positives about our experience so glad to know i also have a location closer to me in old city wish i could have another piece of that cakelet me start by saying that the food here is by far the best mexican i have had in st pete  its nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to weekend nights do get a little hectic so i would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order for the meat lovers out there you cant go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazingwings wings and more wings  chatham tap is my favorite place to get wings in the indianapolis area  they are meaty the sauce is great and i usually always have to take some home for the next day  i went with a fairly large group and got to sample different things on the menu  i highly recommend the onion rings  they have a large selection of beer as well  since i heard they were a soccer bar i did not know what to expect when i first arrived  however the atmosphere is great  it is full of fans of all different sports and the staff is willing to show whatever sport you want to watch on tv  the service was excellent  no one in my group had to ask for one thing while we were there  i highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for a great meal great service and a great time with friendsbest desserts ever dark and sinister is amazing really anything with that uses the chocolate ice cream is my favoriteif you want to eat at prep  pastry on the weekends go right when it opens or before it closes there is always a long wait because of how busy it gets  but the wait is always worth it the food there is absolutely amazing i go there often and love the green eggs  ham bloody marys and mimosas they gave me a free pastry on my birthday once it was delicious i wish i remembered what it was called   i also love that they serve exo coffee here a local coffee  nothing better than a great breakfast with great coffee to go with itthe new baconbleu cheeseburger is excellent probably one of the best fast food burgers ive had in a while dave thomas would be proudive been a few times and i havent been disappointed yet its for meat eaters vegetarians and vegans its nice to have a healthy place to go tothe best frozen yogurt i have found in the central bucks area at the time of the initial review  everyone is super friendly and the flavors are good  but i have since found another location that is a rival  0stopped for a very healthy burger while visiting philly after performing a nearby prince tribute show discovered one of the greatest burger places on planet earth thank you alya  company at bareburger     andrew von gregor  pro session  touring guitarist  los angelesis there a 12step program to help manage a reanimator coffee problem if so please sharethey just opened today and wow arent we lucky to now have 2 meaderies within a mile or two of each other  mead is a type of fermented honey beverage the abv alcohol percent is generally 1014 so more along the lines of wine than beer there   we tried goober vitis peanut butter and jelly suzys cherry pie and the coffee one all were perfect flavors are pure beautiful nose all around great   the space is very nice nice big tables that seat 68 easily an lshaped bar a standup bar around the tanks then there are picnic tables outsidedelicious top shelf pastries i am outraged at the poor ratings if youre looking for cheapness over flavor then go to panera service has always been exceedingly pleasent when i go and i am an obnoxious needy customer we are so excited to have them make macaroons for our weddingthis is a great place to bring the kids to they can have juice a slice of cake and homemade popsicles they think it is a tea party i have tried everything once and my favorites are the homemade doughnuts filled with read bean the popsicles the patbingsu and even the good ol coffee cream and sugarthis chipotle location was great i wanted to thank chipotle for recognizing teachers for teacher appreciation week  the line was very small and they served quickly as a pose to another location that had the line wrapped around the store  their food is always fresh tasteful and fulfilling  my go to is always the bowl with white cilantro lime riceblack beans steak and all the toppings  must eat with a bag of fresh tortilla chipsi recently vacationed in st petersburg with my family dooners was definitely my favorite meal of the trip great food and incredibly helpful and friendly staff would definitely recommend to anyone and wouldnt hesitate to go againi can say this is the best burger of my life  you sit outside and goleta holester ave is nothing special   but the burger is the bestthis place is absolutely amazing a cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive i walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if i should make a purchase the employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings  definitely try some and you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste you cant really make a proper judgment because there isnt enough to judge from not the case here  i got the salted caramel banana the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake  thoughts omg i never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert but man after this i wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding although i highly doubt that i could make it half as good their desserts are crafted perfect  threefour layers depending on what you get the bottom layer the the pudding second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cakewhatever it was  it was amazing third layer the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping the creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth everything just comes together so nicely   the upside pineapple cake was bomb the cake wasnt too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to taste like what its suppose to the pineapple flavor isnt overwhelming but just right my only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too caramelized with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew  definitely go to this place i was so sad that there was no option to leave them a tip they use an ipad to ring you up the servicehelp was so great and i would have left a tip but i had no cash any ways highly recommend this place for dessertsi visited the new paoli location big selection of tasty donuts its about timethe cardboard impostors found at dunkin are so lame compared to these beauties salted caramel bacon maple lemonnow youre talking my language breakfast sandwiches muffins and bagels oh myso much care is given to healthy delicious food ex japanese squash rather than white potatoes in curry thay have nice touches like a welcome snack and straw wrappers twisted in a rose the sauces are amazing menu has so many options they accomodate special dietary needs easily since everything is made from scratch even the desserts have that extra touch using both white and black sticky rice this is our goto for thai from now ongreat grocery store in the midcity neighborhood it had great deli soup hot bar and salad bar options it was like a waaaay less expensive whole foods on the weekends they had crawfish or lobster boils by the lbs this would be my go to store if i lived here for sure big plus its local   fried chicken was bombliciouswe tried these at the collingswood art festival this weekend they are a bit pricey but worth it the flavor is perfect they arent greasy i will be seeking them out once you try them you will want to have them again they are a light cheddar curd battered and friend you dont taste grease or batter the flavor of the cheese is delicious and so stringy and melty the sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd well worth the splurgebeers were amazing i got the porter the double ipa and the table gutt and they were all fantastic food was also killer if you like russian cuisine they had a special when i went with a sausage and sauerkraut which was tasty i also got the pickled everything appetizer great choice this place rulesyou need a cinnamon roll from the bake house  you probably need two life would have just a little less happiness and light without their cinnamon rolls the coffee and salads are also excellent a lovely saturday morning breakfast treatsimply the best everything from here is good i come from a very italian family and whenever there is a family event there is always termini brothers dessert trays their cannolis are amazing highly recommendfavorite place in nashville for breakfast this is a must go to spot near vandy and always busypark in the back lot and be sure to get the parking ticket from the machine so you wont be chargedits free parking for a specified amount of time my favorite is banana pancakesthink banana bread only in a pancake perfection i dont leave nashville until i go here to eat my pancakeswe went here hoping for a good breakfast  and we werent disappointed  we went on valentines day not because we wanted to but because we had to  in doing so  we knew the wait would be long which it was an hour and a half though i hear theres always a wait   the place is buzzing with servers and busboys the tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another  so seating is tight  the service was though considering how busy it was  i ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg  my girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon  everything was amazing  the pancakes were hearty but fluffy the side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing  but it was cooked to her liking  the cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything bacon  peppers salsa sour cream  syrup yes  all of that  if youre looking for good coffee  this is not the place which was surprising   the only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple or bothfinally warming up for yogurt they have crepes here too its awesome come try themi moved to philadelphia from the midwest as a wide eyed 19 year old full of wonder yuengling lager was the first beer ive ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time smooth sweet cheap its like me in a bottle i love that the bottlecaps can be rusty i like that the taste varies per batch i even like its relatively low alcohol content   the tour was pretty great the british tour woman was funny in a non canned way she took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat signed sports i havent a clue i was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment i couldve spit in the mash and no one wouldve been the wiser the whole facility reminded me of st pete catholic high 50s cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls   the tasting thats what you came for right fantastic they were out of lord chesterfield but who drinks that i tasted the shit out of the lager probably 6 times it makes sense the bar is next to the gift shop and i went a bit insane in there   the fact that dick yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star this is a family business one that deserves support as inbev has encroached upon everything elsefirst i love that they offer food delivery second that is a gyro i got one delivered with fries and actually i didnt need the fries the gyro was so big i had to save half  both the fries and the gyro were very tasty the tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender ill be backlove this place introduced almost 25 years ago when i enrolled at the ud and have loved ever since for longest time it was basically just a delaware treat but so happy it is so many more places now just want to know when you are coming to the huntsville al area sorry this review is not about this specific location but if it is half as good as others i have been to it will be great this location has plenty of seating was real clean and playing good tunes as i waited about only negative is it doesnt have herrs chips like the delaware locations but that is not really a problemi went to spasso the other night with some friends all four of us were so pleased with our experience and our meals we each had something different i had the special for the evening which was seafood jumbo shrimp and jumbo lump crab over pappardelle with tomato and asparagus it was to die for and my leftovers the next day were just as tasty  service was amazing and wine was perfect i live on state street and cant wait to visit again very soonlove this place the turkey beans and biscuits are amazing have had better pecan pie but that wont stop me from coming back freddys has the best fastfood style burgers ive ever had great toppings choices and fresh meat their fries are delicious with their fry sauce their custard is just as good as their food its rich and creamy and did i mention how delicious it isthis place had fantastic donuts they were very well priced and so soft we tried the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter we will definitely be going backsuper cute place employees are very nice cookie dough is delicious this is a must  we are glad we found it lost while in townhave eaten at this place 3 times every time was a good experience for me and the kids no smoke no noise and good food good service

true gem and the food was delicious had so much that i am eating it for lunch again today  and i cant wait please recommend to everyone you know in manayunk dont want to lose this placecalories and diabetes be damned  fewer things could be better than gelati on days as brutally hot as the ones weve had this week  thanks for helping to cool us all down w your frozen treats  five stars for you  ps  visit the website for a little vanilla icewe recently moved from brooklyn ny and have been in search of some really good pizzaand here it is we were so happy to bite into a thin crispy crust it was awesome the service was amazing and we couldnt be more pleased i highly recommend this place if you love great pizza and excellent customer service they will surely get our business again and againthis place was nice clean and bright its your typical serveyourself fro yo bar with several choices for frozen yogurt and a topping station the cashier was very berry nice and let me pay via credit card even though i was a few cents short of the minimum id say my son enjoyed his time herethis is my favorite place to enjoy gelato in st louis   consider the   coffee houselike atmosphere  large outdoor patio with a fountain and surrounding foliage  delicious gelato and baked goods   yes everything at gelateria is pleasingtry the spinach and feta hummus it is amazing i had the chicken caesar pita and if was wonderful the caesar dressing was very flavorful and the greens romaine mixed greens etc were good quality and flavorful not your typical bagged junk pulling up the the place i was skeptical theyre in an old garage but give it a try well worth iti am a groupie he is amazing i am sad that i got to have his dish only once now all construction on market i cant find him  his chicken is the most tender and smoky ive ever had side dishes are creative and awesome too  i hope he is back sooncorropolese is a staples in these parts if youre looking to get tomato pie its sacrilege to go anywhere else for it now i will admit they do offer a variety of other items but i couldnt tell you what they are whenever an event calls for a tomato pie this is where my family goes no one does it bettergood and fast servicemeat is always very juice bbq sauce is greatprices are reasonableif you this truck around stop and try you wont be disappointedspot on  i got the veg and the spicy fries  the veg is a portabella burger with grilled mozzarella picked veg arugula and gauc  wholly noncow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger  the bella is on bottom then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that  i actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasnt super melted a good thing the gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula  theres a nice bun to contents ratio and for bonus points its a potato bun  wasnt sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in  are they hot sauce fries etc  turns out they are of the crabfries variety with some subtle other spices added in  nice portion  not too big  the atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar  i think thats the best way to describe it  its pretty small so i wouldnt choose to ever eat in most likelybest mexican restaurant ive been to in a long time food was great drinks were great and prices are reasonableive been a fan of this place for a long time their hazelnut cake is awesome as are many of their other cakes i was sent there years ago by recommendation for this signature cake and it more than lived up to its reputation  their butter cookies are awesome   absolutely love them i frequently stop in to get cookie gifts to give to family and friends for special occasions  always a huge hit  i think their prices are right in line with their products they are always consistently great  the people that work there are wonderful  friendly and helpfulo wings has the best wings hot momma and the original for the win oh and the bulgogi wrap my dad whos very picky even praised the wings and wrap   their service and attitude is very very friendly and accommodating   i phoned in a to go order originally for 6 people later half an hour before the pick up time i added 10 more entrees they were very very accommodating and had me ready to go and out the door in 15 minutes   yumm cant wait to go back for moretwo coworkers and i came here after flying in from chicago for an afternoon snack it was almost 3 so we asked if we could wait until happy hour to order the place was completely empty while we were there but the space was well decorated and very open   we all ordered cocktails i got the mint julep which was not great but then a gin drink that was fantastic and they were all pretty and tasty we also ordered mac and cheese fries brussels sprouts and a pretzel i didnt try the sprouts i really dont like them but everything else was so good and the prices during happy hour were a great deal   ill definitely be back next time we go to renoloved this place especially the salmon only eaten here at lunch and not a problem going to add this one to my lunch rotation spotless restrooms and the service is top notchgreat vegetarian and organic menu friendly and helpful staff and delicious coffee im definitely coming backi love this place best veggie burger in town handmade patty and the pretzel buns yumprobably the best coffee shop ive ever been to everything they make is great their pure black and draft latte are the best iced coffee drinks ive ever had full stop their drip and espresso are also very tasty and strong if you are in the area and love coffee you need to stop by this spot   only complaint the line can get absurdly long however the staff here is some of the best around and the line moves very quickly on that note service here is also very friendlyxtreme tacos has become one of my favorite places everything i have ever ordered has been delicious we have probably gotten food between 810 times i have e joyed everything for sure always have to get chips their homemade chips are to die for the salsa and quest are both excellent for dipping  besides the delicious food the people who work there are xtremely friendly and helpful the guy who is usually at the counter is so warm and welcomingi love bings boba the taro snow is my go to drink definitely the best boba spot in tucson the place is always clean they have board games for you to play the staff is helpful and friendly my husband ordered a drink that unfortunately was not at the right flavor level he told the staff and they made him a new drink that was to his likinghave you ever tried a new lunch place and liked it so much that you went back for dinner that night and lunch the next day i have done the back to back to back only once at greko   ive love the rotisserie chicken pita with fries if you are in the mood for something healthier they have great salads definitely try the horta greens you can substitute fries for horta greens or have them on the side the perfectly cooked and seasoned greens are delicious  i also love the athenian chicken half a rotisserie chicken   as a quick casual foodfirst restaurant greko has hit the sweet spoti have groen up eating italian food and i have not come across a more legit place than mazzaros love their sauce and meatballsafter always shopping at the randalls off jefferson it was nice to see west county get their own randalls staff here is uber friendly and helpful beer selection is solid here with plenty of styles to choose fromprices are competitive with the other beer markets around well worth your time and moneygreat tour very informative  our tour guide raymond was awesome and the food stops along the way were very delicious definitely worth the time and moneythis place is amazing  they make the donuts fresh with each order  in fact i had to wait 10 minutes for them to cool down before i could eat them  this location is clean and never super busy  its a really great addition to the neighborhood and people with cars are sure to appreciate the parking lot  best donuts in philly and the delaware valleyhavent eaten at wendys in a long time but these have really changed for the better fries with sea salt  really good quality for fast food normally i dont even rate fast foodi love this food truck they have the tastiest street foods like their captain crunch tilapia burrito who wouldve thought of that the fried fish is so flakey and delicious paired with fresh cabbage tomatoes avocado and sriracha mayo i have also tried their katsu and curry chicken which are so rich in flavor their thai tea is also on point so much to offer from a small food truck i live in jersey and i have driven here many times just to get food they are so friendly and provide great food at a great pricethe loose tea can get expensive  but i love getting ready made teas pretty wide selection always something new and they let you mix to make your own concoction always comes out perfect the staff are the nicest people around they remember me when i come in and remember what i like my personal favorite wine and liquor store in nashville  the staff is usually very friendly and helpful without being pretentious  you can ask for a 10 dollar bottle of wine recommendation without being scoffed at  the selection is good and the prices are comparable with other liquor stores in town    one negative the curb is a little bit high pulling in  dont gun it unless you want to scrape some rust off of the bottom of your cari had just moved to nashville and one of my friends told me i had to come here were not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point anyways i went around 915 and the line wasnt too bad  id say a 510 minute wait the food was awesome i had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for the sausage side i had didnt rock my world then again its not the side dish pantry you dont pay at the table  they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast    rip  i drive by it almost every morning  if you want to avoid the line go either right when they open to around 715food is excellent people are welcoming choices are long list sandwiches have great meat in them hand made toasted ravioli is some of the best in townnothing more to say than this is the best donut place ever i literally wished they shipped their products when i moved to florida i missed it so much its only in new orleans sad facecouldnt say it better than the below poster excellent food service and prices  located where mugshots used to be rip one of my coworkers had been raving about this place in particular the falafel and of course the very kind owner  went with my prewife and we shared beef gyro carved pita falafel pita and hummus plate everything was extremely fresh i concur on the crisp lettuce well seasoned and just plain delicious  a lot of food as well and complimentary baklava we took our leftovers home i wrapped the two remaining bites of my gyro  its that good  i highly recommend this place and youll definitely walk out with a smile i think this spot is still relatively unknown and i very rarely post reviews this is a unique spot to manayunk and i will be referring all of my friends as i really want the restaurant to succeed  because the owner deserves it and of course for my selfish appetitenot only was the food excellent but the people here are beyond niceand genuine i had eggs benedict the poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on was excellent we were given a cream pancakes to taste test by our awesome server tina i can honestly say it was the best pancake ive ever tasted so full of flavourvanilla and soft aa pillow  they melted in my mouth i didnt even use syrup stellargreat service my husband ordered a cheese and bacon burger and i got the crawfish sausage por bo both well made and great tastingwhile at drexel university i decided to try a new food truck and go for something that wasnt the typical food truck  my girlfriend and i always noticed this place was crowded around lunch but never knew why  after being recommended to try it by a friend we decided to go ahead and order lunch here  cucina zapata is at the end of the food truck row at the center of drexel universitys campus  the truck has a graffiti style design which can be easily distinguished from the other food trucks here  i decided to order 2 thai short rib tacos while my girlfriend got the capn crunch tilapia burrito  the food has a good visual appearance which made us more eager to eat it once we got inside the building  i really enjoyed the thai short rib tacos even though they put hot sauce on it  they were definitely better than the typical taco bell food and left me with a 5 star review feeling inside  my girlfriend also really enjoyed her burrito  overall this food truck provides very good food at a good price  i recommend this place to anyone looking for a good lunchif you have not had their cream filled donuts then you simply have not lived my friend incredible i came to philly to visit my sister and she brought us here on our second to last day the cream filled doughnut was so incredible that i drove all the way back here on our way home to get a half dozen of them for the drive back to michigan and if youre wonderingyes yes i crushed all 6 of those delicious pieces of heaven and i wont apologize for itthis is only a review on their oysters because thats all i ever eat from here they have the freshest best tasting oysters ever i asked our server what type of oysters they were and she didnt know but said she would ask someone she never came back with the answer but that was ok oysters delicious i promise you you will not be disappointedthis is a small coffe place own by karyn a blond sweet lady with a big smile great coffee and they have drive throughim still new to tucson but having tried a large sample of the various pizza places near the u of a i have to say that this is the best so far   in fact id say its the best ive ever had better than the places i tried in nyc even the crust is just magical the five alarm which i tried is the perfect amount of spicy for those of us who crave that extra spicyness in our food   if you decide to try it i doubt youll be disappointedthis place is my absolute fave the flavors are spot on they taste exactly the way you imagine but better the strawberries  champagne toasted marshmallow and cheesecake  are a few of my personal favorites i moved to phoenix a few years back and was ecstatic when i found out they opened locations in the valley this is a tucson gem that i will continue to visit over and overtry the salted caramel chocolate cake it was the best we ever had i also tried the apple brown betty   awesome good beer selectionhigh scoreunfortunately i wasnt playing a video game with my friends but rather wracked up the highest weight for my frozen yogurt why did is win this completely made up competition because this place is that good seriously everything tastes great and even the fatfree options still feel like im splurging on my constant beingagirl diet the location is great if youre out an about on south street and need something sweet the habit burger is a straight up legit burger place  its always been a toss up for me between in n out and habit burger  i got me a double char and choco shake at the goleta habit and it was as usual delicious  the onion rings are very good alsothey dont just have great cookies cupcakes and puddings i ordered a salted caramel cake for a birthday party and it was amazing  four layers of moist cake with caramel buttercream between each layer i checked before i ordered to make sure that the icing would be from real ingredients indeed  its made from butter and sugar and it tastes like it the cake was both elegant and delicious a rare combinationso happy i found a bomb local sushi place always ignored this shop going to dominos but im so glad i popped in will be coming here more than i should from now on i got this sushiya roll and i was more than pleased the salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point 1010 recommend this spotsimply the best frozen custard you will ever have in the city do not come to st louis mo and not try this gemmy husband damon and i like to support local stores and establishments when we travel supporting the local economy any way we can helps us feel we are keeping real businesses alive and being business owners ourselves we want all to prosper so when you go into this shop you will be pleased to find that all the goods offered are locally made designed and or manufactured by locals its eclectic and you can find clothes artwork food items and other stuff the shop owner is friendly and smiles easily we ended up with a dragonfly wall sculpture made from a chair leg and pens that are space age and unique and were designed by a local gentleman check it out im so impressed with this coffee shop coming from sacramento my husband and i know good coffee this place is such a gem i wish there was something like this back in sac anyways this is my goto reno coffee shop for sure their matcha lattes are so good sighi just recently moved to idaho and today i went to chipotle and she comped me one meal out of 3 and it made my week let alone my day lol she was so nice to start with and had the best customer service she definitely stood out in the staff her name was taylor shes absolutely awesomethey have some ridiculous number of martinis featuredi think its 500 give or take a 100 they also have petron margaritas which you can purchase in pitcher form let me repeat giant pitchers of petron pomegranate margarita goodness why are you still sitting there   prices are reasonable but not cheap that shouldnt stop you also the people that work there offer fabulous service and are willing to hold your hand while you wade through the menu if they have the timethese girls are busyif you are shopping for any kind of italian food product you need not bother going anywhere but claudios  first you must understand the cultureclaudios is old school  they are family  there is a reason everyone lines up and tolerates standing in line  the product is that good  these folks know their cheeses  they know their food  if you have a question they will bend over to help you  other customers will too  im medigan as they say americanie  i am not italian  hanging in claudios makes me want to be  going to claudios isnt like running to the acme for a box of pastathis is an experience  everyone should have an experiencethis review is based on the location in atlantic city  got the strawberry flavor and omg i was not expecting it to be that good it is not as sweet as others but its perfect it had little bits of strawberry in it the price is really good also 2 for a small i believe my only regret is not trying all the other flavors next time im in phillyac i will def be getting thisi went there for lunch yesterday it was really good the staff was very friendly and the portions are almost enough for two people to eat the recipes are from mrs doll and one of her sons is carrying on the legacythis little unassuming shop is tucked away in a strip mall full of furniture stores had it not been for yelp i would never have known it was here now i wont be taking a trip to brentwood without stopping for a scoop  the flavors are quite varied and innovative i had pumpkin and some sort of whipped cream cheese flavorboth were divinewhich when mixed tasted just like pumpkin pie the owner michael is absolutely a sweetheart and is generous with the samples and the recommendations and hes always coming up with new flavors to whip up i cant wait to see what he concocts nextgreat food and good coffee wish they had more of an espresso bar with coffee options but food and baked goods are spectacularholly grove is the best im consistently impressed with their selection of produce you can basically get everything plus more stuff they dont have at the normal grocery store except its all local we are so lucky to live in a place with a year round growing season and we should really take advantage of that i will get off my high horse now lol   they also have locally raised meats bread from local bakeriesits just a great place to support local growers and makers also there are always people wandering outside tending to the garden its a nice atmosphere the only thing i dislike is the location  because im allll the way across town thats not their fault thoughmy last full day in new orleans and i had to come here came in the pouring rain too i really wanted some authentic new orleans style food yes its still authentic if its vegan i dont care what you say lol jamone was nice enough to give me a little taste of everything so i could pick that just made it harder because i wanted it all im telling you  there is no bad choice here everything was so good and flavorful and the bread pudding was the topper for me i would be a regular if i lived out here do yourself a favor and come try this place come hungry too so you can have it all like me  ohand the other great thing  this is one vegan place where they give you a ton of food without emptying your wallet amazing food and servicei live in the neighborhood so i try to frequent mint as much as i can no choice is a bad choice also the taro tapioca smoothie is the perfect cure for a sweet tooththe longest bar in the city  for as crazy busy as the happy hours are the friday and saturday late night crowds are really relaxed and theres always a place to sit  this is the perfect place on a saturday night after a show at the troc if you dont want to go to chinatown or a dive bar   ive been walking over after shows at the electric factory lately and its the place to unwind after standing up for 3 hours    ibp has all kinds of sports packages so its a great place to go to watch that out of town football or baseball game  the upstairs bar has pool tables and a separate jukebox  edit  rip ibpgreat choice in a small shop worth the drive the wine cakes are excellent just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going backbanana pudding is amazing you can get the extra toppings but just plain no nana is great they care about their customers and are always welcoming i love supporting their shop and hope its around for yearslove it here  the atmosphere is great the options are more than average and the lunch bento boxes are great  if you have the opportunity always try the boba as well  those complaining are just picky and should go back to eating at home    try their beef braised soup as it is hearty and deliciousholy  good rolls great service good prices lots of healthy options try the sushi it worth every pennyalways dead on with fresh made foods folks are friendly food is great italian specialties are always tasty great rolls too the comment from ottis b is not true maybe it was him as he said after paying he went back owners aim to pleasethe ox tail pho was legit the portions were perfect and the small family business feel to it made the experience better the price was right i know their dipping fish sauce was homemade as it was super delicious we have a place to come eat every time we get into renohad the chicken and french toast and it was over the top while it would do some good to have more shade on the patio it was still an enjoyable experience they are pet friendly too we will be backthis was a great place to have brunch with the family it is very clean and the staff were great i love the decor plus my four year old actually ate here that is a huge deal he doesnt like anythinggreat food and service the antipasto was by far the best that i have ever had  the pasta is all fresh and full of flavor the fishermans stew was loaded with great tender fish in a saffron sauceanimo juice is the best find in haddonfield after the hadrosaurus of course  i stop at animo every time i go to jersey to visit my family or do i visit my family every time i stop at animo  debatable  animo started with juice  not frozen juices with sorbet  yogurt added  real juice    their menu has expanded  they now call themselves animo juice  burrito bar  the burrito menu features 10 burritos all under 10 f my favorite the haight  ashbury is stuffed with rice beans meatroasted veggies cheese lettuce tomato guacamole  sour cream  not that hungry have a petito a small version of the burrito averaging 5  porky  petunia  the name is as cute as the petito is yummy  shredded lettuce pulled pork  pineapple salsa    a breakfast petito  animo md juice destroy any hangover  the md is juiced greens carrot orange apple kiwi banana  spirolina   my bf loves the chilly palmer  acai apple banana yogurt  flax seed    for a happy belly add or substitute the perfectly cooked quinoa to any dish  the border salad is a perfect example lettuce guac pico de gallo cheese tortilla chips cilantro lime vin  sub quinoa for meat     fiberfull signature juices frozen whipped bananas sliced fresh wheat grass cheaper than jameson  yogurtgranola bowls    the citys juice bars have something to learn from animohad a very memorable birthday in sb and was so happy to have wine edventures be my gift sean picked us up saturday morning and was super friendly funny too it was just my husband and i along with a group of 10  who happened to be all guys having a bachelor party haha so that was pretty funny we stopped at 3 wineries and 1 brewery sean explained where we were as we were driving around and also gave us lessons at the tastings he provided us with bottled water and souvenir wine glasses we had lunch at the 2nd vineyard of the day which was very good  choice of sandwich and a pasta salad side with chips and a cookie the cookies are awesome it was a fun day and id highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking for a fun day in the sb areacool ass brewerybar very unique decor that suits the name of the place we came on dat afternoon and it was packed but we got 3 seats easy beer selection was good especially for imperial stout lovers no food there but you can bring your on or there are plenty of places across the streetabsolutely amazing and unique food love their bobba and pork pancakethis place is absolutely fantastic i honesty really dont even like sweets and am not all that into donuts but this place will make you a believer the apple fritter is amazingly delicious and you cant go wrong with a chocolate long john dont even bother with any other donut shops in stlmy wife and i visited this hidden gem today and were not let down the shop was clean bright colorful and comfortable we were able to sample all the flavors listen to the story of how they came about and walked off with many bags of deliciousness the owners there were so kind they took the time to understand exactly what kind of foods we enjoy to match us up with the perfect popcorn definitely coming back sooni went here after a recommendation that this is the best coffee place in philly and im so glad i checked it out the cafe area itself is super nice  clean they also offer tap and sparking water to customers which is awesome prices are very reasonable and the staff is super friendly my friend and i chatted with one of the baristas for a few minutes and he gave us some protips on how to make a killer espresso i will definitely be coming back here again soonprovi is such a wonderful person i came here because of her the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and chicken noodle soup is just to die forgreat mexican byob i went to las cazuelas for the first time for my birthday  we had a wonderful time  i was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends  this was the perfect choice we brought our own bottle of tequila and they made tasty margaritas for the table  those were a big hit with my friends and a cool twist for a mexican byob  the restaurant is cute  plus the food here is delicious   im surprised this place doesnt have higher reviews on yelp because it far exceeded my expectations   the guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy  i ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables and asked for it spicy  my entre had an attractive presentation on the plate ie looked classy and was delicious well seasoned and very fresh on my suggestion my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes ie a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds and it was tasty too   i should also note that the waitress was very attentive  when i placed my order i explained to her that i have mild lactose intolerance and cant eat much butter or cream but am okay with cheese so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil rather than butter  thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request    the prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual mexican food and i love the fact theyre a byob  the chef serves creative and inspired cuisine which has a traditional flair and style to it  in other words dont come here for regular tacos or burritos  come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price and bring tequila for the perk of byob margaritasawesome experience just ate here for the first time and wow it was good our meals came very quickly and tasted great our waiter lyndel was very amazing and made our experience memorable the restaurant felt a tad bit cramped but other than that everything was awesomei started coming to moreno when i moved back to brandon and had an itch for alessi bakery but didnt  want to drive too far someone told us about moreno so we gave them a shot a great small familyowned love it bakery right in the heart of brandon they make a huge variety of baked goods from fresh bread to huge cupcakes to flan and cookies they also have the best freshly made cuban sandwich with their own special sauce spread my favorite thing to get here are the almond sticks i am a huge fan of anything almond but these are so fresh with loads of almonds and almond flavoring if you have a sweet tooth this is definitely the place to goif you like lobster this is the place great prices great service and great food very casual dining  back again to enjoy the lobster special w 1  14 lb lobster1  mussels and 12 steamers with corn and potatoes for 1999 see photo  clam chowder so good as is the ucon lobster roll covered in melted butterthis is some good motherfuckin ice cream  positive tell me youre serving bananas foster today freshly made waffle cones establishment doesnt look like a fucking kindergarden  i can eat ice cream and still feel like an adult owner is a harvard grad but isnt a stuck up asshole  actually seems pretty down to earth and can hold a conversation with the layman  negative im reaching but i kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater  would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out  the only time i really think about this place is after rolling out of publix and by then ive already got bags of frozen food thawing out and dont have time for ice cream  not even some bad ass ice cream  hey even 5 star joints could use some constructive criticismjust wanted to drop a quick review and say if you havent gotten ice cream from here yet you are missing out its all homemade he has different flavor selections based on the seasons and he lets you try lots of different flavors till you get just the right one love the customer service and quality of the ice creambeing from cincinnati we know ipas and urban south has the best ones weve found in nola brewery is casual and low keya fantastic spot with amazing snoballs so many great flavors including many that are all natural as an added bonus the service is super friendly  cant wait to go back soontop notch food i ordered the 3 course meal and everything was beyond super deliciousness our waiter jenna was amazing knowledgeable and fun she made our experience sheer perfection i cant thank the staff enough for making my birthday dinner heaven on my taste budsone of the best donuts ive ever had the dough is perfect  the icing is not so sweet it cuts your teethweve been meaning to stop in and tonight we finally did and glad we were  there isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said so i will just reiterate some of the reasons why taste of havana will become a regular spot for us   i had the pan con bistec and my wife had the cuban we loved the bread and everything between it usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal but i just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night so alas i dont have another meal guess ill just have to go back   and the company was just as inviting we chatted with diana dayana for quite a while after we ate and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant and how it really is a labor of love   try it out order a sandwich have a seat chat them up and enjoy im already looking forward to our next visit and thinking about who else i want to bring with us  thank you for a wonderful eveningneat place in the funk zone of santa barbara good selection of beers friendly staff  like having the taster option which they do offer  it was another beautiful way to spend a sunday  hope to return sooni decided to try this spot after the reviews of the fried chicken it definitely didnt disappoint crispy not greasy and very juicy the biscuit was light and flakey and the rice was absolutely delicious for sure this is going to be a regular stop when in nola  ps  in the excitement i forgot to grab my wallet when leaving my hotel room and didnt realize it until i was placing my order rather than send me on my way the manager on duty told me to just bring the money tomorrow i truly appreciate the gesture and find it refreshing that small business owners place this level of trust in their clientele thank you juliefriday night staff was friendly  they have all your basics  plus hotdogs funnel cake and churros  price was rightwent the other night in a group of 13  we had a great time  chef poon is so much fun  you can tell he truly has a passion of the culinary arts  the best part you feel like your actually eating in the chefs kitchen  my only suggestion is bring a big appetite because there is so much foodcompanion is one of the best lunch spots in clayton  the menu is salads sandwiches and soups  if you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal  i actually worked at companion back in 2001 what a change it has gone through but the food is still just as yummy    my salad rotation goes between the picnic basket and the go green but all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them  you cant go wrong with any of the salads  the sandwiches are all also great  my husband loves the frenchie i love the mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the fa la la yum the breads are all made in house  i will always love companion and go for lunch a lot  its basically every week at this pointthis is a gigantic restaurant with ample seating and a nice ambience   beverages this is the perfect place for cocktails coffee and  cider there is a wide variety of drink selections and the cinnamon and caramel apple cider drinks are wonderful additions to the fall menu   starters the new orleans bbq shrimp is quite tasty but by far my favorite thing to do is order the pomme frites with garlic mayo these little guys are like crack and even people who hate mayo seem to love the dipping sauce   entrees the curried chicken salad is fantastic though i wish they would consider serving it on different bread it comes on two mini sandwich rolls the blt is also a good choice the addition of avocado and chipotle sauce is pretty ingenious and the club sandwich is humongous and satisfying   dessert i dont even know where to start the brown shugga pie is stupid good it never would have occurred me to order it because i dont sit around thinking about brown sugar but a friend of mine did and i ate almost the whole thing its ooey gooey rich and delicious the key lime pie is also a spectacular pick as is the apple crisp ive had almost every dessert on the menu and not one of them has been a disappointment the carrot cake might be one of the biggest slabs you can get in the entire united states and it is so worth every last caloriei was in town for a short visit and decided to do some neighborhood exploration i was in the garden district and wanted some cheaper lunch options i found this place had sliders and fries i think both were very good especially their chicken sliders but there is more the doughnuts they are so so good doughy perfectly pillowy and fresh the flavor combinations are neat creative one last thing too service is great really helpful and nice staffas a native new englander  longtime florida transplant myself having been raised and brought up with these cold water crustaceans among the many other seafood delicacies forever shaping my palate and spoiling me to anything else calling itself a lobster yes youfloridacaribbean

am always at my happiest when i know i can rely on an authentic new england seafood marketshanty near me oh and did i mention affordable  i cant think of a visit where the lobster haven staff has not been helpful in assisting me in plucking out my lobsters from one of their many tanks along with their fresh ipswich steamer clams just chillin in their very own cozy tanks theyll steam them up for you right there should you choose bring them home or relax at one of the few tables within this lobster shack or in their newer room to accommodate a larger party  among the traditional new england staples such as ipswich clams maine lobster sea scallops cod haddock or freshly made clam chowder etc they carry a ridiculous variety of other fresh and frozen seafood from our gulf coast region ie

louisiana crawfishandwell once again they do not disappoint there either 599 per lb last time i picked some up fyi  just 1 week ago  this place is a must for all seafood lovers and for those seeking a

yogurt and merguez sausage for my birthday brunch a few years ago which i still crave the grilled octopus is awesome but my favorite may be the manti which are spicy lamb dumplings if the dips of the day include the pumpkinfeta dip definitely order it its amazing their baklava and cardamom ice cream are heavenly whenever i walk by and see people on the street enjoying their meals and wine the corner is so inviting i also love to inspect the quirky decor and handwritten signs these are just the things that make kanella uniquely specialwe were craving vietnamese food after 2 days of southern

to us to see how everything was excellent staff service also we shall be back next time we come back into townbest coffee in town  its not easy to make a soy or almond milk latte and they do it the best and consistently each time  they have a great assembly line system at the cash register and barista station that keeps the line moving fast  even at peak times when its fully crowded i never have a long wait  they have a couple glutenfree baked goods to select from that are also top notch  sometimes i get a chamomile magic bowl and the hot apple cider as an alternative to caffeinewarm friendly atmosphere and amazing product we were firsttime buyers there and will certainly be back the ham sausage is excellent and the beef jerky is amazing the rib eye steaks were also excellent no more chainstore meat for ustheres not much to say except that this place is magical  awesome candies pralines made on the spot great fudge and a cool building enter on decatur exit on peters  they are so

supporting the arts in our communitythis place was worth the wait  their lobster pasta was really good i guess a quaint neighborhood bakery that has been around for over 40 years they are known for their delicious doberge cannoli and king cakes during mardi gras  deliciouseasy glide into tuesday evening cooler buddies dipa capped with the shade tree ipa fold in a perfect playlist and youre good to go love this placeknown for their enormous salads and toasted sandwiches my favorite is the california style pizzas   i tend to always go back to the deborah pizza  its a pesto style with roasted onions and chicken  i have them leave off the tomatoes because it makes it too watery   the indulgent every so often choice is the pimento cheese pizza  this is greasy so blot the pie with a few napkins and double up on the lipotor and enjoy   i became a member of their roundtable elite which is a email list that sends you specials and new menu items   on a stalker note there are loads of nashville cast stars eating there all the timedelicious food fast and friendly service we had the el jaffe banana short stack and breakfast enchiladas everything was perfection the pork enchiladas were to die for so yummy and my pancakes were divine cooked to perfection nice and fluffy golden brown next time im in reno this is where well go for breakfast or lunch the owner and the 2 other guys working were just so friendly toothe quintessential coffee and wine bar   this venue is adorably decorated and spacious and it has the perfect amount of noisebustle and fabulous treats to choose from   i am a coffee shop snob and this will absolutely be my goto in the citythis location is by far the best of all the caf du monde ive tried during my visit in nola the beignets are consistently not oily and freshly cooked whenever we came here been in this location 3 times in 6 days back in dec 2017 whats more there ice mocha and cafe mocha are also really good its not too sweet and works well with the beignets wish they would open a location in socalgreat place to order a fresh bagel and have a relaxing seat and enjoy breakfastfinally a true nongmo organic juice and power juice bar joint that serves meats  protein they have organic chicken i was so excited i ordered a second entree to take home great for bulletproof diet and paleo peepsare you kidding me this is without a doubt some of the best food ive ever had my life the bread is the best and i cannot believe the chocolate croissant ambience is wonderful intriguing and very chic people are friendly and kind  coffee looks great but i didnt try it yet i will be back prices are good toonice new place definitely worth checking out  cozy loungelike atmosphere it was my first time trying either kava or kratom teas so i wasnt sure what to get but paul was great and explained both very wellwe stopped in just to randomly check for a few things  who knew you could find birch beer in arizona other than that we snagged some vosges chocolate mos bacon bar is the best strawberry pocky and random other goodies the prices are a bit high but most items are imported or hard to find so its kind of understandable i think we drooled over the bakery section for about 20 minutes  everything looked amazing nice place to find unusual ingredients and really fresh meat and seafoodwonderful establishment with a great selection of always super fresh seafood  their in season soft shell crabs are melt in your mouth good  hands down the best local fish monger in bucks county well worth the drive to buckinghamas a first year beekeeper i researched online and read as many books as i could for close to a year before actually getting my bees and even after all my research i still find that i have questions and whenever i stop by isabees jane scott or kat have always been very helpful answering my novice questions they have an excellent variety of merchandise on hand and always take the time to answer my questions never any upselling just always pleasant conversation and exchange of ideas to get me exactly what i need keep up the good work isabeeswe visited one morning for brunch and were very impressed we started with fried green tomatoes and they were amazing seriously the best fried green tomatoes we have ever had the catfish and grits were also very good excited to return for dinner and listen to some jazz musicthis location is just wonderful   i live very close nearby and frequent this location a few times a week even during busy times they are always wellstaffed moving the lines quickly and remaining friendly   the manager one of the managers anthony is really nice and hes been on the register a few times when ive been there i think its great that the manager pitches in and helps out when theyre busy hes very friendly and helpful and made a great recommendation last time i was in  honey almond cream cheese on their cinnamon crunch bagel omg wow good   thanks for such a pleasant experience will be back again and againamazingly good the only place ive found paneer butter masala locally and its so good cant wait to try some of the other vegetarian selectionsthis place is right around the corner and im sooo glad that it is delicious barbecue thats decently priced will returnthe caesar salad is worth the trip alone and i highly recommend the proscuitto and spinach pizza paul is a great guy and every time ive been in there hes gone out of his way to say hello and check that everyone is pleasedfantastic customer service both wholesale shopping and auto services my tire was flat once and the mechanics went above and beyond truly trying to fix it but eventually i had to get it repaired at a full service shop the costco employee felt bad and even offered to partially reimburse me for something that broke when they were trying to fix my tire i turned them down but its the thought that counts i will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me  saturdays and sundays are the days my boyfriend and i like to shop here because of all the delicious samples the employees are all helpful cheerful and respectful place is clean youll find bargains and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere some of the generic costco kirkland signature items are just as good if not better than brand names  best of all i hear you dont even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices 150 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills 10 for a delicious whole 18 pizza too good to be true and yet it is  with competitive prices gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy and membership perks such as travel getaway packages i found i have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon cant say enough good things about this place and the company big fanstupendous customer service and exquisite food my favorite is the japanese pan noodles with marinated steakmuch better than the one on bell rd near red lobster if you live in the area save yourself some time and go here plus there is a drive throughabsolutely amazing cute little restaurant serving breakfast and brunch they have a bunch of unique and tasty mimosas super cool atmosphere and decor food was extremely tasty awesome find during our short stay in tucsoni have never had a bad experience at this sonic the carhops are always friendly and our food always comes out how we order it last time it took about 5 minutes for them to bring out 2 drinks to make up for it they gave us tokens for 2 free rt 44 drinksi love supporting local business they have over 700 different flavour of kcups and tons you can buy individually the staff is very friendly and helpful this is where to go for coffee at homethe best beignets hands down this great shop is located in the most lovely outdoor open air market everyone is very friendly and welcoming a couple new yorkers were eating here when i walked by and their food got my attention i had to take a seat and check things out for myself wow do yourself a favor and find this place while in nolathis was legit and lives up to the hype my friends and i shared the thai sensation thai iced tea and lychee which was perfect the thai ice tea ice cream wasnt too sweet and lychee fruit was used so the mix of the small bits into the ice cream worked out well  3 toppings with a syrup is included for 7 dollars with tax for the novelty and show while they prepare your treat i think the price is very reasonable the toppings i got were mochi strawberry pocky sticks and condensed milk i think the picture will speak for itself   they opened 2 months ago and they will have no trouble attracting attention as a tourist to the area i was glad to stumble upon this location great spot to hang out bring a date or just get some solid ice cream   important to mention this ice cream will not be creamy common sense how can something that is prepared and rolled in this manner be creamy like say gelato if you come in with a realistic expectation youll have a better experience this wont be the best ice cream youll ever have but the appearance and novelty makes it worth tryingthree letters wow  food was excellent and relatively cheap for the fq  our waitress kerry was excellent  i had the big easy breakfast which came with lots of food that i could not finish  the pancakes were the best part of the meal  glad we skipped the hotels breakfast of pastries to eat here  i would highly recommendlove this place visited on a flash trip to nola and loved the donuts cant wait to be backkkrecently spoke to dani the manager after some back and forth discussion and some stern replies we managed to work out a few kinks in the delivery process didnt want to knock the place for bad delivery service its something that is hard in this area due to all of the new buildings going up so after a few mins over the phone he smoothed everything over communication is key my friends now back the the pizza its as good as it gets in university cityi am surprised the average rating is 35 stars for what it is a soccer bar i think this place is great and i actually prefer this location to the mass ave one  the decor makes you feel like youre at an english pub there are tvs everywhere so its a great place to watch a game  the beer selection is great the service is great and the food is good ive had their chicken salad sandwich wings and fish and chips and all three are good better than your typical bar foodhad a great experience place is really clean and has cool decor service was prompt and intuitive the food was delicious make sure to leave room for dessert the dessert menu is a picture book from their bakery prices were great as wellafter hearing good things about the screamery i thought id better check it out good location and very friendly staff to greet you with all kinds of information about why their ice cream is the bestest i was able to taste several different flavors before setting on chocolate peppermint i thought id try that sonoran chocolate but was told it was quite fiery maybe ill try it on another day  my final choice was very tasty i wish they offered more flavors but maybe that will come with time but other than that its a wonderful neighborhood place to grab some delicious ice creami stopped in to buy my favourite macaroons from where else duchess when low and behold there is a store next door oh goodness it is a whole store by duchess filled with the most amazing well like the name says provisions  there are cookie cake and pie making equipment a howto kit for duplicating their famous macaroons all the gadgets one would need to bake a masterpiece are in this delicious little side venture they even have a wall stocked with jams honeys caramels chocolates nuts salts sugars and other high end super must have ingredients to wow your taste buds and show off to your dinner guests i bought a delightful crystallized honey as well as a jar of salted caramel that is so amazing it could be drizzled on a dust bunny and make it taste divine i also added to my insane cookiecutter collection which i hide from my other half so he doesnt think im kitchen cuckoo oh wait i think hes on to me   this is definitely a must visit store if you are a culinary wizard or just like to wingit it is a goto destination to pick up that perfect hostess gift or for your super foodie friend and even a 4 jar of something in its beautiful package will make anyone feel like a duke or a duchessyou will feel like you were transplanted suddenly to europe  i love mazzaro  great place to come to fill up your fridge with healthy  and not so healthy  goodies  fair prices and excellent wines and cheese  heaveni found myself in the big easy for a convention back in the beginning of may i stayed about 15 miles from the convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me i went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that i felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast as i was strolling along magazine street i peaked in the window of what i thought was a pastrycakesweets stuff kind of place bittersweet confections for a moment i thought maybe they werent open yet because it wasnt crowded with a line out the door like others i had passed  then i glanced over at the menu and i spotted the breakfast menu  i said to myself give it a try why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere youre right here dude so i walked in and that is when my 3 day relationship started  yep it was so damn good i went back every day on my morning walk to the convention day one i asked to speak to the chef a lovely lady full of passion about her food and family recipes she makes a damn good biscuit i wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal healthy portions and i didnt want anyone to think i was dissatisfied she smiled thanked me and said ill see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after i could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day i would find someone along the way who

morning stroll over to bittersweet boom another amazing meal there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes i overheard them say they were on a budget with a

the historic route 66 location  had the lemon crumb concrete my brother had a sundae  both were excellent  very creamy texture and flavor  line was long but was not that bad a wait  a lot of out owners like me but just as many localsthis is literally the best hotel in the french quarter it has a fantastic location and there are many restaurants close by the hotel within walking distance the hotel has the right balance of privacy and services however there are not cabs readily available  but if you walk up the street a bit there is a cab stand the breakfast at the hotel is excellent i will definitely be backthis is my favorite pizza place in tucson great food great service relaxing atmosphere and did i mention the super stix you havent lived until youve tried the super stixi live in the neighborhood and absolutely love this place everything i have ever gotten here has been really good they have a lot of dishes with very unique and distinct flavors overall this is one of my favorite restaurants around they also have a very good lunch special if you are ever nearby on a weekdayour scene its a sunny humid middle of the week day in tampa fl beth t and companion are sitting around doing nothing  me beth t im bored  companion me too lets do something me ok what companion i dunno me brilliant idea flashing lets try this sponge dock place in tarpon springs companion ok  as they drove to the sponge docks located on dodcanese blvd they became hungry the sponge shopping didnt help so they stopped in a little restaurant with mediterranean murals all over the walls   me this looks good you like greek food  companion sure why not   oh the amazingly oily greek salad with potato salad underneath oh the pita and fresh hummus oh the perfectly spiced gyros with french fries oh the sweet sweet baklava   me yum companion yeah  entirely satiated and satisified they moved on down dodacense blvd to shop for more sponges  one can never have enough    and sceneloved the atmosphere here everything in the shop was beautiful and well put together the barista was really great and helped me find a drink that i would like and she was right i loved it definitely will be back next time im in the areathis place is a gem and has been for many years added bonus theyre open til 4am if youre craving really good fried shrimp check this place outi was really feeling for coffee and was nowhere near a starbucks so i decided to stop at this tim hortons i was immediately impressed with how clean the store was i have never been to a tim hortons before and maryann was super sweet and spent a lot of time explaining the menu the iced coffee that i eventually decided on was perfect you guys have got yourselves a new regular101 was delightful stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour  two for one drinks possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks but we both got boba teas instead  the scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer they came out hot crispy and a little oily delicious  the tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious all the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory sort of sweet flavor combo cilantro sweet sauce and a few other things i dont remember off the top of my head  the popcorn chicken was also excellent tiny very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad i didnt try the potato salad but heard it was more of a macaroni salad   i highly recommend taiwan 101 food is cooked quickly staff are nice and everything ive tried so far is absolutely deliciousoutstanding  the top shelf margarita was perfect and we loved the pork pastor and the red drum highly recommendi love this place this past summer i would go here almost every other day to buy a different kind of donut for my family to try the atmosphere is great service is great and the food is amazing not only are their donuts tasty as heck but their sliders are to die for as well if you are a donut fan or just a sweettooth you got to try this place note the food truck that you might see around town imo does not have the same quality go to the location on magazine stnever gets old i get the chocolate malt with light on the chocolate best ice cream custard thing i have ever had in my lifevery very happy i tried this wonderful cantina it seems they have a new chef and my first meal here was amazing if you are a connoisseur of mexican cuisine please try this place i had veggie enchiladas w green sauce and it was flavorful and complex and not watery like most other mexican veggie  dishes around town   im so impressed and happy to find this gem my partner had  chicken enchiladas with red sauce and refried beans  the red sauce reminded me of the sauce an immigrant woman i worked with used to make for potlucks  i know i am shamelessly gushing but if you read my other reviews then you will know that its not typical the bartender iris is very helpful and was a great server also one more thing i want to mention the spicy margarita it is now my new favorite drink in town it has cilantro jalapeo and i believe cucumber and it is amazingcappuccios is by far one of the most amazing butcher shops in the city  on my first visit i was unsure of what to get  i popped in shortly before the place was going to close for the day but that didnt matter  the employees were beyond friendly and helpful  after some discussion i decided to go with some pork chops which had to be cut  no problem the staff was willing to cut the chops to the thickness of my liking  and man were they some of the best pork chops weve ever had  i had such a great experience that i went back 2 days later this time with my husband a lover of all things meaty  we were again greeted and helped by the exceptional staff  the experience you will have at cappuccios is worth the trip alone but their meats are also exceptional  i think weve found our local butcher shopsuperfabulous i chose to patronize this store during my trip to new orleans simply based on the yelp feedback i was not disappointed fabulous this liquor store was more charming and delivered better service to me than the omni hotel the owner and his seasoned staff 24 plus years of loyal employees were so gracious plus they delivered to my hotel  ignore the outdated and dirty comments from others this place is quaint the best i mean the best bloody mary you can get for cheap folks  delicious with plenty of garnish i say they were better and more affordable than the bloody marys at pat obriens  i cannot wait for my next trip to nawlins and i will be back to this jointno doubtafter a full day of snorkeling the ice cream was delicious  it is located inside of the hotel but if you ask they will let you park for free  they had a wide variety of flavors and starbucks coffee  seating is in an air conditioned room with old fashioned tablespizza was delicious had the meat eaters pizza the pizza was perfectly proportioned and filled me up and i had to take the rest to go i will definitely try and persuade the franchise owner to let me open my own blaze pizza in biloxi ms i can imagine i would do a lot of business god willingi had been stalking food trucks for some time when i finally landed somewhere that had five all together most were selling sample size items for a small prize at wctt you got three tacos for the same prize loved loved loved them served on corn tortillas with meat perfectly cooked you couldnt ask for more and friendly service to boot if you see this truck in your area high tail it over therefabuloso this place i hit every single time i fly to tampa  so deliciously tasty    the rice pudding is to die for    vmy boyfriend and i dined here after buying a summer in the city discount card for tucson wed been wanting to try out new restaurants this one included so the added discount gave us that extra push everything about our experience was great we were seated immediately and our waiter came by shortly after he gave great recommendations on the wine and the specials i ordered the pasta dish of the day which was so fabulous he had  the bouillabaisse which was also delicious we were too full for dessert but the ones we saw being carried to other tables looked amazing our server was very attentive but not overbearing the atmosphere was lovelyintimate but still had the feeling of being in a public place which we like it was a great experienceif you love pizza brooklyn pizza  cafe is where too go i eat here regularly and its always great the staff is really nice the pizza is always made fresh when i order it and its ready in less than 1015 minutes when i order it to goive had about all of their sandwiches and visit this place when im in the area during lunch  i think their bread is great and their prices are phenomenal  i also enjoy their spring rollsflaming cheese was best they were a little confused when they sat us but great and cant wait to go back for dinnerdelicious both the burritos and vietnamese come often for pho and great vietnamese food but tried a burrito today for the first time i am hookedmy family has been customers of georges for years you pay for what you get the quality of the food is premier and they dont hold back on portion size their cheesesteaks are amazing chopped steak and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their char platters which is legit their char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken ive ever had they make their own sauce so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use franks red hot i have yet to have something on their menu that i didnt likeso my girlfriend is from chicago and id been searching forever to try and find her a place in tampa that had chicago style pizza shes pretty picky about it of course shes been used to the main 3 places up there that do it a little differently of course i was excited anyways because id never had chicago style pizza before  after all the worriedness that she had she was extremely happy with both the pizza and the awesome vintagey atmosphere the waitress was very friendly as well the selfserve beer cooler had a pretty good selection of craft beer though i would have loved to see more of my favorites there also the greek salad was easily one of the best id ever had in my entire life it was pretty epic  overall we had an awesome experience and will absolutely be going back again in the near futurefantastic mexican truck   the guys there are very kind and polite  the tacos are superb  tostado was delicious  veggies seem very fresh and clean    only outdoor seating  ice cold canbottle drinks and shadevery simplegreat food great drinks and wonderful service good for a date family outing and to take visitorsthe morning cuban it could be renamed gout on a plate but holy ht is this open faced breakfast sandwich good it comes on a thick slice of toasted bread the type they use for french toast with roasted pulled pork swiss cheese ham 2 fried eggs on top with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top creating a moat of nottoospicy green goodness holy sht this makes me think of the morning after breakfast after partying in miamis south beach with some bangin cuban honeys yes its like that this sht is soooo bomb i kept muttering expletives to myself as i dug through the plate with my fork damnnnn  actually even better than the normal morning cuban if you ask for a small cup of their house chorizo gravy thats even better with the openfaced morning cuban than the green house salsa   oh speaking of house they were playing some nice jazzysoulful house music while i was there pretty nice for atmosphere they alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while i was there i wasnt sure if it was a mix from their private collection or if it was just pandora   either way big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music  the peanut butter brownies are good but the rest of the baked goods didnt interest me i think 5th st bakehouses strength lies not in the baked goods but in their awesome sandwiches like the morning cuban in fact i want to go there right nowso glad we found this place on yelp had a huge portion of delicious red beans and rice with pork shank and the boudin balls definitely recommend this place if youre in new orleans not far from french quarter with free parkingthis small but impressive sidekick to the much larger and more lavish oxford exchange makes a quick convenient alternative to those who want something good to go in a hurry  there is limited seating inside and the menu is not nearly as extensive as its namesake but there are plenty of of satisfying ways to appease your appetite sate your thirst for iced coffee get a boost from a juice or make a baked good grab and go  be sure to peruse the chilled section for all sorts of readytoeat goodies  oxford exchange has been a maverick at shaking up the status quo and this tiny countertop  and counterpart  carries on that tradition quite welljust had my first panera delivery experience and it was great the delivery was on time and the nicest delivery guy ive ever met delivered my lunch he was friendly and polite and seemed like he was having his best day ever max delivered great food with a contagious smile good stuff panerai shop here on the regular good quality authentic product im first generation and brought up on home made polish food thanks czerws for the taste of homewe were visiting philly for the weekend a some friends recommended hipcityveg we picked up dinner for the kids and everything was delicious and the staff was wonderful highly recommended and hope to be back soongreat combination of japanese and korean food the sushiya roll and the curry kutsu are my favorite in the menu everything ive tried so far tastes fresh and flavorful for sure my goto asian spot in ivi took the free tour that lasted about 45 minutes tour guides were knowledgeable with a side of comical i learned a whole lot of history and their processes in a short tour if you dont want to go on the tour its still worth stopping by to see all of the memorabilia in the common area the complimentary beer at the end of the tour is as fresh as you can get deliciousawesome place very dope setting large party can crash and chill staff here super nice i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation awesome great place great beer  thanks all the staff for great hospitalitymy favorite pizza place in the area  friendly staff and the biggest slices of pizza anywhere  for 450 you can get any one of up to 10 different gourmet slices  the margherita and the buffalo chicken are not to be missed  great outdoor dining area i frequently ride my bicycle there have a slice and ride it off home nice small dining room in the back delicious and the waitress was awesome  we stayed there for lunch for almost 3 hours and never felt rushed and we never felt like we were overstaying our welcome  great food  great servicethe staff spent over 10 minutes on the phone with me answering all of my ridiculous questions about my serious dietary needs  what they have to offer two thumbs up for the patience and kindness they offered meif youre looking for a great place to start your day id go here great place for a simple breakfast thatll fuel you up for a day full of festivities portions are huge prices are great and the place is cute and quaint what more can you ask for a breakfast spotkarma is very delicious i typically get the acai bowls or the energy squares that they sell i come here quite a few times in a month the only negative thing i can say is that when i order my bowls sometimes it has almonds and others it doesnt it kind of pisses me off because i love almonds so i expect them each time too little of a detail to ruins someones day about but i just feel it should be a little more consistentive tried many ice cream shops in new orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list it has by far the best ice cream in town   as soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time it reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the south it definitely has that old world charm   there are so many delicious flavors to try and its usually hard to choose just one  however over time and many flavor tests i find that i tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors my personal favorites at the creole creamery are the entire chocolate section  located on your left as soon as you walk in more specifically the chocworkorange a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor the butterscotch english toffee soooo good and lavender honey who doesnt love lavender  whats your favorite flavorreno is not known for its chinese food but that doesnt mean a diamond in the rough doesnt exist after scouring a dozen or so hole in the wall chinese shops i have finally found two local joints that i will call home to my china tooth aka chinese food craving    when i want a late night bite of generals chicken or honey garlic shrimp sf kitchen is my top choice the setting and decor isnt quite asian crawfish but that doesnt matter once your first bite is taken my wife and i love honey walnut shrimp and we will try anything that resembles that on any menu at sf kitchen you will not be disappointed with the honey garlic shrimp usually there is the issue of too much batter or sauce thats too sweet or too few shrimp or ect but alas this dish is quite perfect as i rant and rave about the shrimp dish the sezchuan beef was on point as well with that in mind i cant stop thinking about that shrimp dish   now that ive said my piece go out and try it you will find a new home for your china tooth tootruly one of the places where your eyes are bigger than your stomach and even so you wish your stomach could double its capacity   the donuts here are imaginative and original i had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning   new orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while i didnt get a chance to try the one at winks in the french quarter i imagine the ones at district are a good representation its a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it generally im more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful i could have eaten a half dozen no sweat but there were other items to try   district has croquenuts available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich i chose the monte cristo for its sweet and savory combination gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut this was a magical creation get it if you have the chance  finally to top of my donut extravaganza i chose the miso olive oil praline bacon donut its a mouthful to say but wasnt to consume such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut i chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso olive oil and praline each hit their notes with every bite simply wonderful   not to forget was the the vietnamese iced coffee to wash it all down it was the jolt i needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts   you bet ill make another or several stops next time im in new orleanscallys is in my opinion the best tea shop in edmonton the baked goods are superb and the teas are of excellent quality one of my favourites is the rose tea  it smells just like real rose petals and the taste comes through nicely in the brew  the atmosphere is perfect so all in all visiting callys results in an excellent tea experienceincredible food the owner is so hospitable and ales everyone feel like family had the lamb gyro and the flavor was over the top loved their tzatziki sauce was delicious loved their greek salad as well definitely recommend to anyone wanting authentic greek foodi cant wait to go back its unbelievably full of everything  anything you could possibly want from an italian market  you can eat there as well unfortunately it closes very early on saturday but we didnt know  were lucky to get inside before they locked it a lot of items were already in the process of being put away so we didnt buy very much couldnt even get bread or eat there i was starving so i grabbed some cheese  ate some  of course saved the package to pay for it        need a lot of time to meander around theres so much variety its sensory overload what we did buy was deliciouswe were heading out for brunch in the garden district and literally made the cabby pull over as soon as we saw this place  hey  sounds like a bunch of good things rolled into one  it was early so we didnt have the sliders but the donuts and coffee were exceptional  the donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first but i was wrong  they were actually well balanced with good flavors  they take coffee seriously too  i tried their cold nitro brew which seemed more like a guinness than an iced coffee  it wasnt exactly my style so switched it for a latte instead but i applaud them for trying to innovateour favorite little taco place we always get the steak chicken and fish tacos we looove the queso highly recommendthis tour was great  the tour guide provided us with a wealth of knowledge not only about the food but about new orleans history and its culture i strongly recommend this to anyonemy partner and i were out of towners for a wedding which took place at spassos it was such a good spot for a wedding dinner the space was open staff accommodating to our needs we enjoyed the food and our glasses never ran empty you couldve rolled us out of there after our 5course mealincredible red chile or green burritos and impossibly fresh tortillas minimalistic decorfirst place i ate in the area and it was sooo good my friend and i both ordered pasta but the pizzas looked good from afar they have beer and wine available which is great when you dont have time for byobhad lunch with girlfriends  so happy to finally get down there super yummy  the cashier could have been more friendly and helpful but ill be back for surethis tour is highly recommended as a local they do give you a good taste of new orleans from gumbo to jambalaya to a muffaletta to a poboy very good tour this is my second tme taking it preston was an animated tour guide and very fun to be aroundso yummy  we were visiting friends and craving some ice cream so i looked on yelp and found this place we got a cookies and cream milkshake and a chocolate almond in a cone both were delicious and the staff was very friendlythis is a hidden gem this is my first review but i had to give it 5 stars for the amazing crepes at a good price i also had a delicious caramel milkshake the crepes here are cheaper than the market and they dont come in a cone when i come back to new orleans ill be coming here  my mum and i really enjoyed itso something with this truck must have changed because i just went here for lunch and it was on point i got the bbq meatball sandwich the guy is definitely a joker and says whats on his mind but nothing was insulting meatballs were hot and had soft texture sandwich roll is fantastic hoping people give this place a go because id go back for sureby far the best brunch in tucson one of the rare places that serves a bloody mary with a beer back  service is consistently great expect a wait fridaysunday order the benedict and the madras mimosaschlafly bottleworks is more than just a microbrewery yes they do brew their own beer onsite tours are available and they have a nice bar area with plenty of seating  they also have great affordable food im a big fan of their burgers but have never ordered anything at schlaflys that i didnt like they also have a large outside patio area and sponsor a weekly farmers market during the summer on their parking lot  i appreciate that they use local sustainable food and that the entire building was smoke free even the bar before the smoking ban went into place they keep a fire going outside all winter in the patio space which gives the smokers a warm place to huddle   ive also been to several events with the back room with its own bar and their bartenders will let you taste the beer until you find one you likebest pralines in town   they are generous with samples so go in there and try all the flavors original rum chocolate coconut etc   bring me some when you go seriouslylove the smells of chocolates here as you walk in the door  amazing and creative chocolate team here that can create just about anything out of chocolate icing nuts dried fruit  what we love   gourmet chocolate dipped pretzel rods mint meltaways dark and milk chocolate  chocolate covered orange peels bourbon chocolates   also a great place to find or special order your favorite candies    lastly ive got to mention  the treats they put together for special events and holidayswe were looking for a dairy free ice cream place to take the kids bam gelato when we walked in my kids both instantly got super excited the display of gelato is beautiful very fancy lots of colors the menu also included lots of paninis and other little snacks and soups it would be a great place for lunch if youre looking for something quick but not fast food and greasy we had the vanilla and the strawberry kids size gelato for our first trip we will definitely be going back again it is a great stop for family walk time too we definitely recommendthese donuts were amazing nothing negative i have to say about this place i was a little sad that they didnt have my strawberry donut i was looking forward to very much  i did get a bit of a hard time about wanting a chicken sandwich with a glazed donut being told they couldnt do that but hey i ended up with a chicken glazed donut sandwich which i really appreciated after being told they couldnt do the staff was very kind and i loved walking in back to use the restroom  seeing the huge deep fryer full of their freshly made donuts biting into one of their donuts was nice because theyre so freaking delicate they almost melt when you eat them the texture was amazing and the chicken was even a good quality i was very impressed  i will never look at krispy kreme the samefoodie call always there when i turn around at a cool dive bar or my homebase for bama gamedays the burgers are always the  best my boyfriend and i like to split them just as a nice hearty snack just tell them to cut it in half if you are splitting a burger with someone ive had the 1 and its always amazing and we just had the jalapeo burger bc my bf loves spicy things and its his bday and omg this burger is also perfect im not surprised i probably wouldnt have been able to eat a whole one because its so deliciously spicy and i cant handle much spice but it was still extremely tasty like alwayslittle puzzled by some of the negative reviews i ordered the bbq sub this afternoon and it was pretty epic would definitely order againwe had been driving around for some time on a weekday last week  this was our last time in town as we had sold our home in alton  so after going to 3 different restaurants and finding that they are closed for various reasons we decided we would come here  wow  seriously everything happens for a reason and wow   we were maybe one of the first patrons in the restaurant upon opening  the ambiance is lovely  we were greeted warmly initially and the warmness continued throughout our visit  as i said prior the ambiance is lovely the decor is so just want to take it home  the service was impeccable our waitress was attentive friendly knowledgeable and smiley  omg the food  the food  we had their summer special   holy cow were they fantastic  entrees were   seafood shrimp alfredo and our friend and i had the steak  honestly you cannot go wrong with anything that you order from tonys  top notch old school dining experience which is rarecame to smileys after reading other yelp reviews and i was not disappointed i ordered the beef gyro platter to go and the portion was well worth the money myself and another person split the meal and there was still some left over the gyro meat is cut off of a huge slab right in front of you dont let its appearance put you off its delicious the rice is delicious and doesnt feel heavy or greasy like some that ive had from other establishments in the past with the platter you also get a huge helping of hummus and a bag full of delicious pita and a little salad on the side ill definitely be back here to try some of the other menu items i definitely need to try the baklavai never write reviews on yelp and this place was so good that i felt the need to login and write a review the poached pear donut was ridiculous this place is doing everything rightthis was our first experience eating lunch at cheddars our server was joey  we really appreciated that our food was made after we ordered it rather than being prepared hours before  joey brought us coffee andmy test of an attentive serverkeep our coffee and water filled up  when we were low on coffee instead of warming up our coffee he brought new cups  this was typical of the excellent service      the food was superb  i had a mediumrare steak it was actually cooked mediumrare which does not always happen  the flavor of all our entrees and side orders was very tasty      we plan to go back frequently  heartily recommended  the wait is noted in other reviews and its because of the quality of food  if you want to avoid a line go to a fast food placeif you come tarpon springs and dont have meal at hellas thats gonna be a helluva good reason to come back to ts we had a gang of 11 of us that came here for the day away from st petersburg to chill out and feed our mugs my fellow yelpers thank you once again for leading us to the greenest pastures as i am now beginning to recite to myself  as i walk through the valley of hunger i shall fear no starvation for yelp thou art with me amen  we had to wait about a 12 hour to be seated as this place was hopping we got a table for 11 and were a bit cramped but no one was complaining we started of with the flaming cheese and fried smelts as the appetizer and they were amazing we all ordered the different dishes and there were empty plates at the end  i had the gyro sandwich and have yet to taste one as good we all ambled out of there and ready for a snooze in anticipation of more partying tonight we will definitely be backsooooo good  fav spot downtown classy intimate and more quiet than most dining places  drinks are phenomenal i recommend the margarita  they have a great dining room tons of booths  also they do rooftop dining   enjoy your experience heretonys is the most amazing place youve never heard of my husband and i eat breakfast there every sunday and it is the perfect spot to make memories the donuts are amazing and for 5 were both sufficiently happy its the

not going to il posto nearly every morning  this place has everything id want from my neighborhood cafe fit with the best coffee iced green tea with mint bagels caper berries and their homemade pumpkin chocolate chip delights  the best place to go to relax after a hard week with some food and coffee  do yourself a favor and get one of their homemade oreo cookiesamazing alligator wings so delicious professional  guys work here high recommendthis is my favorite brewery on brewerytown the beer is absolutely amazing and the menu is super unique the food is healthy but with enough flavor to make you feel like youre eating something complexity unhealthy its a small restaurant but once you find your little corner you wont want to leave sample each unique beer have a conversation with the amazing bartenders and youll feel like a local in no timei was fortunate to come across this lovely place as a sushi lover ive always been apprehensive about sushi burritos because it sounds like too much rice and not enough variety i was very wrong the sushi burrito is perfection it is the perfect lunch because its fresh and light the serving size is plentiful and the ingredients are very fresh   it is set up like a chipotle and you pick what ingredients you would like i would recommend adding a topping with some crunch like wonton crisps because it really adds to the overall texture the tuna is definitely my favorite overall its an awesome lunch spot highly recommendwe stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint   the service was friendly and prompt  we would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were greatthey have a surprisingly good ahi poke here made fresh every morning and if you want them to make a spicy ahi just call in the morning so they can make a spicy batch of tuna   they also have a great organic fruit and vegetable selection thatll keep me coming back here their staff is super friendly and always willing to help   they even have that cool amazon locker grocery system here im way too indecisive to order my groceries online but its a good think to keep in mind when wanting to shop here  i can see it coming in handy if you just need to grab groceries on a jiffy just pay in advanced and type in your locker code   their prices are very reasonable here for their quality of goods i would definitely recommend this grocery storei am totally infatuated with mod  their mod pizza salad is amazing  you pick and choose your own ingredients  walking distance from my place of employment super speedy service and the best lemonade i have ever hadnew favorite spot in reno best muscles ive had in a sushi joint great menu options that arent the same old rolls everywhere else has the flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet so be forewarned dont hesitate to check this place out great atmosphere and the best sushimy favorite place to get a hot chai in town they offer a selection of nondairy alternatives including my favorite almond milk they also offer 3 different types of chai  all brewed tea and not that sugary starbucks stuff if you go in the morning they have a wide variety of croissants quiche cinnamon rolls and other yummy stuffexceptional greek food authentic and well done greatly situated in the sponge docks of tarpon springs and they handled my party of 15 well our server nonda was very kind and most certainly very greek    the food was well done especially the classic greek salad pork souvlaki and gyro the seafood was great too the octopus was tender with a great char and the snapper was very flavorful my only regret was that i didnt have time for the bakerydelicious pastries and coffee friendly  accommodating staff and open bright environment had the butterscotch bowtie it was big but so good i finished it all highly recommendyeah ill go 5 stars great little shop nice employees who dont roll their eyes when you ask for many many samples i only got 2 but i really just wanted to keep going   lots of great flavors and ideas going on here the salted caramel is just out of this world its haunting me right now it is a tad bit salty and should definitely not be eaten out of a pretzel cone but its so freaking good i got some peach bellini sorbet that was packed with flavor and so delightfully smooth   prices are pretty reasonable go herecarrot cake was amazing crave it every day since i had it doesnt even compare to previous cakes ive haddelicious red velvet cupcakes absolutely a mustgo if you are in the area definitely going to try to make the effort to stop by whenever im in philly   tried the banana pudding about 2 years ago too and it was fantastic surprisingly no wait its a small shop with great dessertsi had no idea pudding could be this good i went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake or two but they were all out which turned out to be a boon because i probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise we were offered samples of banana pudding peanut butter pudding and strawberry banana pudding each as delicious as the last this stuff is like the hagendazs of pudding rich creamy and indulgent in fact its closer to eating custardy ice cream than any pudding youve ever had well definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gonei doubt that anyone even reads the reviews before going to this place it is so popular around town that everyone knows about it and there is no way to go wrong with it anytime i need any kind of delicious meat coffee or just want to grab a quick bite this is the place to gothis is a local treasure we have lived in the area now for 20 years and every time the heat is on  this is the place to stop to cool down they serve a wide range of food and cooling treats that many flock to especially during the summer we go on a regular basis and will continue to as long as they are open ive never seen a larger or better selection of beer in my life all are sold by the bottle and the prices are awesome the employees are always happy to help and greet you with a genuine smile little known this place also serves sandwiches paninis and wraps the different choices are sometimes exotic but alway delicious but if you know what you want you can always create your own any way you want it if youre on the run you can get anywhere from this location or just grab a table enjoy a beer or two with your sandwich and see whats up and coming in the local community i love this placewe tried this place out because it was in the passport program we started out with a couple glasses of wine and a sauted calamari the calamari was nicely cooked and had a pretty good broth but could have used a little salt   our entrees were great though i had a lamb special which was incredible and my wifes pasta was also very good   a couple weird things 1 the space is a little small to the point where the servers are tripping over each other 2 the music choice was strange for an italian place mid90s country  i wasnt looking for dean martin or anything but it was an odd choicethis tiny mediterranean spot on the corner of 10th and spruce may not look like too much from the outside but once you step inside the experience is sure to blow you away ive been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences both times i visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu   my first bit of advice is if you havent been before and want to know what to order the answer is the cyprus breakfast this meal and it is quite filling has everything you could want for a brunch two extra crispy fried eggs a big slab of ham two pieces of a fried mediterranean cheese some delicious bread and a salad all together on one glorious plate my fianc and i both ordered each time we went because it is that good  this past trip i also ordered the lamb sandwich which was also amazing large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll  another menu item im dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special the way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach for dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko i know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala theyll know what you mean its a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom drizzled in orange infused syrup its outstanding   kanella is special because of more than just the food they have an amazing staff we had the same young waiter both times we went he was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu usually you dont remember the waiter and if you do its never for good reasons the service here actually enhances the experience on top of that there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating i saw the chef who i believe is also the owner leave the kitchen go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table honestly this was really touching to see   i couldnt recommend kanella more highly i will be back again soonthe girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice treat you nicer than your family help you get what you like i also got a grilled cheese its nice to try the local delights   stevie nicks playing overhead   my grilled cheese is a work of art im already excited af the cheese was real not velveeta very very beautiful and comforting it came with sea salted potato chips  the ice tea was made fresh the taste is refreshing  exceedingly delish   free wifi too so you can yelpeverything i have tried here has been excellent service is good and quick staff is friendly and welcoming  groupon has a good dealfavorite brewery in santa barbara area top notch ipas and imperial stouts lots of experimentation and interesting brewsok its 739 am and  i just got my caffeine fix decided to try brooklawn its in a big shop center where i am joining a gym starting my new years resolution early the place clean  moves fast and my salted caramel coffee is perfect luv my flavored coffees at dd def try the waffle sandwich egg cheese its very good but i am trying to cut down on carbs and its hard but def the waffle breakfast sandwich was worth it  def glad i stopped by and bought a thermal stainless for keeping my coffee hot they do a big drive in business  huge line as i pulled up coffee hot and keeping me warm with the very windy chilly morning its starting out  hope it warms up a bit def a warm weather girl at heart check out my new  thermal cup best chinesetaiwanesefusion in reno hands down definitely try the more unique stuff like the sandwiches and pancakes but the old standbys are also good cant really be beat for quality and the price is reasonable too plus boba tea yummy sister and i were visiting arizona all the way from the east coast and our aunt and uncle brought us for breakfast today our server alma was out of this world she had an amazing positive and outgoing personality from the moment we sat down we felt at ease and comfortable her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome  we couldnt asked for a better and more upbeat personality  she definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her  we cant wait to visit again on top of this the food here is phenomenaltnt shrimp and the conch fritters were to die for the lobster roll was really good the appearance on the outside is a little iffy but its a hidden gem on the inside  will definitely be backvery cool place came in for lunch   decor is awesome very open and great natural lighting we checked out upstairs before we left and it was great also they did an awesome job decorating and i was really impressed how well this place was put together so cool to see this old building turned into something so awesome   went for with our family and friends table of 7 we were seated quickly service was prompt orders were correct we had 3 burgers pulled pork mac n cheese and the kale and cheese dip between all of us and not one of us was disappointed great food fries were crispy but not overdone and burgers were delicious cooked perfectly and nice and juicy   beers great tasty my wife had a taster and all were really good neither of us are stout fans but it will still good and we both loved the ipa   we all agreed that we cant wait to come down for drinks and dinner with no kiddos so we can try the whiskeydelicious ice cream with topping fudge and raspberry toppings are great well definitely come back here in the future there are still a lot of things to try they only dont have espresso coffeelet me be frank and say i am a universal schlafly fan i like the schlafly family their products each restaurant and their presence in the st louis community this review is based on several experiences   bottleworks great beer and a nice atmosphere you can bring your entire family a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot food is of great quality and nice quantity   waitstaff are some of the best in the city i have never ever been disappointed with a server manager buser or host one time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season my dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasnt able to find it anymore 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a minipint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of dutyi love this place best sushi in tampa the staff is always friendly and dies a great job ive never had a bad experience here you can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table they have free wifi so you can make it a working meal  they do deliver which is another bonus  ive had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldnt figure out how our condo gate workedgreat bowls  sauce all of the ingredients were fresh and healthy service was great im going to become a regular at this placeevething about this resturant is great 1 brew there own soy sauce 2 service amazing  3 food fresh creative  amazingly good 4 everything about this small south jersey resturant is the best around 5 can not wait to returnclearly the word has been out about this breakfast spot for a long time and while we waited in line like everyone else does when they come here it moved surprisingly fast they offer up cups of coffee for those waiting outside and thankfully we had an unseasonably warm december morning  the prices are cheap the staff is pleasant and the pancakes well they were fantastic and im not much of a pancake guy their fried eggs and sausage patties were both enjoyable as wellnothing has changed since my last review their donuts are still the best in town hands down theyve added delicious donut holes to their line if scrumptious products their breakfast and lunch sandwiches are made to order many choices to pick from if you havent been to tonys donuts youre missing the boat when you go tell george and john that i sent you had a gyro plate was delicious bear hummus and gyro i have had in a long time  lebanese tea was perfect alsoyum yum yum salads pizza and sushi are all great i dont even love pizza but i love lulus olive oil athenian i have been going to cyranos for close to 30 years  it has long been the place to take your datespouse for a late night desert  i have many great memories taking my girlfriend and later my wife for a intimateromantic rendezvous as their staff perform their cherries jubilee tableside  i have visited cyranos dozens of time and have never had a bad experience  the food is outstanding and their deserts are even better  the wait staff always seems friendly and helpful  every time i go it always seems the place is extremely busy a sign that they are doing something right after all these years  but i have never felt rushed they have always made me feel like i am their only customer  while i think they are known for their of the charts desserts their regular menu is outstanding as well  just thinking about the coffee rubbed tenderloin makes me drool  the chicken spiedini is another favorite  if you want something quick and lite they have a variety of soups and sandwiches as well   did i mention the cocktails well they are fabulous as well  the happy hour martinis are only 5  i hope to go for another 30 yearswell worth the wait my mother and i went on a monday morning around 9am the wait was about 20 minutes we thought we were going to have to wait for hours but we were pleasantly surprised the line moved really fast for us our waitress michelle was incredibly welcoming and helpful she made our experience at the pancake pantry top notch please do yourself a favor and order the sweet potato pancakes and pair them with the cinnamon cream out of this worldan amazing and innovative new establishment we stopped in on a weekend trip from vegas good was excellent bone marrow was stellar and the brews were top notch the corn whiskey was excellent and the service was friendly with a touch of class we enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to enjoy more of its diverse menu and beer selection  most definitely worth a shot and reno is lucky to have this great option for food beer and whiskey connoisseurslooking for a break from regular ice cream this is the spot just like they do it in big cities they brought these handmade desserts to our city very yummyi love this store each time im in carpenteria monthly i visit this store and its juicesmoothiesandwich bar daily sometimes twice daily except sunday because they arent open sad  i love their aliens nectar and green lantern juices  im addicted their acai bowls are out of this world delicious also when they make a smoothie with dates it ends up smooth versus the place across the street that cant seemml to make juice or smoothies that flow easily up straws  get the cocoanut smoothie with date butter  you wont be sorry fellow chocolate lovers or one if the pineapple coconut smoothies oh so good  the prices at this store are on par with other natural grocers staff is super friendly and i swear they put extra love in each item tip them   i wish they were open sundaythe food is awesome there is a drive through and its open late this place is perfect for late night cravingsexcellent shrimp and grits for breakfast a nice spicy barbecue taste to it my husband had the boudin omelette and it was good but the boudin wasnt crisp and was  and he thinks that wouldve been better but the hashbrowns were phenomenalgreat place for big groups friendly service i asked for what they recommended and they were 100  on point you can pretty much customize anything you order bathroom smells amazing lolwe really enjoyed out dinner here my husband and i took our tween son for dinner his only experience with greek food was my moussaka in order to expand his horizons a bit we shared the sampler app and tour of greece entree  everything was seasoned perfectly and delicious the waiter was prompt and courteous while avoiding bothering us every few minutes  some of the portions are pricey for their size on the app but were plated nicely we will be going back  one note i noticed worry on other diners faces when they spotted a child across the room my son is used to people being surprised by his dining etiquette but i would not bring an ill mannered or unpredictable child alongi go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city the food is fresh and theres a big variety they offer good coffee sandwiches breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more super convenient and the staff is always very pleasant with a good sense of humor they even offer a sandwich happy hour during the week there is seating available as wellwe stayed in st louis an extra day to check out downtown st charles and finish with lunch at hendricks this may be the best bbq weve ever had the ribs brisket pulled pork greens macncheese were amazingover the weekend my fianc and i joined our friends for a fantastic meal here the owners and staff were extremely friendly and provided excellent service we tried quite a few rolls and i definitely recommend the japican and blossom really delicious the nigiri and quail egg shooters were great and fresh too well have to try the coconut ice cream when we come back since they were out but the green tea flavor was a perfect way to conclude the sushi feast we had   we will definitely be back so glad this location opened up so close saving us the drive down to carson cityso glad i finally listened to my boyfriend this place hands down has the most delicious and amazing shrimp po boy ive had in the entire state of florida  definitely recommend you will not be disappointedloved it the staff is incredibly genuine and sweet i fell outside the restaurant and was greeted with an entire first aid kit and staff constantly checking up on me food was amazing id suggest the tenderlointhis place is amazing everything is sooo good and i have defiantly been here enough to say i have tried almost everything on the menu all the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control i have never been in a place that is so busy and still get customers served in a timely fashion some of these reviews say this place is in a bad area are yall serious its right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officeri think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time lets just start with the donuts they r amazing they have the best donuts around i love donuts so i have been to just about every donut shop in the nola area and these r the best  the donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want all u have to do is ask whenever i want special orders i call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon the apple fritters here are so good as well  red velvet cake and reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the oreo donut is just as good  next lets move on to kastleburgers these kastleburgers are a new orleans original and no one can top them these people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science  or so it appears i have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastees kastleburgers are so much better does anyone even go to crystal  also just like the donuts you can special order the kastleburgers they are always made  fresh the breakfast is so good as well they use real products it is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast u can order anything u can imagine for breakfast i have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and i have seen all different types of breakfast platters served they also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 247 now the hot plates they serve here are so good they have everything and its all home cooked u can taste it it reminds me of when i was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice they also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it  the gumbo is good as well all i can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full new orleans style donut experience this is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when i was a child its so nice to have a restaurant donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product this place is the best donut shop aroundwe stopped at mr wizards tonight for the first time  we both wanted something cold and sweet but didnt want to risk standing in line at ted drewes  we were also just a few minutes away  it was everything we hoped it would be  quiet and no lines with excellent concretes  we had a chocolate chip cookie dough and a reeses peanut butter cup in chocolate concrete mix  yummy  cheap too  we will definitely be backgreat food and atmosphere cobb salad is awesome would definitely recommend this establishmentgreat food  texture of everything is meltinyourmouth  the sauces are amazing  keep up the good workthis is hands down my favorite coffee spot i dont understand why the starbucks on broad ripple ave gets so much business because monon blows them out of the water delicious drinks a wide variety of coffees and tasty pastries make this a must see if youre in the neighborhood the honor bar is great for those times you just want some coffee and need to get in and out in a hurrythe most friendly mom and pop coffee house ever  the coffee is perfect and strong the pastries are yummy and moist worth the drive for methe pancake pantry is a great place expect to wait in line for 5  1 hour but its worth it also if one is unable to stand for this amount of time bring something with you if you havent tried the pancake pantry these pancakes need to be in or around your mouth as soon as possible i recommend trying the hashbrowns  with your mealforeword my experience with the bottleworks is as an event venue  every year when the wustl department im in is trying to recruit new graduate students we hold a social event here for the prospective and current students to mingle and get to know each other better  the two years ive taken part in this event have just been a blast  the schlafly event room in the back i forget the name of it but i think it has one is just a fun and unique place to have a private event  the view of the bottleworks is impressive and the huge private bar set up on the side is just great  i think the cost is pretty reasonable for us too which includes unlimited beerwine per head along with a bunch of delicious hors doeuvre  im a member of the group that helps put the event on this year and i definitely think were sticking with the bottleworks again  look forward to an updated review around february or march next yearthis was by far my favorite cuban sandwich of all the cubans ive had to date we were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert over all the experience was excellent  i cant wait to go there againbeen going to this place since i was a small child always loved the soft serve ginormous vanilla cone the italian ice was good here as well but not sure if they still serve that these days i highly recommend if youre in the area and need some relief from the fl heat i love this little cafe currently my favorite dish is the garam masala bowl but the veggie burger is pretty awesome i love that theyre dedicated to organic local and sustainably raised food and the renovated former laundromat is pretty cool too  ive also been here for the indian food they do on friday and saturday evenings its called thalia and they do an allyoucaneat style its really awesome and i highly recommend ithad dinner at baileys range last night 102711  my wife and i had the abc burger and the lamb burger and shared halvesthis was a flavor explosionary experience everything about both burgers was awesome the meat was delish the buns perfect toppings perfect  the beer selection is all st louis area beer except no abinbev products which isnt st louis area beer anymore is it the pickle was like the best pickle ive ever had and the ketchup was great too  they actually make the pickles and ketchup themselves  fries were quite good kindof a britishstyle chip you  know a little translucent  for soda lovers they have an amazing array of non cornsyrup selections ie cane sugar    rest assured i will be back for the wedge salad and the bison burger on another dayill keep it short and sweet oh my god im hilarious  imaginative concoctions friendly staff unlimited samples cant rave enough about the place  i know youre trying to pick a good praline place while youre in town this is iti really do enjoy this food you can tell it is made with care and consideration overall deliciousawesome burgers i went adventurous and tried the wiki wiki which is wild boar with duck bacon my wife had the buckaroo which was a beef patty topped with brisket both were very tasty a little on the smaller side but great flavors make up for it in spades fries and rings were great tooi had three dogs here because they are that good i had the daves style the western and the pizza dog the pizza dog is amazing i highly recommend daves dogthis vietnamese restaurant was our last stop before heading home  we picked up a few sandwiches banh mi for 350 each  by the way its buy 5 get 1 free  to our pleasant surprise this place also serves some popular dishes such as bun bo hue spicy noodle soup pho beef stew bo kho etc  we ordered these dishes and they were authentic vietnamese   the place was spic and span including the bathroom  since we were there around 11am and probably were their first customers of the day we dont know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day  as for banh mi we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches as they were not going to be consumed right away  the folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when were ready to eat  nice touch  the meats for the sandwiches at seasons cafe and bakery were in good quantity which puts the banh mi shops in northern va to shame  the workers wore gloves when handling foods and their sanitation practices seem to be better than most typical vietnamese restaurants weve visited wish this restaurant was near us at home in northern vatodays 1st time visit to ippolitos was fantastic i love the fresh selection of seafood i had the tuna cheesesteak and i very much enjoyed it but felt remorse for i had just finished coming from the gym but the sesame roll was undeniable josiah is awesome and we talked seafood for we were both fanatics and he hooked me up with a fresh complementary piece of fish which i promptly seasoned and baked as soon as i got home good job folksfood is excellent and fresh everytime i go there the staff is friendly and the food is just so flavorful i have brought several people here for the first time and they all love ittoday was our first visit its a cool little place in a nice neighborhood thankfully they have their own parking lot but theres plenty of street parking too which is good because it was packed the inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating not that it mattered because it was so crowded but i cant fault them for that  the customer service was really good although the guy who took our order didnt seem to believe that i knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if i had ever had one before i badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what i wanted im just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about  that being said when i got it it was great obviously good quality espresso my husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasnt a fan of but i really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder he also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat and he loved that their to go cups are also really cute its out of the way but well definitely be backthis place has great donuts and sliders kids wanted to come back the second day wish we could take some home but the fill up before we go will have to sufficei didnt even hesitate before giving this place 5 stars  new orleans is my husband and my favorite vacation city and we miss the food so much when we come home  someone suggested we try this place and its quickly becoming a favorite  heres what weve tried so far jambalaya awesome  great heat rice consistancy was perfect a peeve of mine  exactly how i like it  unfortunately the hubby isnt into jambalaya so we dont order it often   red beans and rice traditional  delicious brisket gumbo so tender smokey ridiculously good   muffaletta this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of nola  many places do their own variation but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish  i had heard that serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and i had to try it  spot on  love it love it cafe au lait mmmmm beignets this is the only thing id pass on  very good but made with cinnamon with isnt my thing  i always get take out and he packs everything for easy microwaving or reheatinghad brunch on a saturday food was delicious service was great great atmosphere will definitely put this place in my rotation of favorite spotsthis place is pretty amazing with a novel idea the pizza is great the choices are vast   only suggestion clean the walls they are covered in dust and lint look uptasting for our wedding cakes tasted 3 gluten free flavors  chocolate vanilla pina colada and 5 regular flavors was a nice tasting experience ill post another review after we have the wedding and get the cakelet me start out by saying that i am a nut for good sushi out of probably 200 sushi bars i have been to there are only 9 places in the world that i have been to that meet my criteria to be called a good sushi bar three are in japan 2 are in los angeles 1 is in san francisco 2 are in new york and then theres this place in shtty old philadelphia a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in center city izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way any good food starts out with good ingredients making good traditional sushi is very simple use good quality rice prepared properly excellent fish and a dab of some good homemade wasabi most places suck at all or some of these things not this place small restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the frontofhouse hardest working people in the restaurant industry those foh guys probably only 3035 seats but when the place is full they are running around like crazy serving food taking orders busing tables and seating new parties the wait can be long but it is worth it all of the fish i have had there virtually every fish on the menu has been perfect as sashimi and sushi and their maki rolls are good as well special shoutouts for the tuna salmon superwhite tuna dont eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues and the oh toro all are excellent in texture quality taste and preparation if you like spicy tuna rolls you wont eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon theres no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day   the good food doesnt stop at the sushi though their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of ohmygoodness this is amazing  we first visited izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago and now find ourselves there once a week its that goodthis place is insane amazing selection of anything you could possibly want fresh coffee bar gelato pastries cheeses wines sliced meats fresh homemade pastas  sauces i could go on for a while you need to go herei have been going to the pantry for years and i have it down to a science for one thing here are the ground rules it is a hang over cure for the vanderbilt and belmont university set so weekends after 9am will be a bear to get in the line can stretch for hours and blocks but once you get in the service is fast and efficient   the cool factor is that i have gone in on a weekday found myself a scant table or two from vince gill or kevin costner quietly enjoying breakfast without much fanfare   now the pancakes are obviously the thing to go with on the menu i usually get a half order because i have a small appetite my favorites are the sugar and spice because the syrup is something out for this world i also like the chocolate chip because they drizzle the chips on top so you mix the half melted chocolate chips with the half melted butter and then you poor a little bit of syrup on the pancakes and its nothing short of a religious experience   the coffee is just okeveryone will agree that im a highly judgmental person usually on the negative side so when i come across something that is actually amazing i think its important to make note breaux mart has amazing king cakes ive had this response from both locals and tourists alike this location will make them for you out of season if you preorder  and they have all the basic staples that a new orleanian might need during a pilgrimage between msy airport and the french quarterdowntown ie blue runner red beans hubigs pies and community coffee my normal omg i need it list im writing this review solely based on the fact that i am sitting here at 2 am on a sunday night craving sushiya mind you i graduated two years ago i just love their iv roll  miso soup so much its not your best quality sushi restaurant by any means but it is damn goodthis is the best vietnamese restaurant in town ive seen them saigon transition from a grocery store to restaurant their food is always amazing and you can never go wrong the service can be sometimes feisty but its all worth it if youre new to asian food you can never go wrong with the viet chicken pork etc grilled sandwich or the pholooking for the  best italian food and grocery this is the place to be  it could be very crowded on weekend  the full parking lot and hundreds of customers   inside the store proved that how popular this place is regardless of the big crowd the service was fast the employee were well trained and friendly  they were on the top of their game i love the prepared food area this time we got 2 mango tandoori chicken drumsticks a piece of italian stromboli  and couple piece of beef plus 2 root beer sum up around 10 we asked the food to be heated and it took less than 5 minutes we had a delicious picnic in the park afterward  this is the best italian market in my book i never got disappointed every time i came hereservice was awesome food was delicious very busy place for brunch on weekends but the wait was well worth itnothing i can say to convince anyone to go here its an institution the bread does not make it home unopened staff is great and selection amazingmy rating is based on the food  the service and decor are obviously lacking  go for lunch or late evening  the tasting menu is your best bet  ive gone three times  theyll send extras more of something you liked and youll get to sample items you wouldnt normally orderif you were in la the wait would be doubled if we were at home sfe nm the price would have been tripled bloody mary w a beer back and another one of their signature cocktails was only 12 the food was excellent creative and hardy a highlight of our trip to tucson for sureservice has been great both times ive been there i now crave the abc burger delicious save room for a boozy shake yumfood was good i had the weekly champion burger the vermont breakfast great the fries catsup and other sauces were good too beer selection was good but jessica was the best sit at the bar and have faith shell give you a great experience best service ive ever had in my lifephenomenal food excellent service and outstanding center city location make this restaurant a must visit and a top choice in a city already known for outstanding restaurants certainly one of my favoriteslove this place love my mots  my tom hehe all these guys are super funny and they know their stuffstaff is so friendly and courteous made me feel wonderful about paying so much for donutstried the revamped menu the duck is very good pub and kitchen is always a solid choicethis place just seems like the disney world of cafe shops its fanciful and unique but crowded trying to navigate the deli bar was extremely frustrating but it was not for the workers some people just do not understand the concept of pulling numbers and then stepping out of the way to be polite however the workers behind the counter were poised and courteous despite the onslaught the great staff stood out in other areas as well in the wine room and the cheese room i was helped by two men who were eager to answer questions hold a conversation about their respective areas and make me feel great even though i had little knowledge i never felt rushed and i felt welltaken care of even though i was young and i definitely dont look rich  great place when i am back in town i will definitely keep going for the section of foods and service   deli food 45 great for how inexpensive and mass made it is nothing really made me excited but it all tasted good  gelato 45 small varieties but very tasty  cheese 55  theres so much cheese and the guy behind the counter really knows his stuff and will help you understand the differences between all those stinky rinds wine 55 good selection and multiple staff members seemed to know what they were talking about including the location and story of many wineries  market 55 tons of imported items and variety   bottom line its crowded but worth it probably best to skip lunch time on the weekends if you dont like crowds very helpful staff will be a repeat customer2 for a drip coffee i had the corsica blend which is delicious 50 refills which is a nice deal if you plan on staying a bit to read or work my first time here and ill definitely be back great prices in rittenhouse for a good cup of joe staff was friendly line moved very fast highly recommendedthis was so worth it  first what an awesome innovation  the miniscoop sampler  i can never decide what to get and this time i got to choose four flavors  i got the chocolate lavendar honey coffee butter pecan and the pumpkin cheesecake  the butter pecan was in a league of its own but closely followed by the honey  not only were these flavorful but all four were perfectly dense creaminess  its a good thing i dont leave near the placethis is simply the best asian food available in reno periodbest traditional chinese dish flavors  but if you dont like oily pan fried food tell them put less oil or much less oil  the reception lady remember my wife when we went back to order after almost a year we lived in daly city and we go there and eat there in reno at least once  theyre goodtake my word for it  if not well nothing i can do so there this is our  my husband and i favorite casual dining place the food is consistently good nothing fancy just fresh homemade food the friday fish fry is amazing better than any i have ever tasted there are several fish choices several chicken and beef choices as well if you are trying to cut back on calories there are delicious salads and soups the prices are very reasonable and the wait people and other workers are pleasant and efficient try it youll like itdecided to give this place a try on my lunch break and i have to sayim impressed its a little small but the decorations are pleasant l most importantly the sushi is very goodand you get a good amount   i will definitely be going backfor context ive previously always been somewhat to my embarrassment generally more fond of fancytrendy donuts dorite in chicago sidecar in la etc than your momandpop style donut always thought the highquality ingredients and inspired flavor combinations made the calories more worth it   st louis is an anomaly the hipster donut offerings here are a wretched disappointment sorry strange your toppings are decent but the donuts themselves are weirdly dry and thick sorry vincent van doughnutactually im not sorry  you should be sorry for selling me that chocolatecoffee abomination thats the first donut i ever left unfinished its literally sprinkled with coffee grounds it would take some insanely good chocolate to carry that but instead you thinly coated the donut with some mediocre dark chocolate  thankfully the anomaly works both ways this homestyle shop has some truly excellent stuff for insanely low prices chocolate icing has much more depth of flavor than your average cheapdonutchocolate blueberry cakes are light fresh and fruity  perfectly sweet buttermilks are rich and satisfying all worth coming back for but oh the apple fritters deep fried perfection  if there exists an apple fritter better than the ones here i will most definitely live off the things for the rest of my likely very short liferight around the corner from our house  this is our my husband and i go to for everything brunch a cocktail a late night snack a date night   we love pub and kitchen so much  such a cool vibe and such great people the food is the best too   love itthe gentleman in the truck was very nice so he accepted making a fish quesadilla for me although its not on the menu it was the best quesadilla i had till this moment to be honestnever had a bad experience i always get a dirty chia or a lavender latte have yet to be disappointed on my drink when it comes to food i love having so many pastry options i love trying different things their croissants are buttery and delish i always look forward to going hereexcellent food and great people im a fan it is my new goto lunch spot now thanks guys keep being awesomei have eaten here twice now both meals were incredible great service and ambiance this has the feel of a restaurant in nyc if you are in downtown clw try this place outli love icesmile they are really new to the tampa area and they already have a huge following for around the same price as frozen yogurt you get to try thai style rolled ice cream this store is so trendy it feels like it should be in new york city they have a ton of different flavor and topping options they also offer discounts quite often the only suggestion i have is that they add more seating insidei just received my doberge cake in the mail and must say it is the highlight of this birthday month i grew up in new orleans but now live in california there is no better cake on the planet it was a bit of a splurge to have one shipped to me but so worth it wow the memories it brought back it arrived in perfect condition and right on time theyve improved the shipping on these cakes i ordered one a few years ago and the frosting peeled off when i peeled off the plastic wrapping not any more it was just perfect this time  my other favorite splurge is getting the amazing king cakes at mardi gras time theyre the best i bring them to work and everyone flips out over them my daughters in college expect them now too they get the king cakes beads etc and have gotten lots of attention in the dorms because of them one daughter said that people will say they will just have a little sliver then they always come back for more the baby in the king cake is always a fun topic for californians to learn about   thanks for helping me to relive my childhood memoriesi was seeking out phyllodelphia food truck and discovered this phenomenal place i am an average beer drinker but was with a friend with an exceptional beer iqand it passed her high standards the staff was informative and knowledgeable without being stuffy or snobby the fabulous mindy helped us discover what we both liked best we sampled some beers and know what we will have next time and there definitely will be many more times worth seeking out  findingbest breakfast in idaho the most delicious breakfast burrito or breakfast sandwich but also the more traditional breakfasts like eggs benedict are fantastic elegant presentation and everything is made from scratch the charming old building is a fully renovated church cathedral the coffee bar is spot on too you would think its a dedicated coffee shopgreat place for dinner had to wait bc it was the weekend but food was good  gator tail was delish walking distance from our hotel was great bc there wasnt any parking when we were there it was super busyamazing folks here and selection great customer service and help from 1000 miles away ruby was great i was missing a very important family birthday in new orleans and needed a bottle of champagne sent to the room the hotel didnt offer that and after lot of searching i stumbled upon vieux carre and they were able to delivery the bottle of champagne i wanted at a great price and actual champagne flutes for me  i will def use them againso glad to find this place the food is simply delicious apple salad is the bomb honestly i tried almost everything on the menu and was not disappointed once except for the one time when i tried to order lunch and they could not place my order because they were extremely busy which is not a bad thing  the food is just this goodthis is an awesome addition to the dessert options in nashville i love ice cream in a cone but this absolutely knocks that out of the park pun intended being next to centennial park  service the person working was a sweet older lady that was very patient and even let us try several flavors which was nice   food i had the monster blue dough with mms and peanut butter chips and the red velvet in a french vanilla cone with caramel talk about treating yourselfso rich delicious and heavy if im honest next time i will have to split two scoops in a cone as the portions are outrageously large not a bad thing  overall this place is a huge treat for your significant other or your kids i highly recommend trying nobaked at least oncegood coffee super cute location and some of the best service anywhere i havent eaten there yet but im sure i will be back to try the food in the next few days the barista kayla i dont know if the spelling is correct was super friendly and she took a bunch of time to recommend other places in the arealove this place  started being a fan in la over 25 years ago food is still great and the prices still reasonable  wish they would open another location in santa barbara i can feel a doubledouble calling me nowthis is the best vietnamese food in reno the owners used to own and run sk noodles up in sparks and it was the best before they sold that location the noodle dish with pork egg rolls and shrimp is always a must  everything else i have tried has always been greatthe best cuban ever  and cofecito a bonussooo good i love this place literally all the flavors are good but the bees knees is amazing its lavender and honey i strongly suggest that you should go theredown the street from our airbnb in treme i only ran in for coffee but they had a great patio that i would have loved to hand out on for a bit if i had timesuch great food the chef was creative and innovative while still staying true to traditional hispaniclatino cuisines the yuca fries were crispy and delicious the empanadas were great and the skirt steak w polenta was seriously the best thing ive eaten in a while my sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices the mushroom empanadas were her favorite   the service was really greatthe waiter was really helpful in helping us pick out beerscocktails try the sangria great restaurantgreat place friendly staff and great working hours snow rain or any kind of weather stories opened on time i love their egg and croissant sandwich and of course it is dunkin brands  place is kept well and sometime they treat their customer well by giving free donuts and munchkinsi love this place a group of friends and i were looking for a late night place to grab something sweet and some locals recommended this place after a trolley ride and wandering around we finally made it the environment is really comfortable with pictures of patrons on the bright walls what makes this place special is the homemade and unique ice creams if you cant decide they will let you sample a bunch of flavors you can even get half scoops i came back several times during my stay in nola  heres the flavors i got lavender honey my fav red velvet chocolate amaretto cheesecake almond toffee  highly recommendedive tried everything in the menu and i must say everything  is so good  short rib tacos omg delicious  truly my favmy first time to la fusion on my way to the mall decided to grab a bite first great food great service very beautiful restaurant setup very clean this restaurant has the atmosphere that is a relaxing place to catch up with friends and enjoy a great meal    im very picky about where i go i love good food good service and cleanliness i gave la fusion a five star rating because i feel that this restaurant deserves it i would definitely return with friendsmy god is this place ever wonderful such a huge selection delicious teas the sales people are also very friendly and it seems they really enjoy their job they will literally let you smell absolutely every tea my favourites are chocolate rocket swampwater tropicalia and goji pop you can buy tins of loose tea and these will generally last you a long while they also carry wonderful tea accessories teacups teapots mesh balls natural sweeteners infusers the works definitely try davidstea you wont regret iteverything about this place is awesome  we decided to go for sunday brunch and could not have been more pleased we were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes   i had the french toast which was outstanding and my sister ordered the grilled cheese which was one of the best shes ever had   the place was hopping the staff was friendly and theyre very fast and efficient overall amazing place to have breakfast in tucsonthe best tacos in tampa authentic  my wife and i ate here when we first moved to tampa in dec 2016 for the life of us we could not remember the name or location  we found iti am only giving 5 stars because the shamrock shake is back and delicious too bad its around only once a year my husband  i went to use a groupon that i bought for him for fathers day  it was a great time the groupon had expired but they let us use the amount paid for the groupon as a credit towards anything at the bar we each had a flight and the beer was goodon 35 big snow day in nashville a couple of friends and i went to local taco in sylvan park for dinner  when we arrived the place was jam packed and we knew there would be quite the wait  i live right by local taco and frequent the place  food is always delicious along with the margaritas  the shrimp taco is my favorite along with the local bbq try it out   my friend got her food on a separate ticket and awhile went by and i still had not received mine  it took a little longer than usual but i figured it was because they were so slammed  a few minutes later the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table  she asked if i had gotten my food yet and i said no and she apologized and said shed be right back  then bryan haas im guessing he was the manager at the time came out with our food apologizing  long story short  i received awesome customer service from the local taco staff and bryan haas especially  they compd our food for the delay and gave a gift card to return as well    i told him the gift card wasnt necessary but he insisted bryan also slipped his business card in there which i thought was very professional and sincere    i just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the allstar staff that works there  going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love local taco so much   thanks  and see yall sooni went here on a very busy day and everything moved very quickly the ingredients are fresh delicious and beautiful you have your option to creat your own bowl chipotle style or order one of their suggested combinations they top it off with a cute little flower at the end  i loved this place and will definitely be coming backthe variety of ice cream flavors offered here is ridiculous and no matter which flavor you end up going with you will not be disappointed great place for an afternoon strollclaire does an amazing job thanks so much for an enjoyable time with family excellent drinks and incredible foodall you can eat lobsters 5400 a steal of a deal i had 10 540 a lobster  cooked to perfectionhuge mall didnt get to see it all but what i did see was awesome people were really nice i will definitely visit againnothing tastes as good as skinny feelsexcept for huddles    this place is great  cheapno  deliciousyes  i dont eat ice cream or frozen yogurt on a daily basis so im okay with the splurge    i love all the different flavors of fro yo that they have  every time i go there is something different and i can always find something that i want  i wish i could remember all the flavors ive had but its like every time i take a spoonful i black out from the heavenly taste of it    i like the fact that they tell you which ones are low fat and which ones are fat free  its definitely hard to resist not getting a mass quantity since the cups are so big but im getting better at the portion control  its just so easy    the punch cards are awesome and i love that they let the 3 of us who always go together always punch the same card all at a once  some places make you have a card per person and i hate that    im already a colts fan but i like to think that every trip to huddles is just another way to show my love to the teamoh my goodness the cannoli  just amazing  simply amazing  theres not much more to say than thatall the crepes ive tried are fantastic the coffee is very good though i wish they had larger sizes available looks tiny from the outside there is comfortable seating in the basementthis amazing korean take out only establishment is  in the hmart plaza located  cheltenham old york road it is right next to where hmart  begins across from paris baguettethey have an incredible selection of delicious hot and cold prepared foodsoutstanding choices to die for are the spicy chicken piecesbreast wsweet  sour sauce wingsrival cafe soho but cheaper and the spicy blue  crab soupeverything i have tried here has been nothing short of fresh and delicious other items you cant go wrong with are the soft tofu seafood soup japchaealthough i prefer the hmart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same pricethe fried squidgimbap box lunches mak kimchiand savory pancakes  their prices are incredibly reasonable with most things 56 the box lunches are 6 and i had an amazing one last week consisting of beef bulgogi rice kimchi japchae 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that i had no idea what it was cept it was incredible i think it was some type of deepfried flourtype ball of goodnessim still dreaming of that lunch not all items are always available there sometimes is a bit of a language barrier however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can  i always check in on this place when i shop  hmart to see if they have the spicy blue crab soup today i lucked out and they had some there was a woman who was buying like 10 qts of the stuff turns out she is taking back home to wisconsin to freeze it you know its special when folks come from out of state to buy it  some of their foods are pretty spicy for occidental palates but isnt that what korean food is supposed to be i love this placenot a vegan or a vegetarian but i love eating vegan food i was so excited to try this place out it is connected to v street which is right next door so im guessing this is the vegan paradise of philly two awesome restaurants right next to each other so what does that mean well if youre like me that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome takeout you just order from both places so you dont miss out we ordered takeout from v street then headed next door to wiz kid where i ordered the wk philly the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak we were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at wiz kid and eat our food there the wk philly was ready under 10 minutes and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies i loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options i went with the spicy and my mom had the regular we split the hoagie and were both blown away by the flavor this was the best cheese steak ive ever had the bun was so tasty the meat tasted like real meat but better because i didnt feel disgusting and overly full after i ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum the cheese was so flavorful too i honestly cant say enough about how good this sandwich was the service was great too i would come back here in a heart beati can honestly say beat place i can get a good cheesesteak and the bar next to it is a bonus could work on better staff and a better way of ordering but the please is the bomb food is beyond amazingthis place is always awesome their fried chicken is great and so is their fried fish its hard to decide what to get when you go but do yourself a favor and get the buffalo chicken sandwich on a bun at least once you could eat there if you wanted to but its really more of a to go type of place dont get intimidated if there is a lot people there when you go they put out food fast and accuratehighly recommend this tour we had a great experience and didnt have to spend a boat load of money to have a good time the tour guides were informational and we really enjoyed the beer samples along the way probably a little too much if youre just arriving in st louis and are looking for fun and inexpensive experiences this is the place to goamazing beer and all for an amazing price they have a great food truck outside  wonderful seating place under the trees the brewtenders are great the severe told a funny story about the dickin cider customer this bar reminds of us of our home brewery out of co and nm awesome place come and enjoymy husband and i love pure black from la colombe the best stuff on earth after we had a problem with our online order we contacted them and they refunded our money and sent us free coffee great service we will be customers for lifebevan did an absolutely amazing job on the independence mall tour he knew so much history and made it really interesting to listen to if school had been like that i probably wouldnt have had my cousin do my homework  it was a long tour 2 hours but wasnt overwhelming or long winded we learned so much and really enjoyed our time in phillyomgpassing through the mall the girl offered me a sample  it was moist sweet with a hint of coffee  that little teaser was enough for me to try it  i bought the original and the almond  needless to say the original didnt have a chance to come home with me i ate it on my 7 mile drive home i cant wait till the morning to have my other bun for breakfast with my coffeei can not wait   it wasnt greasy it was fluffy airy and delishwe probably got nearly 90 number 1s for 185 a lot more than the place in del city for the money ill never go anywhere else my friends in ny go nuts over these live bluesvisiting philadelphia from chicago and came into this store to purchase souvenirs for family we found more than we even expected we purchase so many items because the prices were great we found souvenirs and even more the owner was amazing and helped us pick out some of our gifts to take back home we spent and hour there shopping and talking with the owner and didnt want to leave thank you for such a great experience in south philly nicole and michellethe guy was super nice and attentive and told me what would go good on my white sauce pizza i listened to him and my pizza was great i went with friends and we all got something different and all taste tested each others food and all of it was tasty definitely will be going back we also got the free pesto breadsticks yum their marinara is deliciouslove imperial best snoballs around anna and maddie are the best employees also we stan franksuch a great spot authentic amazing food with many options and super friendly staff food tastes fresh and comes with really good portions wish these were all over americabest wings in indy get the signature sauce both locations have great atmosphere with awesome wait staffflawless you will never find a restaurant like this   the food which changes seasonally is always perfect it is an experience by itself i ordered a ribeye and it was the best cut of meat ive ever had in my life cooked perfectly seasoned and oddly breaded which sounds unappealing until you taste it not only was it one of the best steaks ive ever had it was one of the best meals ive ever had   the fact that chef baldino spends his time walking around shaking hands with people before they leave and having real genuine conversations adds to the already glowing ambiance and the staff is wellversed and warm  if youre willing to splurge on a dinner make sure you go here it is an experiencewent to get started and drew provided all the info i needed and more  big selection everything you need easy 5 starwhen the boss is away the kids will take a little bit longer lunch hour and venture to broad ripple to eat somewhere theyve wanted to try for a long time  i cant believe i didnt make it here sooner  i dont know which i liked better the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich  he was super friendly making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didnt have to deport anyone for not liking his food which i dont think is possible  the sandwich was bigger than i expected and loaded  there was more ham on it than i normally eat at christmas dinner yet at the end i was somehow wanting more  the black bean soup was the perfect side dish  pro tip check out coupons4indycom before you go  cant wait til next timedo yourself a favor and order up a beef gyro platter it comes with so much food you could probably feed two but youre going to want to hoard it all for yourself plus you get enough hummus and pita to bath in  win winawesome little mom  pop cafe warm atmosphere cheerful staff they had someone playing the piano too looked like a lot of locals here most were welcomed with a hug as we were given one when we left food was fabulous i had the chicken salad which was recommended and it did not disappoint prices were very reasonable if we came back into town i would definitely stop back here acashiers are fast  efficient coffee always fresh and hot i like that they have a large variety of coffees employees are  friendly the store is always cleancraving sushi tonight but wanted to get away from the norm i remembered kei sushi and headed over to that part of town  we walked in to a nice pleasant atmosphere and were seated quickly the ambience and decor are great and its not overly loud  our sushi chef isiah made some nice suggestions right off the bat a they were delicious the nigiri was very fresh and full of flavor  my favorites of the night were the ceviche appetizer the pink lady and the albacore  will put on the top of my list for sushiwent here today with my family and i must say its not too often you get good chipotle at least not for me the service was great they were all super friendly and didnt give attitude when we asked for more of something which is always a plus haha the inside is really nice absolutely love the ambiance i got my regular the veggie bowl and it was really goodfirst time my girlfriend and i came here and it was delicious the french toast was just right the thing that did for me though was the hash browns absolutely amazing waiter was kind and was nice enough to check up on my girlfriend and i to see how were doing great experiencei have to give this little hole in the wall in the perfect location a woohoo   there is a limited amount of seating and the restaurant is the very end of the santa barbara pier it is in walking distance of many of the hotels close to the water in sb    the shellfish company is a good name for this restaurant as there is all kind of yummy seafood  i opted for the maine lobster tacos that had fresh avocado a spicy mayo dip on the side lettuce tomatoes served on 2double tortillas with rice  the wine menu is generic but i had a nice glass of santa barbara wine company chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic white zin  they do not have espresso or dessert but that was no big deal as the experience was perfect  good window views and seats at the bar it is small and i would anticipate on the weekends the place is near impossible to get into  check it out next time your in santa barbara it is quite the experiencewonderful vineyard great selection of red and white wines as well as ports karen was a great server today they had live jazz it was a nice way to spend the afternoonfirst things first   the donuts are amazing  fresh inventive and true to their name i tried the wedding cake cinnamon sugar and nola cream not on the same day i swear  the nola cream has a slight hint of rum and reminded me of a bushwacker for those of you familiar with the heavenly frozenchocolateyrumconcoction served near the gulf coast   service was nice  fast atmosphere was great now to address the comments about these donuts being a strange consistency  the donuts here in my opinion have an almost beignet texture and flavor being from the area i loved it and found nothing really odd about it  again they are deliciousdined there a bit ago and can only remember truly delicious things about this restaurant everything that i tried and ordered was beyond my expectations and blew me away  byob perfect atmosphere and the chef konstantinos came out and introduced himself very personable man  overall id definitely recommend this restaurant for making you feel at home in a greekcypriot house when you are eatingbest ice cream in new orleans  i personally love the chocolate peanut butter and fudgebest donut shop in stl family owned clean truly great service by people that care and know you the donuts are amazing handmade every morning its packed every day great breakfast sandwiches toofor authentic fresh and flavorful mexican food you have to go to las cazuelas the enchiladas mole and mole enchiladas are fantastic the horchata and mexican coffee are excellent drinks it gets major points for being byob the meats are so tender and the rice is perfectly cooked the main reason for the perfect five stars is what topped the whole experience for me the dessert the best dessert ive ever eaten ever you must order the cheesecake bunuelos it will blow your mind i will forever be returning to las cazuelasgreat selection of board games past and present the food is good and the coffee is greative been here 5 times and ordered the chicken veracruz salad i love it almost obsessed with it lol the cashierserver has always been nice and helpful ill keep going backthe hype is worth the wait i had never tried falafels prior to my visit to the the falafel nazi falafel king i know this is not pc and no offense is intended but it is an appropriate title to give him it doesnt just communicate how great the food is but the experience youll have   the standard center city lunch crowd knows this unmarked cart on 20th and it usually has a long line in front of it prepare for passerbys to make comments on how youre waiting in line inquiring as to what it is for and pretty much just staring at you tip show up just before 1200pm to limit the waiting we got there at 1145 and still had to wait 40 minutes   there is no menu get used not to making choices the cart is run by one man and he is eccentric but entertaining he clearly has a passion for his food youll receive what he serves but expect hummus falafel and chicken he changes it up based on his shopping that week and i had had a mix of watercress apples melons with mine the sauce was spicy and divine   its worth the wait  remember cash onlymy daughter and i go here often best froyo in reno creamier and better tasting yogurt than other froyo places in town reasonably prices you choose how much or how little yogurt and toppings to take paid for by weight so be careful this location is right next to bertha mirandas in the same building at the corner of longley and s virginiajust another delightful stop during my new orleans visit loved the look of it when we first walked in as it resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor next the plethora of unique flavors the hardest part was deciding on which flavors to choose the mini scoop samplers are the way to go that way you can try a variety i got a sampler and i cannot say there was one flavor i did not like this place is a must stop oh and the staff was super friendly too even with a line out the door cash onlyok i have to confess jimboys tacos are about as greesy as it gets probably as bad for you as it gets but they are my guilty pleasure  i love them  its true love  i cant help it  its a relationship that started back in high school when i used to get braindeadstoned after school and then go to jimboys to eat all the tacos i could stuff down my throat there is something about the greesy meat and cheese with the shell thats covered in parmasean cheese its soooo incredible  its my white castle  i no longer indulge in the ganja substance abuse beforehand but the tacos are almost as good without itevery time i go visit my sister in law and family we stop by early early saturday to get these donuts  yummy  the bestthis place has a northern california vibe reminds me of breweries in napa very open large space and a good selection of craft beer the other side is a winery which is neat as well   i recommend trying their flight of beers to get a taste of everythingwow probably some of the best cupcakes ive had since i moved to tampa   i stopped by when these guys came to flicks and food trucks and had heard their desserts were awesome being someone that loves desserts i had to give them a try looking at the menu i noticed they had some more unusual flavors chai tea and honey hmmm sounds interesting  so i got the chai tea and honey cupcake with cream cheese frosting and since i initially couldnt decide between that flavor and the chocolate caramel i obviously got both   the chai tea cupcake was amazing perfect spice cake flavor and the cream cheese frosting was rich and perfectly creamy   the chocolate caramel cupcake was good as well the cake itself was moist and chocolatey and the buttercream icing was light smooth and not too sweet  and yes i had both of them in the same sitting too tempted not to  im going to be following these guys closely for sure they had a lot of other different cupcakes too and if theyre all as good as the ones i had ill be super pleasedwhats not to like raw milk kefir yogurt plus farmfresh eggs and meat  a little expensive but youre paying for quality stuff not overprocessed garbage from a factory farm having grown up on a dairy farm in upstate ny i drank only raw milk i miss that milk thankfully i never outgrew shaking up the milk bottle before drinking so i dont have to readjust now that im back on the raw milk  they also have homemade rice pudding  amazing so good they also make their own ice cream im guessing theyre conservatives based on the politicallycharged names but whatevs also saw some raw honey on the shelves if they had more stuff id probably buy iti am new to homebrewing and am so thankful for this place ive been in once and they answered all my questions ive even called in when i was having trouble getting my keg tapped and they very pleasantly helped me figure out was was wrong i love philly homebrew outlet and will be purchasing from them in the futurenice experience  we had quiche and joes scramble and a lemmon muffin all excellent  the bottomless mimosas were wonderful and the waitstaff kept them coming  such a great start to saturday  the remodel was well worth the wait the place looks fantastici cannot day enough good things about this place i have been to various markets all around the world and mazzaros falls in my top 3 the prices are ridiculously inexpensive and everything tastes amazing its hard to rope yourself in from not buying everything the bakery cookies are fresh and different from others in the area and the meal options such as anti pasta or even the veal park taste just like your grandma made it aces and a must visit if you are visiting in towna sushi place that delivers yes please everything we ordered was great  queen roll sweet heart roll summer roll plus some individual sushi pieces fresh well prepared flavorful combinations cash only so plan accordingly well be ordering from them againlives up to the hype bring cash as no cards accepted had to run cross st for atm lavendar honey creole cream cheese coffee and christmas i loved the xmas flavor and lavendar mostabsolutely charming breakfast brunch and dinner spot happened it while in philly for a conference and actually considered extending my stay just to explore their menu fully  food is elegant but has a warm home cooked feel coffee is strong and the ambiance is great  gotta love a spot whose servers shout opa when a guest breaks a glasswhat a fun little find busy first thing in the morning our server was spunky and fun just the right amount of perfect service   my husband was starving and grumpy after our red eye flight in from cali this was the perfect meal to perk him right up   i ordered plain crepes with powdered sugar they were thick unlike an ordinary crepe which was a little weird but none the less delicious i topped them off with some cinnamoncream syrup my husband enjoyed a meaty man omelet with a side of cinnamon and sugar pancakes   the portions are just right totally worth the extra 10 min drive from the airportcharming store with incredible section of loose leaf teas and all sorts of loose leaf tea pots and accessories lovely bar to sit and enjoy as well as outdoor seating staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the tea is the best cuppa ive ever hadso kelp just keeps getting better in the the last year and a half not only did they add an adorable outside area where you are seated under globe string lights but more importantly the menu got a major upgrade   1 theres more vegetarian rolls on the menu than any other sushi place ive ever been to ever  theyre really really

fiammes since its inception but due to its limited hours and the distance to drive from so az it never happened so when we had a staycation in the foot hills we jumped at the opportunity dine  fiammes it is located in a strip mall  a long deep and narrow venue with few tables much reminiscent of hanover street in the nahth end of boston the store is immaculate and the help is uber friendly we got a simple caprese salad that was divine as was the bread served with it the 13 carne pizza was amazing  several types of meats a bit of cheese and a scant dolep of red gravy on a dough pie that literally puffed up around the outside into an airy slightly burnt crust the owner mr scott volpi was interacting with the customers as well as his staff  he is a very personable young man we wish him well as i told him on the way out my only regret is that we didnt come up from se az sooner weve been missing a lotwe are from hawaii and know good sushi first off for the price you pay for all you can eat you cannot beat it the service is awesome sushi chef if spot on and the food is onolicious hawaiian for delicious i cannot say enough about the presentation so youre just gonna have to stop by and see for yourself i give this sushi joint a ten star will be back again when we return next year enjoyhad a great lunch recently and for what is supposed to be a college hangout the food is fabulous fries to die for my spinach wrap on my grilled cod was so fresh i swear they just made it had a very fresh salad as a side and the homemade ranch dressing was thick and creamy sabrina our waitress was great too will go back and try something elsei had the smokehouse double and a oreo cookie shake with peanut butter mixed in and it was fantasticlynden was out waitress with lots of energy and a bit spunkwe had such a great time here and you would toowe went on a sunday night and it was surprisingly unbusy and quiet but then the food came and nothing else mattered  my main was fantastic as well as everything else food  additionally our server was memorably good  he was always keeping an eye out to ensure we had everything we needed or may have wanted without being overbearing and allowing the conversation at the table to go on uninterrupted  good job chap  the ambiance was nice it was dark cozy and pretty darn romantic  i almost forgot the drinks were fantastic too  i cant remember the last time i ate at a nice restaurant where every aspect was spoton  i look forward to going again soonin a week of beer and wine tasting in southern california this place had the standout beer  their xii quad was to die for  im usually an ipa man where my wife usually goes for porters and stouts and this one hit the spot with both of us    nice bar area and friendly staff close to other wine and beer tasting rooms in the funk zone  definitely worth going the extra couple of blocks for iti did have a bad review for this restaurant but now that the manager has made contact with me and cleared up the issue i decided to change my review not only is the food amazing but the service is extremely friendly and cares about your food five stars from meive been to five other juice bars in the tampa bay area this is the only one that has my business great quality ironically the prices at other juice bars are higher this place is legitthis is the best pastry shop i have found in tucson to date my father loves the chocolate eclairs i love the almond croissants and the coffees my main complaint is how small this place is so many people go here because it is really that good  it would also be awesome if they made french macarons i am so happy this place is not that far from my home if you enjoy almond go for the croissants and bear claws yumbeen going since opening  beer is amazing great quality better taste  food trucks too  enough saidim pleased to say that i tried the elm cafe catering   the sandwiches were amazing and the bread was so fresh i loved the muffins and can finally understand what all the hype is about   i had both a blt and a vegetarian and i found the vegetarian most flavourful and packed with some delicious spice and tasty vegees  i would definitely order from them again and the table was most pleased with the order too cant speak to the coffee as i just had a wateras expected the donuts were amazing my husband loved them the options were plentiful check this place out yummyomg omg omg what a hidden gem im disappointed i didnt take pics but the food and service was amazing i forgot my servers name but she was very helpful and so attentive as i arrived earlier than the rest of my party one other person she kept checking up on me to see if i needed anything once my friend arrived the server then explained the menu to us bc it was our first time she recommended the steak tartar in a jar and we ordered two pastas the lamb and the seafood although they are small portions we were stuffed the steak tartar was my favorite i honestly dream about it it was that good served with crunchy soft bread everything was very on point at this place will def visit again soon and theres a parking lot a great plus for me bc i hate driving around looking for parkingalden and his two partners arolyn and chuggy have added a new wonderful ice cream store on the se corner of campbell  speedway here in tucson alden and wife ma are old hands at making and serving ice cream s they have been doing this for 20 some years at heir store in booth bay harbor maine they make their own ice cream and have created all the flavorsthis place is great and worth all 5stars  we wanted a big breakfast and we got it  we ordered the fried green tomato blt sweet cream pancakes and the country creole breakfast  as my 8 year old daughter said it was delightful  this is a must while in nolait is a real gem i didnt appreciate how unique it was and regret driving by it for so many years they have a great happy hour and a deschutes beer selection to be proud of  and most importantly the food is really good the subs are hearty and fresh  go for the 9 italian and then afterwards order a subreally like this placefood isnt always the star of the show but doesnt mean its not goodit really is good selection of beer wine list is simple and good but sets a great vibe that you can tell makes it everyones neighborhood joint always a fun timei absolutely love sprinkles cupcakes in my opinion the cupcakes are perfectly moist and every cupcake i have had so far has been extremely satisfying my personal favorite is german chocolate cake this location is fairly small so it looks like there is a bigger line than there actually is  oh check out there rewards program it pretty awesome it got me a free cupcake when i signed upi love craft beers i decided to make a stop and try deviate brewing this is the best local craft beer ive had since moving to indy i tried the two ipas blood orange sour belgian peach and the gingerbread stout all of them were delicious prices are reasonable staff are friendly another plus dogs are allowed i will definitely come backomg this place is the bomb a local recommended it to us he mentioned national awards for their donuts and i could see why i also had a breakfast slider with best bread  the place has a great authentic industrial rustic neighborhood feel with seating inside and out have you ever eaten food that is so good it feels like youre drunk happy as you sit and enjoy it this is that kind of placethe old saying is true you get what you pay for not a tea bag place or starbucks   ernie  manager and jennifer are very knowledgeable of teas from all over the world and how to meet strict standards  if you have to ask how much you cant afford it go get lipton tea and be happy  after traveling the world for 45 yrs you find better unless you go to that country  what is cheaper i suffered from a variety of health issues that center from caffeine consumption and usa processed foods my allergies migraines nicotine and yes less medications in just a short time  thanks to both of them i have better health weight loss and increase overall  stamina thank you teavangot the managers recommendations on a full dinner spread for a group of 7  everything was perfectly prepared and true to its greek roots tirokafteri dip was phenomenal on everything we ate over the course of the meal and the honeylemon chicken roasted on a charcoal rotisserie was outstanding  the salad was super fresh and its clear the place doesnt settle for less than high quality ingredients   highly recommend  will be back when im in nashville againdelicious fresh and friendly volunteers yesterday was my second trip to hollygrove farmers market the produce is fresh and organic the volunteers were nice and helpful their tomatoes and curly kale is delicious oh and the cucumbers were yummy big and crisply fresh i also purchased zucchini and fairytale eggplant anhich i havent tasted yetin riva never disappoints the food is delicious mamas meat balls polenta duck ragu  pepperoni pizza are some of my favorites the waitstaff is always great and the atmosphere is perfect both indoor and outdoor    last night we ordered a 4 course tasting menu and it was amazing everything their kitchen puts out is a masterpieceincredibly good on a second visit as well the chicken curry is consistent  perfectly spiced garlicy the goat biryani is phenomenalhaving been to greece and eaten at a villaturnedresto a stones throw from the sea separated by a white sand beach the gustatory resonance of that experience still informs whether i think a resto is horrible or amazing and this place is truly divine   i had a kedegree platter for brunch and the rice was seasoned full of life and the veggies and fish were both extra fresh i normally dont drink anything than water but the mint tea  lemonade lemonanna was too intriguing to pass up and boy im glad i splurged that had to be one of the finest blends of balance ive had in a drink   i had always thought that this place was exorbitantly expensive but my meal was actually very affordable for brunch dinner is still pricey i do appreciate that theres an upscale vibe on the inside however alongside a more casual one under the outdoor awninggreat little find came here for brunch  built my own bloody maryi also had their roast beef signature sandwich  good service too  i will def come back for morekanella carries a welldeserved reputation as a prime brunch spot in philly luck smiled on my party of three as we snagged a lastminute reservation at noon you should plan further in advance than we did i echo other reviewers sentiments concerning the decor at kanella as i walked in the antique exposed brick and bluewhite color scheme tempoarily transported me back to the cycladic islands chef pitsillides kept the illusion going with his typically mediterranean hospitality he checked on our table thrice to make sure we felt welcomed and indeed the constant attention and care we received has earned kanella a return visit on that merit alone  that isnt to downplay his cypriot fare the food is absolutely delicious one can only indulge in so many variations of french toast or eggs benedict before growing bored and kanellas vibrant rustic plates certainly enliven the palette and restore ones faith in brunch we commenced our meal with the obligatory dip trio which served up pumpkinfeta spicy tomato and white bean dips in lieu of the stereotypical hummus and baba each scored high marks from the table with the pumpkin cruising into first with an interesting brinyearthysweet interplay   other dishes ordered included the baked duck egg potatoes with tzatziki and a special lamb tongue stew though small in portion the duck egg showed deft execution with a crispy but eversoslightlycreamy fried egg crowning wellseasoned toothsome greens in yogurt sauce the potatoes had a similarly crisp texture with fluffy innards and paired beautifully with accompanying minty rich tzatziki the tongue stew offered a heaping plate of creamy giant beans and tender pleasantly funky lamb tongue pieces in a vibrantly flavored sauce with a squeeze of lemon juice a dollop of accompanying greek yogurt and a lastminute side order of extra grilled pita the dish served as a hearty memorable combination of flavors and textures  for a change of pace in the philly dining scene or simply for chef pitsillides welcoming demeanor and crazygood plates head to kanella and get whisked away to the aegean for an hour or soim already looking forward to going back this friday for a green smoothie i walked in and was immediately energized by the lime green everywhere we ordered the doc sandwich with hummus tomato cucumber avocado and sprouts on twelve grain bread i didnt remember seeing sprouts on the menu but no big deali just picked them off it was awesome so light and fresh and perfect for lunch on a hot day i also got the green smoothie which i loved i cant wait for my next visitthank you yelp for another good find a great choice when in town just behind busch gardens being from out of town i may have been skeptical being off the beaten path and not the best neighborhood dont let that hold you back went with my kids and glad we did the service is very friendly and professional must be the owners they take pride in their business and it shows food was delicious perfectly prepared and presentedon the way back home if traveling on route 42 instead of the ac expressway i always stop at licios if it is an early stop it might just be for some of their great bread and a piece of pizza at lunch i would  get one of my two favorites the minute man italian or the wedgewood paisano which has different italian meats in it both are delicious my wife loves their vilotti veggie with oven roasted portobello mushrooms or eggplant roasted red peppers broccoli rabe  sharp provolone i try not to load up on their tasty baked goods but trying to decide on whether to get a canolli or sfogliatelle is toughto the point  i go to this brueggers everyday as it it close from where i work and i would like to point a few things out as reference for anyone that is thinking of going for breakfast or lunch  soups saladas and sandwiches are great and fast bagels and cream cheese variety and selection are amazing specially if you go early in the morning staff is nice friendly attentive and if they ask you how are you doing theres a genuine tone to the sentence  i am writing this today because i had an incident with my card i forgot it and because i go pretty often i still got my order with a little note geovana will pay such and such tomorrow and i did because of the nice staff i didnt have to leave hungry and embarrassed    great food great staff great experiencei heard this is the original habit so i had to try it  not disappointed at all the charburger is excellent along with their fries bottomless drinks is a plus  its located in old town goleta with ample parking out back   i cant stay if i like this more than innout so i have to say i like this place just as much as innout definitely my go to burger jointquick and super friendly emily was super helpful with our order the burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp overall this was a great experienceon the banks of the river  is the best pizza i have ever eaten period  its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments  a thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay rather than delivering toppings in an afterthought unremarkable edible vessel  the perfect meal so far   vasi  ceci beans and lentis tomato scapece grana padano  antipasti  aggrodolce pork ribs green apple pistachio  le pizze  spicy ham coppa piccante san marzano tomato  dolci  zeppole blackberry yogurt lemon curd  honorable mentions and

decide what to get i was low on cash so ended up getting just 14 lb of japanese pan fired sencha tea which was around 3 or 4 great price for a good amount of goodquality tea am definitely coming backchocolate mint martini was amazing girlfriend had chocolate covered banana martini and loved it we split the standing banana split and the home made icecream is the best i have hadjosefs did our wedding cake it was absolutely incredible both the cake and the design  the custom airbrushed fondant leaves and branches to match our invitations were amazing  the fondant was perfectly thin on the outside of the cake  it was delivered precisely on time and was just amazing couldnt have been happier  i also have to say we love their breakfasts super deliciouscant get any better than real ice cream on a rainy day the seasonal coconut almond joy ice cream was amazing bearcat had all my favorite flavors butter pecan bananas chocolate fudge vanilla super sweet just my style however extremely big portions but an ice cream lovers paradisehidden gem my wife  i ate here twice on our trip to tucson great bread good breakfast food  we had to limit ourselves from gorging on all the delicious baked sweets  service was friendly and you can tell that they take pride in what they do very affordable toocame here for brunch with my family on a day trip to philly the ambience was relaxed though the service was very prompt   we began with a shared plate of dips and bread the dips were really special hummus style and change  we had beet beautiful color nice earthy taste sardine a bit fishy for my taste but the rest of my party devoured it and a third veggie one my favorite   i had the smoked cod with basmati rice and boiled egg though it isnt a traditional brunch meal it was a great meal with good flavors and the right portions   my mom went with the featured cyprus breakfast and what looked like hash browns is actually a greek styled cheese very delish i would recommend this dish for those looking for brunch fare   their almond milk drink is mmm yum very thick and sweet  great for breakfast addon   our waitress was fine but the hostowner  was really welcoming and helpful along the way to bump up my ratingthis is the first time i tried this place and i was really impressed the food was very tastyi wouldnt say authentic but still good service was great a smidge sugary sweet but its better than having some angry b as a waitress the only thing is that the restaurant is in the hood i grew up in this neighborhood and would never come here at night lol  happy diningfunky little fast food place but terrific taiwanese treasures to found three of us enjoyed the window seating and samples several menu items  worth a try and then another and anotherfive guys is my go to greasy cheat food in indianapolis   always so good  get the cajun fries but if youre watching calories youll end up tossing half of them the small is still a decent sack full   everyone at this location has been friendly efficient and accurate half a dozen orders and never an incorrect one  check out the new mobile app for orderahead they finish preparation when you arrive so so far food has still been fresh and hot though you will have to wait a few minutes as a resultbeautiful and great tasting cakes  i travel across the city to get my birthday cakes from esm  great service as well  very friendlythe beer is good they have tables to sit they have board games to play it was fun to just sit and have a few drinks my wife is pregnant and she cant drinkthe only reason she beat me in trivia pursuit they have popcorn you can buy therecheddar and cheddar and carmel mix you can earn rewards for visiting there i paid with a card and everything was easy and receipt was sent to my phone   foodyou can order from cluster truck they deliver to the parking lot 1st time ordering you get 10 off cluster truck has a ton of food options and the food is fantastic you order from an app and they accept apple pay too the reason i focus on the food is because good beer is good beer but having food too is rare they also have a stage area for small concerts i will go back oh and the bathroom has to be one of the cleanest public bathrooms ive usedjust sayinga hidden jem right off main street  its a no frills place but the food is fresh healthy and reasonably priced the smoothie my boyfriend got was so good he took another one for the road i had the falafel platter and  it was awesome i will definitely be coming backif you consider the reasonable prices the beautiful location and the need for such an establishment in this area i have to say this was a five star experience the service was smart and easy going with our two year old son she comped us an app when our drink order took an unusually long time and she ran down her list of favorites for us twice we ordered 8 things on the menu and not one was average or just satisfactory everything was delicious my favorites were the octopus app and the asparagus app so good cherries and truffles yum yum yummyi dig this place great cobb salad great flatbreads amazing bbq sandwich super solid ingredients pretty good service and a nice cafe environment not the cheapest place in the world but it has delicious food always worth itgreat vibe great food  stands out even in a town with lots of good eatsits eye candy simply  walking into this place i have picked up cookies cupcakes and small cakes no large orders from this bakery    there are always samples out and the staff is friendly    you will pay a little more here as this is a traditional bakery focused on artisancreated baked goods   you can just stop in and they have a number of cakes ready to customize for you  my only suggestion is adding glutenfree items or making them more visible they might also highlight lowercalorie items or a small section too buy hey this is a bakery this is a smallsize whole foods bigger than south street but tiny compared to cherry hill or marlton nj the staff however is always super nice best of the 3 others and they are good about special orders i love farmers markets and small local markets with great produce but this whole foods offers convenience and excellent quality fresh produce their new location is being built north and a block closer to fairmount so even closer for us yayjust the best sandwiches in tucson a good variety great menu and it is exciting to see the place is getting a makeover to make getting sandwiches faster and better a nice neighborhood place and they deliver online ordering available but i prefer to calli really enjoy the service here ive been coming here for almost my entire life and the food never ceases to amaze meafter searching for the best beignets in new orleans we finally found it at morning call   the beignets were absolute perfection  flaky poofy and beautifully golden brown  we asked our waitress what was special about theirs and she said that its the sourdough in the dough  she also said that they had just changed their frying oil which made them extra delicious im sure   and my husband said the cafe au lait was to die for as well   please dont waste your time going to the other beignet places unless what you really want is a crispy fried funnel cake no lie stop by morning call on your way in or out of new orleans and you wont be disappointed  open 247my husband and i go to a matter of taste every sunday for brunch we have never been disappointed the food is outstanding personally we think the food is under priced we love the gf biscuits with blueberry preserves and the huevos rancheros the owner is always friendly and very accommodating we love this little nook in our neighborhoodamazing food they were super quick at getting it out to us the place is comfy i love it my new favorite placeworth the wait and the hype get the old fashioned buttermilk pancakes with a side of bacon and fruit i topped my pancakes with bananas and will now die happy those pancakes are what dreams are made ofthe highest quality of cold or hot subs and italian paninis in st petersburg  the bread for the sub is made onsite high quality meats veggies and their own yummy coleslaw red pepper condiment  the subs are only 500  eating a sub without mayo or mustard is really refreshing  eat one here btw i really doubt you will be able to eat the whole thing in one sitting and you will never go to subway again unless someone else pays  you will be surprised about the weight of the sub that is packed with yummy things  if not having lunch there is a bakery with all of the goodies inexpensive coffee bar cheese and wine room fresh pasta deli olives etc  its a st pete landmark for a reason     visit on a nonsaturday if you like elbow roomwhat a great tour very informative  my family and i wasnt planning on going on the budweiser brewery tour but since we were in town we just had to go plus it was free im not much of a beer drinker but do drink every now and then but this tour was very interesting  our guide was very good and threw in some jokes from time to time which mainly was focused on the chicago cubs    as for the reviewer mentioning about not bring babies or toddlers my 3 year old daughter loved the tour so much was going on around her that she was distracted  of course she just had to have a stuff clydesdale in the gift shop   some people are on vacation or trip and dont have a sitter    great tour will do this again next time we are in townthis place is amazing my friends and i just happened to stumble upon it and we felt so lucky its delicious affordable fresh and authentic the people there even gave us a free extra dish just because they wanted us to try it we tried it and loved itget their lavender latte with cocounut milk and an espresso shot guaranteed life changeri hesitated to give 5 stars only because it is more of a take out place for me but for what it is it deserves 5 stars  this is not the sit down with a date kind of place although their dining area is clean and well kept  i think it is 5 star worthy for the quality of food you get for the price i make crab rangoon and because of that i usually dont like restaurants crab rangoon but theirs is excellent  their dishes are also very fresh and flavorful  my favorite is the roast pork in garlic sauce which they modify for me to not be hot ive never had a problem with the service they are always very friendly and fast highly recommendthe only bad thing is that they dont have a good ac system the place is very cool the food is excellent and the beer is cheap too i love coming here also if you want a focused buttoned up server who can answer your every question dont go here however if you want to be served by an authentic fun a bit spacey hipster this is the spotamazing hidden gem this store is too little but have full of valuable things so much fun to check out all different kinds spices teas and snacks   and their coffee hazelnut coffee is amazing i drink a lot of coffee but i like to drink decaf it is really hard to find good decaf but i found one in philly their hazelnut coffee is so aromatic just brewing at home made you feel good i got like more than 10 packages so far and loving them   also got bunch of spices cumin wasabi powder paprika anise rosemary red and white pepper just make it they have all   the owner lady doesnt speak much initially but once she recognize your face she is the sweetest so helpful and get chatty i had so much  fun talking to her and looking forward going back there once weather get warmyummy apple cobbler definately did it after a delicious dinner across the street   must come back again next time im visiting from cathey have the best bagels in town i have been coming here since high school and still stop by when i am back in town the employees are always friendly and efficientim definitely a beginner when it comes to yoga but wanted to give it a try and im glad i started here everyone is so nice and welcoming and the classes are extremely helpful the instructors give a lot of personal attention to everyone in the class which is extremely nice for beginners like me as well i highly recommend trying one of the hot yoga classes one night for an awesome sweaty workouteach  every time i go home to visit my family in stl i make it a point to get my happy ass to a ted drewes do the same and you wont be disappointed custard is so much better than ice cream and i swear that ted drewes custard must have opiates in it so insanely delicious go nowthis is one of the best if not the best bbq places in the tampa bay area  seriously smoky and delicious meats especially the ribs and the brisket    we go here every now and then for the darn cheap brisket and pulled pork sandwiches and bring back a bunch for the office as well  that always gets us some brownie points   i hate to admit it but ive never gotten any sides here before  i dont even know if they have sides their meats are so good  and after all isnt the point of bbq the smoked meat    i know this is a bbq truck but its a heck of a lot cheaper than hungry harrys also great bbq but is of similar or slightly better flavor and quality    if you want to sit down to eat your bbq just bring it back to your car and take a lean on the hood as you enjoy your brisket with the traffic whirring bygreat service awesome ice cream and water ice love going there staff is very pleasant and helpful with my family parking on site and that is great keep up the great job mint is a new vietnamese restaurant just opened a really nice modern place im big on pho  it did not disappoint me my favorite is the wild slider with pork belly must try great staff  bartenderpretty much the best place to get boba tea and shaved ice in the st pete area ive been here a few times and everything i have ordered has been made exactly how i thought it would be i feel that you cant go wrong with anything on the menu the fact they serve sticky rice with many of their dishes get an a for me   you can tell their food is made fresh and with  a lot of love it is a must try when in the st pete arearick lewis is pretty much mark mcgwire the guy just keeps hitting home runs when he opens restaurants first southern and now grace meat  three by the way i do realize mcgwire took steroids but who didnt back then it was the thing to do in the 90s as was the macarena what a time to be alive  i met my brother here for a cheat day meal i couldnt think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the grove  in order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of bbq pork ribs  our four sides cornbread mac and cheese fried potatoes and greens  review hot chicken unlike lewis other hot chicken place southern this place only has one heat level its certainly spicy but not too spicy as expected the chicken was big juicy and crispy it got my nose running and eyes watering loved it its pretty much what youd get at southern from what i could tell thats good    bbq ribs not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent sweet glaze more than likely ill be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but thats 100 because the hot chicken is the mayor of flavor town  fried potatoes ours were fresh out of the oven very crispy thick and good seasoning  mac and cheese not bad could have been more cheesyeverything in the world could be more cheesy though in my opinion the crumble on top added a nice flavor  cornbread tasty not too sweet more bread than cornwhatever that meanswink wink  greens im not a greens guy but my brother liked it  conclusion paragraph i had high expectations going in especially since ive limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks a bad cheat meal would have  a sad scott however i was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern foodmy go to place in east nashville three suggestions  1 serve enough fries  2 offer pita with meals salads and soup 3 more chicken and orzo in the soup thankswe had the salmon burger and beerbrined chicken every item was excellent and cooked to perfection a great improvement since i was here last years ago the herbed butter and sauces are amazing they also have mastered pickled vegetables as well something that enhances dishes that feature them even in an ancillary role   once again im tempted by the poutine but its 107 degrees today and although the ac is great it seems off to order it one day  by the way if its hot have the drink called the cooler it is worth it  our tall server gentleman with the green eyes was greatwe took a tour at 2 pm and it was a great way to start the brew place is interesting on how they make all the manic happen with their amazing brews  i generally love the saisons but the sumo stout and abraxas stout were top notch and would drink more if didnt have to drive  stouts were so smooth flavorful  love this placeneeded a last minute dinner choice last night great choice of craft beers fast and friendly service loved the burger this is a topnotch venuejust had chicken taco steak taco and chicken salad chicken was a little cold from sitting on the cool salad container the chicken was fresh and juicy the steak taco was delicious and had ample meat for the taco size the salad had a zesty lime based salad dressing which was delicious my regret is that i did not order enough food so my wife asked me to go out and get more tacosthis place is so amazing love the food the staff is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is unbeatable i love sitting by their wood burning fire place to enjoy a late dinner i personally think cyranos is the most well managed and appealing restaurant in webster groves this place is top tierthis has to be my new favorite chinese restaurant  extremely modern decor  very reasonable prices specially the lunch menu during the week  the food is great a modern twist on classic chinese food  i would definitely recommend if youre in the area i will be back myselfwe went with the simple choice and were not disappointed eggs bacon and buttermilk pancakes i cant put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good but the pancakes were divine worth it in our opinion even saw a girl from the voice while dining herewhat a great happy hour gotta be therethey are really great with making cakes last minute as i can attest to ive had a sampling of most of their cakes and theyre all delicious a little too sweet for my personal preference but thats not a bad flaw to havei finally tried this place tonight it was very quiet which i love when i want to carry a conversation josh was our server what a great guy on the ball very informative no is not in hos vocabulary  got mussels marinara as an app  i have never seen so many mussels on 1 plate i swear it must have been 3 lbs and they were all as plump all of our food huge portions and delish dessert was over the top its my new fav italian restaurant cant wait to go backone of the best coffee shops in town they have a variety of nondairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte i went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk it tasted amazing i topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee thank you for offering vegan options i will be backwhat a happy mistake it was to randomly run into this place while exploring the garden district in new orleans the donuts were out of this world i cant believe they have new ones everyday i was with a group and we split a few so we could try a selection would definitely recommend stopping byknockouts opened on super bowl sunday and i have been there twice so far to taste the fare the decor is that of a boxing ringgym it is very clean with a fair bit of room it is surrounded by a dozen or more tvs for watching multiple games playing at the same time their food is focused on standard barpub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods there is a second lounge area that is still under construction they intend to have karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar the new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area  on the first visit i ordered the bbq burger i forgotten the name it is under on the menu it is a 13 pound burger patty served with onion rings bbq sauce and i believe lettuce and tomato the burger stands pretty tall too tall for a human being to eat it however removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level the flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a bbq burger the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart i had a side of onion rings and they were excellent  my second visit was today and i only ordered an appetizer for lunch the stuffed deepfried mushrooms the site of the mushroom heads was about 2 across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried i think this diminished the whole stuffed aspect of the mushrooms as there didnt seem to be much stuffing in evidence the flavor of the mushrooms was excellent as was the texture of the mushroom flesh very firm and moist  they do have a pool table 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous touch tunes music system the staff is very friendly and i found the service to be prompt the food took a little time to get out but i suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks  im giving this 5 stars for a sports bar i cant think of anything id change in the place ill update the review once the new lounge opens and i have a chance to put the bartender through hisher paces with some classic cocktailsover my 68 years i have eaten a lot of pralines some delicious some not so much but i can say with absolute certainty that they make the best praline i have ever had they arent cheap but they are worth every penny im just glad i live 70 miles away or i would go there all too oftenthis place is still unbeatable inexpensive incredibletasting wholeingredient ice cream is where its at   the staff is great and the portions are enormous love these guysmy favorite gem  i love this place its small with only a few tables so sometimes u wont be able to get a seat but thats the only problem other then that its delicious the best u ever had and the sliders are delicious  plz give them a tryif good beer is what you seek look no further bier has got it going on and proudly has all their accolades displayed on the wall as they should the belgian dubbel won second at a world beer festival excuse me for not remembering the official name so you know its legit when they make it better than most belgians do  the staff is so friendly and willing to answer any and all questions about the beers brewing process and their business its family owned and they brew 150 different beers a year every week the tap list rotates and itll never be the same twice   they have trivia live music euchre tournament and other events throughout the week and unfortunately i didnt get to sample the food truck when i was there but ive heard its great if youre in indy bier is not to be missedhad lunch here for my birthday on october 7th and was not disappointed  it was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didnt have to wait that long to be seated there was seating both outside and inside but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier  my boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb maybe it was 6lbs lolz crab to share that was the special of the day but out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on  once our food arrived we dug right in everything tasted so delicious and fresh we finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind the shrimp salad was surprisingly good it was light and the shrimps were juicy the crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter   i definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worthtake someone with you when visiting the mello freeze  this will allow you to at least sample two different items  growing up in the area brings back great memoriesthe brown derbies the slushes

check out my full review httpgoodyummyeatswordpresscom20130804vientianecafebestlaotianthaiinphillyhappened upon this place visiting family from out of town and were happy to get a quick and yummy bite before heading to meet up with family its a small little place with a lot of classic italian dishes some sandwiches and st louisstyle pizza options my husband and i split a sandwich and got italian

toohad 2 mac and cheese dogs now im hooked cant beat a combination of bacon  mac and cheese cant wait to try other secret menu items follow their instagram for their secret menu options they dont have every item every night but hey that makes me wanting to go back to try them when they are availablei would start listing my favorite things about smileys but the list would be impossibly long new york has incredible middle eastern food but this is bar none the best ive ever had in my life best chicken schwarma best seasoned falafel best and most massive vegetarian platters the portions are huge and did i mention delicious two very hungry people could make a great meal out of one serving ive had the garlic chicken shredded white meat with many optional sauces making each bite a different taste experience as well as the vegetarian platter which was so gigantic that my very hungry friend and i still had two containers to take home everything tasted fresh and delicious the service is also five stars smiley and mrs smiley go out of their way to make sure you are charmed and satisfied whether thats sending over free baklava or extra smoothies so that everyone can have a try  im happy to say

pretty quickly i got the powdered sugar in a separate bag so it wouldnt melt and wow theyre not stingy i had so much powdered sugar my little brother double dippedtripled dip drowning out each bite my family loved it thumbs up   frozen coffee gave me enough energy for my long drive back to houston and kept cold for hourswent here for the first time today  drawn by the amazing smell of the charcoal grill  looked around for a menu  couldnt find onethen a regular in the line said  theres only one thing on the menu any given dayline was slowhad to wait almost 15 minutes with just 5 people in front  the food was incrediblethe hummus was fantasticthe falafel fantasticthe greens were easily separated and tossedthe chicken was tender and amazingly tastyand the ricelentil mix no idea what it really is was terrificthere was also a giant piece of breadwhole bunch of food for 10  definitely worth the waitdefinitely worth going back againlove this place chill atmosphere very informative staff and friendly   vast beer selection wish i had a place like this in california will miss itfrost is worth all 5 stars  i had driven by frost so many times as i play soccer frequently at udall park   i finally made my way in and as impressed with the overal appeal of the store  the case that they display all their selections is over the top but beautiful  i couldnt take my eyes off of everything and wanted to try everything  well i stuck to my favs and had a banana chocolate combination and it was so good  the kids really loved it as well  its also affordable and the kids that work here are so friendly and helpful   must gothe attendant was extremely helpful  we were looking for a fairly uncommon liquor and they had it pretty good selection friendly staffwow   soooo full    great staff   delicious food   byob   good times      i loved the wings tofu and the catfish     i cant wait until im back in town to visit    its slowly becoming my undisputed go to restaurant when im philly   also heard from a patron that uber eats started delivering    wish i lived closer so i could enjoy more frequently    absolutely one of my favorite spots for a good meali cannot speak highly enough about this place and their amazing coffee every single one of the staff are refreshingly friendly and extremely well trained the coffee is so consistently good and fresh no matter what you buy or who makes it for you and the atmosphere is comfortable and esthetically pleasing i love it here and am a customer for lifebe patient the ownerchefcook whatever you want to call him hes unqiue talks a lot and can be difficult to understand but you can see he simply loves to cook he doesnt skimp nor cheat you he asks whatever you can pay for and gives you more the food is great but its his love of customers  food that drives this businessthe coffee ice cream is a musttry the flavor is great not too sweet not too rich it is just righti give this an overall five stars for the entire experience  i visited my sister in la and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin to santa barbara for the weekend    the shellfish company sits on the end of the sterns warf which is one of the longest deepwater pier between los angeles and san francisco  from the outside you can see the tanks of fresh abalone dungeness crab and the infamous spider crab  you must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit  the inside is a classic you are here for the food not the ambiance  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating be careful it can get windy my sister and i sat at the bar  the bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some   we however were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staffbartenders who were really awesome enjoying life kinda people  they tipped it to the official 5 star review   we started with the abalone for an appetizer which was really good perfectly seasoned and cooked i also had to try the chowder  awesome but maines is better   they have a decent array of beers on tap and i chose a local brew  for dinner we split the spider crab cause we aint scared of shh ok maybe i was a littleit was huge  the dinner combo i believe came with choice of soup or salad  splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people i recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood  my one critique is that i thought the spider crab was over cooked  it by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but i know my seafood   overall one of the best experiences ever  if you go to santa barbra you must go herewow a client recommended this place to me like a million other new yorkers our move to tampa has not found great food this place is the real deal if i could give ten stars i would deli coffee bakery homemade pasta everything you need and even what you dont this will be on my monthly shopping list for sure treat yourself  ps the meatball parm sub was amazing well worth the drive from tampafinally the brick and mortar version of spot has arrived  inventive burgers the freshest ingredients and a lively family friendly atmosphere get there during the off peak times if you want to be ensured a seat this place fills up fast  looking forward to eating my way through the burgers then the other hot specialty sandwiches    still sniffing the fat and juices on my fingers long after the burger is gone sad to have to wash my handsvisited mangia for the first time today with my girlfriend what a pleasant experience great drinks amazing food and friendly service would highly recommend glad to have great italian food on this side of eighth avenueawesome fresh ingredients good service and a solid menu cant go wrong its a great addition to sohogot the cheesecake at the coffee x change on tangue verde  it was really good  i heard others talk about the muffins and canolis  will def put that on the list for next timeone of the best and friendliest indian restaurants in this area and tampa i live nearby and eat a lot of indian food between california and florida in my life gateway is one of the top 3 indian restaurant i have eaten at the service is always so friendly and the staff takes time to make small talk with you which is unusual i order out or eat in almost every weekthis is so perfect for manayunk especially for those of us on the go to be able to grab a quick healthy snack its always clean and the staff is always friendly sometimes the flavors arent my favorite but i love being creative so i find a way to make it work for what my mood is that day love this placemy fivestar review has a lot to do with the fact that mr wizards is about a quarter of a mile from my house which means we can walk there thus burning off about 110 of the calories we are about to consume another reviewer called the location dogtownish but it is actually richmond heightsish meaning that it is really truly in richmond heights it is right off of 64 on big bend so if youre cruising through town hop off and try it also if you are dining at any of the maplewood establishments on manchester mr wizards is a pretty easy walk from there   now to the good stuff i cant vouch for all menu offerings because my goto is a concrete with butterscotch and pecans delicious my bf likes the malts  i cant settle the mr wizards v ted drewes argument because i am new to town but it is very hard to imagine that drewes serves anything betterprice of jim beam 18 best i found in french quarter great service great family business 6 smokes and they deliver gonna hit them up every time im down herei love coming here especially today my husband and i love coming here and sampling the fine donuts and sliders today we got some donuts to go because it is so hard to pick just one or two we got them home and the box collapsed in the middle and it was all bad for the tasty goodness that was our donuts if you have ever had their donuts you know how sad this event was so we went back to go buy replacements for our fallen donuts and we told the amazing staff what occurred they not only gave us the donuts we ordered but gave us one on the house to replace the fallen donuts not only is the food amazing but the staff is too thank you for reinforcing my love of district donutsoki went on the tour to get some free beers however i never get tired of seeing the clydesdales the bottling plant and just how clean and organized everything is at the brewery if mickey mouse could drink hed hang out at this place because its a lot like disneys prim and proper order  the staff is always friendly and well rehearsed they know their beer facts which leaves me with one more point the hospitality room order up two fresh beers on tap munch on some pretzels and kick back for about 20 minutes ahhone of the best food trucks in philadelphia  this is coming from a person that doesnt like trying to things extremely picky and not very daring everything on their menu is so good and filling my favorites are veggie burger wrap which is 5 instead of veggie burger itll be in a tortilla but somehow 10x better and chicken satay tacos 2 for 7 their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too   beware of the long lines though try to avoid going anytime from 11451230 if you do expect a long wait and no you cannot call ahead and order if youre a drexel student go in between class guaranteed no line   cash onlyfirst time venturing out to brewerytown   anyways the burgers were so good you can get them medium rare or to other likings the buns were that soft potato roll quality like shake shacks the size is bigger thicker than shake shack but smallerthinner than regular steakhouse burgers  what made the burgers so good were flavors  i got umami burger which has sauce based on korean ssamjang misochili pepper paste and topped with mushrooms and shredded lettucecucumber i wasnt sure how the sauce will play with the burger but boy did that combo work lk the name lot of umami from the sauce with a nice refreshing balance from the veggies ive never had a burger taste like this before  bf got butcher burger which had onion tomato and horseradish sauce the sauce in there was also awesome giving the greasy burg an extra kick   service was quick and friendly not a lot of space for a large group though   oh and its byob we picked up some beer from rybrew across the street while waiting for the burgers there seem to be other cool new spots around here like crime and punishment brewery and aforementioned rybrew which is somewhat like fooderylegitimately 50 cheaper than stores on canal street bought sazerac rye herbsaint and a large bottle of peychauds for 56 versus the 97 it would have cost at the roosevelt hotels gift shop  also insanely vast selection including but not limited too two kinds of orange bitters and celery bitters i was pretty sure you could only find those things online or in specialty shops in new york city   now you knowdelicious healthy homecooked style food highly recommendedexcelente la comida  las costillas ribs fueron deliciosas  we will return  the service was great toogreat market fresh pasta freshly baked bread for 350 or less fine cheeses great wine cellar limited produce full service meat dept with dry aged beef really good sandwiches for unbelievably low prices  5 to 550 place can get very crowded especially at lunch timefor travelers or commuters 30th street station is the first sight of the city the location where youve formally arrived in philly and though i love that station eversomuch when it comes to ambiance within for a snack or a sip the pickins are a little slim enter the rotisserie a permanent food truck offering at 30th sts the porch open for lunch 7 days a week from 11am2pm and wednesday through saturday from 49pm serving drinks from a beverage trailer those hours too rotisseries vibe is bright light and colorful most of the eats come from a 7 spit rotisserie oven and for me the highlights included the spit roasted veggies the fish tacos which were awesome great salsa verde and the lamb flatbread  unfortunately the porchetta i was looking forward to the most was not my favorite but the spicy mayo and the pickled vegetables as well as the saucy wings and things more than made up for even the momentary disappointment from the porchetta their booze options from great canned and draft beer options to the lazy lemonade a refreshing rum beverage that totally started the weekend off right are affordable and the colorful seats and umbrellas and the playful lighting made sure that id be back again soon regardless of whether im catching a train or notoutstanding most of their stuff is 110 calories per serving  that is not a lot compared to ice cream yet the taste and texture are amazingvery good pizza the owner is wonderful the place is renovated  everyone seems to be friendly really want you to enjoy your food french fries are good salad and also the chicken fingers im a vegetarian so i dont know too much of the other meals but i do know everything else is good and my kids love the chicken fingersthe donut paninis are outstanding the kolaches are delicious there isnt a thing on the menu i didnt want to try my heart is so lucky we do not live in the neighborhoodgreatly enjoyed the shellfish here and the service is excellent the lobster roll is delicious clam chowder was definitely a hit the lobster bisque was a little too heavy on the tomato but still good and the local rock crab was fantastic   highly recommend this place if youre enjoying some time on the pierlove love love     this place us a great vibe with an authentic feel   the free coffee is a major plus    definitely need to come backi didnt use to frequent the market often but my coworker made me go after work one day and now it has become our friday treat after a long day at work the chicken enchiladas are awesome no really im hooked and the southwest chicken salad is good hot or cold and bc i spread the word i have to buy it weekly before my mother in law gets its there nice here always helpful we tried the chicken taqutios today guess what also good we will be back again n again great flavorawesome service food is made quickly but accurately it is so fresh i just wish they delivered to me but its good enough that i am willing to drive there to get it also try their day old bread for 50 it is a full baguette and makes great garlic bread to accompany your dinnerlove this place come here frequently with friends for the coconut cake and a cup of coffee affordable amazing service and a great location i loved grabbing dinner here with my husband for a quick date out i would have tried everything on the menu if i could have but make sure you at least try the baklava  will definitely be coming backour son  his wife sent us the heart shaped box of chocolate covered strawberries with a happy anniversary balloon for our 50th wedding anniversary this past saturday the store called to make sure we were home the driver wished us a happy anniversary and the strawberries are still delicious and keeping well in the fridge i would definitely send these to someone else well worth the priceexcellent service at this port of subs line gets extremely long on the weekends but it moves quickly always fresh and yummythis is probably my favorite food truck in tucson as its a great alternative to a taco they are typically outside hotel congress sat  sun nights crooked tooth brewing and tap  bottle however last night we had them before the all souls procession on the lot across from the mercado   i love their corn arepa and have had both the chicken and shredded beef fillings 7 each which were very good we also ordered a side of plantains for 3bittersweet is a delicious problem to my waistline everything they make is incredible from the cupcakes to truffles to handmade chocolates to the waffles on saturdays in addition the owner is very sweet and all her employees are kind and freindlyi have never had a bad experience here it doe not get better than thiswe just had my daughters first birthday party and ordered from testas the blackwhite cake with buttercream frosting  we also ordered a single minisized same cake just for my daughter  they were both delicious  service was exceptional  they scanned a photo for the halfsheet easily fed 30 ppl and it came out greatwe had to go to costco to buy a new tv we wanted to avoid driving 465 coming from bloomington so we decided to go to this location instead of castleton we were sort of dreading going on a saturday afternoon thinking it would be a madhouse from the parking lot to the check out line boy were we wrong the greenwood costco is the most mellow low key costco i have ever visited   seriously we were blown away plenty of parking not crowded nice people working there lines not too long at check out clean   i have been to costco locations from california to indiana and this is my new goto location have been visiting the costco in castleton but this location is so much nicer only wish that there was a trader joes nearby  another cool thing this location has so much more indian food than any other costco i have been to i assume its due to a larger population of indian people in the area   we asked the cashier why it was so mellow there and she said i think its because we are so new but honestly i would think that would be a reason for them to be crazy busy there regardless of the reason it was the best costco experience i have ever hadthis is my favorite coffee shop love the atmosphere and the coffee and food are excellent if you go for breakfast  you have to try the bacon biscuit sandwich whenever we come to tampa to visit this is at the top of our list on where we have to stopme and my family went yesterday we ordered 12 donuts all different we didnt know that you couldnt order with two toppings bc they only can hold one topping  the donuts where made fresh and topped to order they were amazing they did take a little longer because they are fresh but we made it just before a rush they were warm and great would highly recommend a little bit more expensive than dunkin but worth it im not normally a cake donut no yeast here fan but these are a treati need rehab i need rehab i order 2 original banana puddings on uber eats every weekend it is consistently delicious the best ive had thus faralways fresh and fast once you taste these it ruins the other places for you going back to a starbucks dunkin or grocery store bagel is just not an option  all the cream cheese flavors are mixed fresh in the store the veggie cream cheese is awesome the owner is also charitable and frequently provides local nonprofits with end of the day bagels it bears mentioning that he does so because everything is made fresh each morning so there are no carryoversbeing my husband and i travel to central america and hopefully one day to cuba we love authentic latin cuisine   our first visit we ordered the cuban sandwich black bean soup platains and cafe cubano each was delicious weve gone back multiple times and have had consistent delicious meals the cost is an added bonus as you get decent portions   the interior is colorful fun and reminded us of a small cuban style restaurant weve been to in guatemala  kudos to you on keeping everything authentic broad ripple  please take note of this jem as we need more like itdelicious and great service we had six items on the menu including dessert and each item was melt in your mouth deliciousi have been wanting to come here since i seen the reviews on yelp well on yesterday  i decided to go after church i am so so so glad i got a chance to go this place exceeded my expectations i think i ordered almost everything on the menu lol  the donuts were so fluffy and delicious the sliders are absolutely amazing  please dont get me started on the cheese fries awesome  i never heard of candied jalapeos til now  they were heavenly  i wish they werent out of cinnamon rolls because i really wanted to try them  the place stayed rolling in with people  i thought they wouldve been less packed on a sunday afternoon but they were not  love love love this place and i cant wait to get back asapsuch a cute ice cream parlor inside makes you feel like a little kid again behind the counter are three amazing employees named alicia alex and emma they provided the most impeccable customer service to patrons of all ages in addition to the great service the ice cream is deliciousfor us a trip to tarpon springs would not be complete without stopping at hellas we visited twice recently both times we enjoyed outstanding greek salads tasty treats from the extensive bakery friendly and attentive service as well as the pleasant greekinfluenced atmospherethe best cheese steaks around such nice and friendly staff dont think i have ever had any issuesi know what youre thinking 5 stars really  if youre into craft beers this place has a nice selection to choose from atypical from other rally gas stations this place is almost like a beer haven my buddy is pretty big into craft beers he literally spent a sold 20mins browsing through their selection looking for any rare beers to bring back to south florida the selection is impressive for a gas stationconvenience store thats why i offer the 5 stars craft beeriron hill is always a good choice scratch kitchen everything is made in house breads sauces and most importantly beer each location has a micro brew set up this place is a true beer lovers heaven it is not just a brewery in name like some places try and pass off the meat loaf is always a good choice and it is not something i typically eat out also the chicken pot pie is very good it is a little pricey i think it should be about two and a half dollar signs on here but you are paying for quality my favorite part is getting ordering all the new beers in the sample sizes and all the waiters are very knowledgeable on the beers big dan in the kitchen is always serving up great foodtheres ice cream and then there is creole creamery ice cream made fresh right in the store its better than cold stone baskin robins or anything else you can buy in a grocery storeat the midpoint of a bike ride we had the chicken gyros and falafel sandwich for lunch and they were wonderful ingredients are fresh and flavorful and the staff overseen by the effusive smiley were consistently friendly and helpfulgreat family owned restaurant with fantastic mexican food and byo t  medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room  the service is fantastic even when weve shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable  the margaritas they mix are great which is saying something as i typically dont enjoy margaritas  the food is delicious and parking is very easy in the area  if you find yourself in northern liberties give it a try  they frequently run specials on groupon and living social so keep your eyes open and save a few bucksbe prepared to feel like a kid in a candy store  i come here every once in awhile and am always overwhelmed by their selection a mixed six packed or two can make for a great evening and present i bought one for my roommates boyfriends bday one year   staff is friendly and helpful and they do have a deli for light food  note they do not post prices on the beers or in the fridgeyou must look it up in the manifest so you may be surprised at the price when you get to the register just put one back or swap it out for something cheaper i came here with my girlfriends and let me tell you it gets packed fast we ate oysters for breakfast and it was so worth it the server that we had memorized all 6 of our complicated customized orders i was very impressed oysters here taste like the fresh ocean i ordered the oyster poboy and that deliciousness came out fast i definitely recommend this place when visiting nolacostco does it for me they fill every one of my sensory and retail needs yes im a big fan  i can kill an entire afternoon at costco and not even realize that ive missed appointments gatherings meetings and conference calls as per the usual at a lot of these members only box clubs they offer tons of samples and of good stuff too there was one saturday that we were sojourning around the warehouse and stumbled across kobe beef lunchmeat what yes kobe beef lunchmeat samples i couldnt believe my palate   at this location i havent encountered anything but polite helpful employees that are usually eager to please i love how they know exactly where to direct me regardless of what department theyre stationed in the only exception ive run into is the older lady who works in the cell phoneelectronics area she doesnt seem to be grateful for employment anytime i go there but her comrades in the rest of the store more than make up for it  keep costcoing costco  youre the master of itit is a true italian market they have a wide selection of fresh groceries meats pasta yes fresh pasta breads and cheeses they also have a very large selection of frozen pasta and pre made pasta dishes to take home for a quick dinner they have a sandwich counter that also has fresh made dishes lasagna chickeneggplant parmigiana ravioli manicotti etc theres a coffeeespresso bar bakery wine cellar and cheese room as well i havent had anything there that i havent loved i like to take advantage of the panini of the day when i can make it in the time if recommend to go is during the fall they have pumpkin ravioli and gnocchi pumpkin cheesecake drink and a thanksgiving inspired paninii think i am giving it five stars because this place was a real surprise i have never been to a place like this just altogether special in decor service food and drink you will not regret swinging by here  one the place is adorable upon first glance one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory but more like a factory that a group of ragtag children made into a playhouse vibrant color flowers natural lights fun stair cases decorative window panes really fun environment   service was a little slow but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference i let it slide waitress and hostess were really friendly   this place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations i came back a second time just to try another one first one i had was the hogthaied which was a peanut glazed burger served with thai rice noodles soooooo goood the one i had the next day was the american if youre worried about your cardiovascular health please dont eat this one it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried macncheese lets just say it changed me fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces loved the sriracha mayo a must try   they also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas shakes loved the cinnamon shake as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound   if youre looking for the place in downtown st louis please stop herehealthy food is a rarity in nola and hk does healthy food fast i live in the campus area and i love the convenience of this place the menu covers it all really so whatever im in the mood for they usually have ittheir tacos are amazing we had al pastor chicken and asada tacosthey have different authentic hot sauces that were really good too we also had some horchata and lemonade their juices are freshly made theyre delicious last but not least the service was great super nice and warm i would come back anytime highly recommendedlove this place aside from all the sushi rolls they have a great variety of japanese dishes as well the monkey ball is a must try the sushi is really fresh honestly a gem of iv they deliver through sbmenus as well so thats a plusstopped by for lunch again  i would have gone to a new england tradition the lobster roll but felt a little adventurous  and went for the lobster wrap with pico de gallo  a spicy mayo  can i say yum  the lobster had a touch of lemon that really helped bring out the flavor  it was nice and chunky not overdressed  it was served in a standard flour tortilla with kettle chips and a vinegar touched cold slaw  if i were you i wouldnt wait until you were in the area to stop by  its worth the trip  you can bring home a few live lobsters to booti really think when i walked into this store a choir of foody angels hovered above me and sang hallelujahthis place is a mecca of gourmet foods and unique ingridients that home or seasoned chefs would use you could literally build a basket for an episode of chopped in this store with minimal effort  i came on a saturday and it was like walking through costco or sams club except instead of frozen crap it was gourmet goodness showcased for your tasting pleasure cured meats nectars baked goods cheesecakes chips wine tastings deli items seafood dips and all the stuff you cant find anywhere else in tucson lines the aisles of this store   i have never been so awestruck by a grocer it was heavenly and i will gladly drive back again next time my culinary needs exceed the chops of safeway or frysi thought about writing something witty and entertaining but then i read what scott s wrote and his review was such a slam dunk i figure why bother   my one word contribution amazeballsused to be called the hamburger habit and they have chili fries at the goleta location since its the original location i love love love to take the family and get a burger with grilled onions onion rings and a chocolate malt this restaurant brings back childhood memories since i grew up in the goodland im glad this is now a chain so i can eat at this restaurant when i travel californiathis is my kind of place  they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert  the service on friday nights is fantastic    over the years the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever  its hard to get a seat so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night  that being said its not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here    i always order the coconut soup i order it with the tofu not fried and also the yellow curry with tofu  also not fried  it lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry  it is to die for  tastes like dessert  it is served with rice  last time i ordered the pho  my goodness the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces  hoisin and siracha  very good and filling  i would order it next time with more veggies they are very good at helping you with special orders  this is a byob and the prices cant be beat  the menu keeps getting larger and i only wish i were closer to this place as i would come here weekly for surestaff was friendly drinks were delicious orders were fast and efficient and prices are reasonable great place to grab a coffeewe had a wonderful breakfast here on a friends birthday my food was really really good  had omelet and potatoes very interesting taste combination on the menu omelet cant recall the name  companions had similar experiences  service was very good pricing is fairdelicious everything from start to finish loved the ceviche the enchiladas and finally the flan amazingloved this place i have never been to an ice cream parlor in which they had sweetened condensed milk as a drizzle ever since i was little my dad got me on putting condensed milk on fruits cake crackers and smoothies i didnt think anyone else knew about this until i came here i just had to get it on my ice cream so i chose the strawberry shortcake with the toppings of graham crackers whipped cream and strawberries with of course the condensed milk as my drizzle all for 7 cant beat that employees wore gloves and everything looked clean delicious will be coming back and bringing my dad lolgreat frozen custard at a great price the only potential drawback is if they dont have a flavor you want but that shouldnt even be a considerationfantastic

definitely make this my regular spot if i lived closerhavent had much experience in the line of cuban foodbut i do love a good cuban sandwich and taste of havana gave me my best cuban sandwich

important to me great customer service the staff is always wonderfulthe first store from table top cafe they have a wide variety of board games and card games to try and buy i have been to this location numerous times and i always have a good time with friends the staff is always helpful when it comes to suggesting or teaching games any time i visit i usually leave with interest in a new game   they have a good selection of snacks and beverages they have quite a few sandwich options available i recommend the grilled cheese table top has a wide variety of beer and adult beverages my wife usually gets an adult slurpee while i usually stick with their craft beers or coffee   its a 5 admission fee but your time is unlimited so you can have a long game session with friends or short

told us the door wasnt working so we decided to drunk the phenomenal beer and go in through the enter the girl in met p carly would have been pissed but its ok i drank her tearsso glad to have stumbled upon this place everything is homemade and amazing service was fast and jovialjovial i had the homemade bacon  potato soup and a chicken salad sandwich my mother had the same soup and a tuna salad sandwich homemade bread this was easily the best lunch ive had in a very long time highly recommended and hope to venture to plant city again just to eat herei kind of dont understand the place to be honest its like a mix of a place where you can drink beer all night have breakfast in or drink hot tea in the afternoon whatever it is its got pretty great stuff they have some beer flavors off the tap that ive never heard of before like strawberry shortcake lager which was what i tried it was good smelled like strawberries but tasted nothing like them i also had a taste of their pear cider which you can also get off tap and the flavor mixed with the fizz was actually really good not the kind where it sort of hurts your throat and with the ciders you wont feel the alcohol so much too so you wouldnt really know if youre starting to get tipsy or not we had some food along with the beers too we tried their pretzels with beer cheese dip the pretzels were freshly made and the dip was exquisite really good salty side to pair for a great night with beers and conversationsi found this little gem while passing through tn to see family during a move  loved it   1 im a greater seattle area girl at heart so i love finding these little driveup coffee stands no matter where im at if i spot one i have to try it out in hendersonville you will not find better coffee than this place   2 manual machines if you really appreciate espresso then youll appreciate the importance of what a manual espresso machine does for the taste of your drink   3 great location on a main strip easy to get in and out of  4 doublesided drive up windows and no callorder box the best coffee stands put you face to face with your barista right from the start  5 after coming here twice the owner had me an

reno the food was great the service was fast and the employees were super nicelate nite treat  i cant believe i still love this place  no lines  no fuss always what you expect  powdery sweet warm beignets and a hot yummy coffee  enjoyfinally made the trip to the unsuspecting spot where perennial resides what a gem  based in the bottom of a refurbished coke factory that now houses loft apartments this place is awesome as soon as we walked in the bartenders gave us a friendly greeting and asked if it was our first time  indeed it was  she then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day  my husband and i both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best my winner was midnight rambler a dark fullbodied belgian stout mmmmm mmmmm good  to pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind i am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus it also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart acidity to it i am drooling right now just thinking about it   our experience at perennial could not have been any better the beer the food the service all five star worthy oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from memphis to try the place very cool   got some great tips to use for our future home brews  this place is a winner and we cant wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their famous abraxas beer next monththe bagels were very good and the bagel and egg sandwich was delicious also the coffee was excellent the people that work there were very nice and i highly recommend this placei cant say enough good things   their gyros are amazing  we stopped in the bakery on the way home  i had the chocolate kok and it was really good  5 starsbest vanilla cupcakes ever  period  light and fluffy  their vanilla cake with buttercream icing is equally awesomedrove by this place and decided to stop in while looking for a breakfast place and im so glad we did the food was fantastic as was the coffee the staff was very friendly and accommodatingat the recommendation of samantha we tried the whipped ricotta with sour dough bread omg so delicious along with the wings not very spicy asparagus  portobello pizza and various tasting sized brews a great outing  very attentive service  clean venue  all around an enjoyable outingi pretty much never write a review but i have been using this panera for almost two years now not consistently but a couple times a month and the staffservice is always excellent everything is always fresh and my order is correct they do a great job making a large company feel like a mom and pop shop not to mention panera has the absolutely best bagels evermy favorite spot for brunch and lunch be prepared to wait but the wait is worth it friendly staff and terrific food more than make up for the delay unless youre one of those posters who says nobody eats there anymore  its too crowdedi love this place if you need a giant sweet fix  make sure to get their cleopatra sundae or their chocolate covered bacon so good  if you are a fan of beets which i am i advice you to get their beet salad it is alot of beets and alot of goat cheese but oh so good  the only catch to it is i feel like everything is a little over priced but i will pay a little extra for great food and wonderful service yum  i love to swing by smileys on my way home from work and pick up a vegetarian falafel platter their falafel is perfection far far better than couch tomato no surprise there since this is a mediterranean joint prices are fair food is super fresh their hummus is silky with just a hint of lemon yes carryout can take a little while but everything is made to order so im happy to wait or just call ahead do not miss this great little placei love mint ive only ever had good meals here fairly priced delicious food good vegetarian optionseveryone here is so nice they had 3 employees working and they all greeted each customer they explained their different cupcakes but i kept it simple with a red velvet and and wedding cake the cupcakes were great i cant wait to go back and try some different one   great experience a must gothe atmosphere was great we had amazing service by the server killian and the food was so good excited to return soonstart with table side guacamole a bit sweet but delicious smooth and creamy excellent next the market margarita pineapple juice agave nectar cilantro and jalapeo  unusual spicy with a hint of sweetness very good chicken tacos were great  the carne asada had good flavor but was not very tender  ive had much better  ambiance is suitable for first date not too dark very open seating casual dress ok music not to loud youre able to carry on a conversion  also very comfortable choice for business or eating alone  service was excellent eddie my waiter was very nice and helpful regarding the menu  also other waiters make sure you dont need anything very nice group effort in that regard nice outdoor seating available as well this is a bit upscale so expect that to be reflected in prices   and you certainly cant beat the nice touch of mini churros to go  highly recommendedate brunch at kanella today the first time we have been there  it really was a relaxing fun experience  the service from bill was great just enough with out being patronizing  we put him on the spot and basically made him order everything was great the rabbit soup with fava beans was fantasticwish i could get the recipe out of the vault  we will return again with a hearty appetite for really good foodrun to this place and get your free shot check in offer  even though it was jam packed with few seats open it was still easy to find street parking  there are many tables outside for enjoying the weather and plenty inside for those inclement days  we tried a hot cinnamon roll and it was gooey and delicious  the frosting was a bit lemony which really brightened the flavor up  i was in love with my triple shot latte  everything about coffeebar was charming and deliciousa coworker took me to lunch here this was my first time visiting a firehouse subs restaurant the restaurant was clean and the servers were very friendly and attentive my sandwich meatball was served promptly and was very fresh and hot the wheat bread was awesome they have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors the variety of subs leans to the healthy side they have only white and wheat bread there is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs but mostly they are pretty standard more like subway than like which wich i think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high 9 a great place to eat for a change up on sandwichesi love the fountain this is my favorite restaurant in st louis all of their food is delicious and interesting not your ordinary sandwiches and salads obviously the ice cream and ice cream martinis are great but i am partial to the hemingway which is absinthe and champagnewhere to start the coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch fries seasoned just right tartar sauce and the fish the  fresh clean battered perfect and meatythis is the best place in this entire area for breakfast we will come here over and over again  service is amazing  food is great  the portion sizes for your buck are unbeatable  keep up the good work cracker barrel we love youive been using no label for a few months now via market wagon as someone with celiac disease i can honestly say ive tried my fair share of gluten free things no label is by far the best gluten free bakeryfor bread cookies browniesanything unfortunately i am on the far south side of the city and rarely make it to the north side so i havent been able to visit their store front until now ive had to use market wagon to get their breads and baked goods i was so excited to finally be able to visit them they were actually fairly busy when we went on a saturday late afternoon we got in and out quick and they were very helpful i didnt see any bread out but if you dont see anybe sure you ask they had a ton in the back they just keep it in the fridge we purchased a lot since we arent able to make it up to carmel much we purchased a loaf of white bread a cereal bar peanut butter brownie and nutter butter cookie sandwich everything was so great my husband isnt gluten free but he even loved everything he tried i love no label and will always use them for my gf baked goodsi found out about this place through the lady that made my  sandwich at the oriental market on franklin rd they were there temporarily  but moved next to fred meyers for a more permanent placement   i really do admire boise and the way its growing ethnically  yay diversity in food in such a plus  once i herd about them opening a place like this i was so excited because i loooove vietnamese sandwiches back in san diego  i couldnt wait to try it here in my new home   they just opened 4 days ago and i highly do recommend giving this place a try if you want something new or different the customer service is awesome and the lady that works there is very welcoming she puts a smile on my face     they have sandwiches that are 12   you can order just the sandwich or a combo that includes a fountain drink and a side of chips   breakdown  combos depending what you get 495665 single 12 sandwich 300  495 they also sell variates of  spring rolls  yum and have a section for asian baked goods smoothies mocha freezes and boba drinks   my order  grilled beef sandwich  thai tea w boba  spring rolls   deliciousness     hope you guys enjoythis burger tastes like the one my dad made on the grill growing up i went back a cpl more times so good ppl were on top of it and the store was clean and fun im sure another visit will be made thanks  five guysi was on a trip to philadelphia when i had my very first cannolis there and omg i wasnt disappointed   fresh sweet and addictive are the best three words to describe my cannolis experience the filling comes in three different flavours chocolate vanilla and ricotta with chocolate chips i tried the ricotta and chocolate chips one and i cant even describe how heavenly it was   on the other hand i tried their claires naah not that good and i definitely had better ones in several other places but hey its an italian shop didnt expect them to make great french pastry anyways  i live in va but id drive all the way back to philly for those cannolis  bottom line this place gets 5 stars from me because of the cannollisgreat breakfast i had the egg sausage bacon hash and short stacks one of the best breakfast places ive had since kirby lane in austin tx we will eat there again before we leave nolabanana pudding  salty caramel  deliciousness in a cup   real slices of banana love the saltiness level of carmel it was a great sweet dessert with a dab of whipped creamgreat beignets and chicory coffee this location is closing its doors after 40 years this will be my first and last time here i would have liked to have come back i think i am now addicted to beignetscoming from a nyc sweetshater  these donuts are divine luxuriously extravagant and very creative i had a banana pudding donut with a house brew others on display were thai iced tea pbj and milk  cereal so cute   taste is absolutely bombcom will make it a pitstop next time im in noi love this place it keeps getting better and better my favorite is the rajin cajun sandwich but ive never had anything here that i dont like the owner is also a great guy who works there all the timethe place is absolutely beautiful nice and clean staffs are wonderful and nice they let you try any juice flavor you want super refreshing and organic my all time favors is almond milkraw honey artichoke chia coconutboh that tiramisu so good parts of it were a little dry but i still give it 5 stars kind of pricey though next time ill probably try the cheesecakeamazing allaround experience at jiallos as soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly we ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken with rice and beans and plantains and the food was all excellent if youre looking for a new food experience try jiallosold world coffee where to start  i dont drink coffee very much okay i dont drink coffee at all my drink of preference would be hot cocoa occasionally spiced i never doubt the quality of the drink here because the milk is really quite good also some of the baristas here have some stunning latte art dont know what that is you should ask one of them theyre all very experienced with what theyre talking about thats another great reason to come here  not only is there quality of service but theres also friendliness the baristas are always very kind helpful and informative about what it is they do   not only is everything about the service great the atmosphere is really cool too i often find the art that they put up on their walls interesting and unique and they change it out about once a month the wood and white theme they have going on is very aesthetically pleasing as well as nicely calming   this is definitely one of my favorite places to gothe dark chocolate sorbetto is an absolute miracle i dont know how something so creamy can possibly be dairyfree it is handsdown the best dark chocolate sorbet ive ever had top it with their todiefor peanut butter sauce and well deliciousness overload   ive also had the gelato and its always really good the hubs particularly likes the chocolate hazelnut gelato the cookies are also very good especially the ricotta cookies and the employees are all so friendly i was initially sad when whats the scoop left but i really love this placeordered a pizza for the first time love the crust just the right size and very yummy they make their own gluten free crust my daughter says its among the best the only thing is they dont have dairyfree cheese available but the pizza chef said we can bring our own and they will put it on for us i imagine it will be extra good melted in the wood burning oven the place smells awesome would love to go there just to smell the mix of aromaswood and baking pizzalove this place every time im in sb we eat here always fresh specials lots of funall i can say is wow the clam chowder is the best ive tasted in nashville the chicken salad is delicious and the cupcake was wonderful i will definitely be going backamazing pralines lots of interesting candy products and very friendly staff loved itits great m and my girl just left amc and we were hungry so we were right there close first time trying it we love it spending money there is great we came at the last minute they still served usmy review is simple the best cake ive ever had hands down there isnt even a close second they did my wedding cake and other desserts fabulous have you ever seen an entire wedding cake be devoured in about 30 minutes people couldnt get enough and it was beautiful highly recommend even if you dont need a large order just go get a cupcake you will dream about it for months wanting moregood food fresh and you can taste the quality good service as well went here at 730 on a saturday night and walked right in was pretty dead but probably because theres so much going on in the city state fair symphony on the prairie etc had the charleston blt which is a crab cake blt crabcake was huge all meat and tasted house made spinach and artichoke dip was good as well easy parkinggreat coffee and atmosphere right off of kennedy love the smells inside their cold brew coffee is strong and unique and their coffee that they market all over the tampa bay area is on the stronger side but for an experienced coffee drinker theres nothing better parking sucks at this location but if you can find a spot its well worth the trouble support local businesssthese guys are great  the coffee is delicious the vibe is relaxed yet well put together and the staff is friendly but not overbearing  go by  its a a cool spotwas not expected much until we arrived the it was packed outside not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient the custard was great i did not think it was overly sweet and some what light i had the tiramisu with pistachio and that was good kind of their version of it but none the less great would definitely go back when i am in townmazzaros market is fat kid heaven  when you walk inside through the arch you begin to smell the baked goods and coffees being made  i immediately dart towards the cookies and pitzelles grab a cannoli then make my way over to the fresh pastas being made if i could afford to live inside here i would but then i would eat everything and they would have to roll me out the door hands down this is the best italian market to get all your needs for a nice sunday dinneri really have loved the experience every time i go into body fuel the staff are always welcoming and full of advice its truly a great environment the acai bowls are top notchgreat place if you are a carnivoreand if youre not try the sides  ive had everything off of this menu and its all delicious  pulled pork bbq chicken sandwichrack of ribs corn salad mac and cheese baked beansjust writing this is making me hungry  its so awesome to have something this good and this authentic in the hood  not expensive either  informal but cozyi had a little happy hour dinner here with my girls after work great location right down the street from rosalitas i arrived early and got a table for the four of us our waitress was awesome very welcoming and knowledgeable i started off with the red pepper and gouda soup just as wonderful as it sounds plenty of substance not overly cheesy  very filling for a soup everyone else got one of the signature martinis everyone loved them except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it no problem they have small plates there which arent my thing but the one person in my party who got one liked it  there was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious at the end we each got desserts   this is definitely a dessert bar the portions were huge i seriously thought they brought me two i ordered a blondie and received a large brownie and a nice portion of ice cream i was in heaven just as delicious as it looked   great service great food great dessert all i need   on another note i love that they had several areas a bar an area with tables by the window and two sections with more personal seating sofas and comfy chairs in the back really something for everyone except for people expecting big burgerslets stop it with the shenanigans people this place is the cream de la crem yes that was intended after scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state i stumbled upon a good cup of coffee delicious red eyes coffee an eclectic tea collection and i dont say this lightly the best croissant in the 805   first a little about moi i am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from paris to brussels to omaha and i know a thing or two about frances favorite breakfast good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft fresh delectable middle peets coffee and starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the french press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough the only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is dangelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down   while it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than starbucks open past 10pm on most nights if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in you will be greated by an always friendly customer service team a low key and relaxing ambiance great beverages and the best damn pastries and gelato aroundwhat they did with this building is inspiring not to mention the unique food selection and also the regular bar favorites always great service love the depotbest frozen custard ive ever had i got the muni mocha and tried the cookie dough concretes both were delicious but maybe would have failed the inversion test great service and inexpensivesushi for 2 really more like sushi for 3 great service incredibly fresh fish comfortable environmentbest pies ive ever had  we buy a pie for every major family meal so ive tried nearly theyre entire selection the dutch apple pie and the sugar pie are my favorites  always nice to support a small business that makes a superior productso this is a delayed review because i forgot the name of this place but figured it out via google street view  i came here the day after the final day of the bar exam  i was drained in every conceivable way and had a hangover thanks ac that could only be cured with the best most gluttonous diner breakfast    everything my gf and i ordered was great  i got basically every breakfast item on the menu pancakes eggs hash browns bacon toast sausage and she got the cheesesteak  including a basket of great onion rings to start and 20 tip it was only about 30 which is what im used to paying per head for a weekend brunch  im crafting an excuse to travel over the bridge just to get some great homestyle diner foodnice merchandising in the lobby  fantastic breakfast for the morning after brewery crawls   they had trouble with the taps when we went but made up for it in heavy pours   the beer selection makes flights a little hard to choose from so go more than once to work through the brews you wont be sorryi have had the sundae pudding which is a banana bread pudding with walnuts it is so amazing my partner got the no nana pudding which is vanilla pudding it was good but the bananas and walnuts make it better i also got the walnut brownies which were really good too next time i will try the cupcakes they look perfecti was in town for a minifamily reunion  the desk clerk at the hampton inn recommended this restaurant  it was great  we did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table  but that is because it is so perfect everyone wants to eat there and never leave  the staff encourages this relaxed feeling we never felt pressure to eat and run  instead they offered frequent topoffs for our coffee and water   dana our server patiently explained the specials a few times over cause we couldnt make up our minds  she made sure that the decaf crowd and nondecaf crowd were served correctly  also she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items  she was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy   the food choices fit everyones needs savory or sweet veggie or not  interesting combinations of old and new  i had the mac egg whites veggie sausage spinach etc  it was very tasty and filling  also appetizingly presented on the plate   others in my party had variations of french toast and omelets  tasted the french toast and was in heaven  all food arrived promptly and at once  a request to cook a dish a little bit more was handled with ease  if i had more room i would have had one of the pastries which looked delicious thanks to all at the prep  pastry for making our family feel very specially treated and welcomei had been wanting to try this place for a while as it was really close to my internship its a cute tiny spot that seems good for getting a few hours of work done or even just chilling the crowd when i walked in was mixed it included a man busy at his computer as well as a mom  her child enjoying breakfast a couple others came in and out while i was ordering as well   i was really impressed with the beautifully crafted lucky goat latte i ordereddark chocolate hazelnut sea salt it was delicious the barista was also patient and nice as i looked over what to order i would definitely be back to try the other special drinks which all sounded amazing or try some of the fresh baked pastries im also curious about the iced coffee  one suggestion id have is for them to update their website the website still lists fall specials and i know they have a couple of new drink specials every season ill be back soon to try more items off the menuwhat is not to love about ted drewes   it was the first place my husband brought me on a pre marriage trip to saint louis  we ended up going four times in one weekend  the only thing that would make it better is if it was calorie freefavorite caffe from now on green apple ade plus banana walnut honey bread wow out of this world omg the smell of the banana cake is wow and did you see the packages presentationi was looking for sushi and was very intrigued with the 5 stars on yelp that i had to check it out omg i wasnt dissappointed from appetizers to desserts it was do good for 2 people i recommend just getting 1 of each appetizers to share the long rolls are 10 pcs if they are not busy ask for half rolls in order to try other samples the desserts were great too although it would have been better to use sticky or sweet rice instead of sushi rice overall another great recommendation from my fellow yelpersgreat local craft brewery in mercer county and is certainly much larger compared to their original lambertville location the new venue is clean organized and very much resembles the layout of allagash brewery in portland maine for anyone that has been to that one rh is expanding at an alarming rate due to the great quality of their beers especially their summer blonde which is extremely refreshing their beers are all unfiltered as opposed to other local craft breweries such as yards and flying fish were are filtered in order to sample you must take the tour because of new jersey law be sure to make a reservation and do not drink too much because ewing pd is literally next to the breweryexcellent little old school bakery maybe the best coffee cake aka crumble cake ive ever hadwell worth the 6 served at least 6 peopleamazing service  food menu and people  bacon pastry has no rival  simply amazingi hear good and bad about this venue but the fact is that i love that we have a real concert house in town that affords us the ability to see a level of entertainment that normally wouldnt be stopping in reno i dont know as much about sound as some of the others around here but when i go to a show i like to hear and feel it and i always get both at the knit from the first show i saw there the roots and the last one i made it to awolnation i am always satisfied when i leavewhat a great shop  i have been there several times and i only have good things to say about it  the store is family owned and all of the family members that work there are very friendly and knowledgeable about their product ask them anything  the selection of spices is huge i have browsed there for over and hour looking at all of their items just to give you an idea they have dozens of different salts and peppers alone lots of fun and unique items as well like spicy mayan chocolate great for brownies with a kick and rose water  i love the freezedried corn that they sell try itfive stars because it is a casino they have lots of slots everything from a nickel and up i play the unicorn slot machine because it reminds me of the unicorns my favorite band i usually walk away with the same amount of  i spent i make enough to buy a round of drinks  brittney mullen is the best cocktail waitress she is the fastest and nicest cocktail waitress ever request her many timesfantastic my favorite way to start a vacation in a new city bring cash because you will want to tip the guide well by the endi love their atmosphere and there are plenty of outlets  a little secret that most people dont realize there is an outlet outside in each lower corner of the two windows outside on the patio  i have tourettes syndrome and my uncontrollable tic is a cough  its not a real cough its tic like people who twitch but people think im sick  the baristas were very understanding and ive only had one issue with a customer i cant say im too fond that its no name coffee that sits in an airpot til its gone which could be a half hour or could me 3 hours unlikely tho but its really good   i would highly recommend this coffee shop  i love itthe ricotta cheese is key the super picky hubby loved the bbq chicken pizza and said everything was cooked to perfection no one flavor overpowering the other everything was perfect it was definitely worth the 30minute drive oneway to pick it up ordering and paying online made it super convenient and the pizzas were ready when we got theremy favorite starbucks the employees are excellent and learn the regulars however the parking kind of stinks but thats not their faultfor an old fashioned restaurant this place is truly ahead of its time highly recommend plenty of other reviews and pics of this place that i dont need to say anymore about it when in st louisyou gotta go herefreaky fast as always  got the jj gargantuan and it was made within 3 minutes  barely had time to fill my own drink  love the new location with this jimmy johns  it is clean the associates are very friendly greeting me on the way in and on the way out and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat  i am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of i465 and by many work places  my only regreti forgot to get a pickleive been here3 times now its great we had the same server the first two times and she was amazing i was a little disappointed the third time when we had another server but she was just as amazing its really tough to find a place with consistency anymore but this place rocks the food is delicious   you need to get here early early if you sleep in a little late be prepared to wait luckily weve beat he crowd every time there have been 515 people waiting for a seat each time we leftvery kind people i came in looking for some ginger tea due to some nausea i was experiencing the attendant there immediately took sympathy on me and made me a good ginger tea she didnt limit herself to that though she also gave me a free ginger ale free of charge and wished me the best of luck in feeling better she was quite motherly  very kind and nice the ginger tea was also great its these kinds of experiencing that make me happy to support local businesseslove chiptole all locations this location had great customer service and the food is siesta on pointi could not have been more pleased with this restaurant excellent pricing friendly service and down right delicious food even for indian standards i asked for authentic level hotspicy and they made the meal perfectly they also sport an impressive wine selection ill definitely be going backdeli counter is quick never lines and if there are they add more people to help fresh food the hours are great and the customer service is good no complaints here never had a problem at publixthis place was a wonderful find for a latenight meal we were at chaifetz arena for a concert on saturday night and were hoping to find somewhere to eat in walking distance so that we didnt have to drive and hunt it was 11pm so the first place we tried had already closed their kitchen we then decided to try the fountain we were pleasantly surprised to be cheerily welcomed in and told the kitchen was open and not only was the kitchen open but the menu options were great as a vegetarian i was pleasantly suprised to find multiple options i went with a veggie hummus sandwich on a unique and delicious bread they had several unique and healthy side options as well after a fairly healthy meal we decided we could treat ourselves to the chocolate banana malt and it was fantastic i am very glad we found the fountain in addition to the great menu the decor is really cool and the staff was wonderfulwow what an incredible place the food is fabulous and the staff friendly friday night there are extended hours with a bistro menu and drink specials seating is inside or outside and there is a wonderful bakery next door so you can get fresh baked goods to bring home after i will be going backat long last i dont have to drive to the southside of tucson for authentic mexican food great service decent menu   definitely worth a visitthis is a great beer distributor prices are very reasonable they dont overcharge you as the distributors in philly i actually pay 1000 less for a case of beer than what ive paid at the beer distributor in my neighborhood i havent gone anywhere else since they openedi lived here for 5 yrs this is the best breakfast ive ever had in tucson the service was awesome toothis place is a treasure it took me a while to figure out but now i shop there all the time the baked goods are amazing  especially the brownies never had better brownies than theirs theyve got a lot of the southern classics here like cocacola cake and chess pie my boyfriend loves the ham salad which i didnt even know existed before we started coming here  theyve got an excellent produce section with decent prices and racks of brand name breadsrolls marked down to 79 cents that arent even close to dayold theyve got a lunch counter that has a great menu the people that run the place are really nice forget about whole foods and harris teeter give this place a chance  it really deserves itwe walked here from napoleon and st charles after dinner one night the crowd was light and the staff was very friendly we had a scoop of creole cream cheese and a scoop of red velvetit was amazing the thai basil coconut was also really delicious and really refreshing this place is greati look forward to visiting on our next tripim still a bit in awe of the experience my wife and i had at livery yesterday evening and am trying to think through how to succinctly cover everything i want to share  but simply put it was incredible  context it was our golden anniversary last night 6 years on the 6th we had just briefly met exec chef casey frank at an event this last thursday and decided to celebrate at livery as wed been meaning to stop by for awhile now it seems he must have 1 seen us come in 2 recognized who we were from the event and 3 remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night  because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees the server came back out and informed us we should forget about your order and wait for the experience chef had lined up for us  what followed was an astounding 8course small plate journey with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles weve encountered in indianapolis chef casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time we felt like nothing short of royalty at 630pm on a sunday   food ill highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel  sweet plantains were culinary genius sweetness of the plantain saltiness of black bean puree spice from the habanero guajillo sauce and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced the combinations were so complex but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish  pork tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor slight char on the outside gave it smoke which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce  scallop was the most wellprepared ive had in a long time perfect goldenbrown sear on the outside and so tender with not one bite of grit a feat that in my book is quite an accomplishment served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine churros were a playful and wellexecuted nod to latin street fare crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made inhouse   service our server tommy was a delight from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast friendly knowledgeable and attentive he engaged my wife and i just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order while giving us privacy to enjoy each others company we very much enjoyed his service  i honestly dont know what we did to deserve such a gift but sincere and heartfelt thanks  to chef casey tommy and livery  for making our golden anniversary so very special my only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite we will certainly be coming back and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an indy restaurantauthentic food great flavored great staff great portions the lamb riblets were cooked to perfection in olive oil and lemon juice of course easily the best lamb ive had anywhereincluding astoria ny the saganaki horta skordalia horiatiki greek saladdessert it was all top notch whether you are greek or not dont miss hellas you wont be disappointedgreat place to grab a light snack like a specialty donut or slider or hangout and chat over a coffee  they do not serve alcohol however you can purchase a beer next door at steins deli and bring it over i had  chunky monkey donut cheeseburger slider fried chicken slider the snacks were all very well prepared and tasty  the cheeseburger was surprisingly juicy and the chicken slider had a nice jalapeo kick  would definitely recommend for a fast casual experiencegreat surprise below we drove home to san diego we bought another pizza to eat the next day at home great fresh toppings our favorite pizza place as of right nownever disappointed at maynards outstanding arizona wines the celery bisque and bistro salad made for excellent appetizers as main dishes we had trout and swordfish respectively the fish was exquisitely prepared leaving its inherent flavor come through not smothering it in sides to top it off an outstanding peach budino attentive prompt service great experiencegreat little wine bar with an excellent patio for enjoying live music came to see casey reeves play music here and really enjoyed it nice wine selection plenty of beer and spirits as well no food but a casual italian place shares the patio several other solid food options within walking distance bob has a nice place in a fun part of this small towns downtown keep up the good workan upscale mexican joint really i enjoy good authentic mexican food this is by far the most upscale ive seen  im more of the food trucks and hole in the walls type so this was different than what im used to   the atmosphere at besito is tough to beat they have merengue  salsa on the background which doesnt really go with the mexican theme but whos paying attention an ideal date night atmosphere for sure   food here is fantastic a little pricey but you get your moneys worth you have the 3 valet outside great service waiters have always been friendly and happy to discuss the menu besito more than met our expectations   if you love mexican food and feel like taking it to another level for once besito is your place its a gourmet mexican restaurant certainly worth tryingcame across this place with my friends visiting reno we were not disappointed what so ever we walked in around 900 and were seating immediately the server megan  was really fast and nice the breakfast menu has a great variety they have vegan and gluten free options if you prefer i order the french toast with a side order of their chicken sausage the portion size was larger than i expected and very affordable i think my plate was around 810 because i added the sausages the french toast is probably the best french toast that i have ever tasted so if you love french toast you will defiantly not be disappointedi would give them 6 stars if i could we had a fantastic time at this restaurant we used the yelp skip the line option which out us ahead of a lot of other people who probably did a walkin we were seated less than 15 minutes after our yelp suggested arrival time our server joe was the sweetest gentleman we ordered bloody mary mimosa and a baileys irish coffee for drinks all amazing the bloody mary basically came with an appetizer on top hah we ordered the breakfast sandwich and baked breakfast sandwich for our meals the portions were huge but so delicious the hashbrowns were better than the ones at waho and if you know me you know my love for waho hashbrowns the grits were way better than flying biscuits grits and thats saying something overall amazing place for brunch and fantastic serviceive always loved wawa  before any trip or event i would go to wawa they always have what i need their food is always fresh and it is made quickly this wawa is right around the corner and it has all of those  qualities the gas station can get crowded at times thats because the prices  in my opinion are on the lower side there is pleanty of space in the parking lot to make it easy to get arounda great feature about this wawa is the free airexcellent breakfast fare i have been there twice and i am hooked i tried their new omelette with mozzarella cheese and the salmon beni both were great   my only recommendation to the owners is to get an espresso machine and add espresso based drinks to their menu that should be an easy addition and would really complement their offerings very wellwow wowjust wow  so after a year of dying to come here i finally made it  my girlfriend treated me for my birthday  we made reservations for 2 at 6pm on a wednesday night  this place is byob so bring your wine  the place is super tiny so be prepared for that  this isnt your standard italian place by any stretch  there are only roughly 12 tables here which im sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner  the wait staff were pretty darn good  they worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing  we never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us  we decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimpbeans appetizer  the antipasto was amazing almost everything on it was unique and flavorful  my girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula  i loved the roasted red peppers frittada and asparagus  the shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant  well worth it in my opinion  for our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu  we went with the spinach gnocchi tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese  all were extremely unique  ive never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience  the tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine  i loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well  they are also pretty liberal with their bread here so order away  the tomato pie focaccia was amazing  the other bread was on par as well  we ended our night with some zeppolies  they were warm and fresh  the nutella sauce was a great modern twist  a perfect ending to a perfect meal  the place can be a bit on the high side but i think its totally worth it  this is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for 20 at chilis  on an ending note with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud  the table next to us had about 6 people and were dominating the noise space of the entire dining area  it was quite obnoxious but it was tolerableonly because of the food  am i going back do you have to askbombcom i forget what i ordered but it was similar to a cuban sandwich on donut bread my friend ordered a cinnamon sugar donut while she waited for her actual food and that was delicious i ate everything because it was amazing and deserves all the hype it has received i need to go back and try those stuffed donutsa local told us about this nice coffee house on our first day in nola its nice and clean the guy behind the counter was nice and the iced mocha latte was great if your looking for great inexpensive coffee this is the placegreatest hash browns ever  get a slice i pepper jack on them   good coffee  eggs florentine is mind blowing too  fast and friendly servicewe had lunch at the brewers cabinet which was great but then we needed some coffee after our long lunch so we asked our bartender and she directed us to the nearby coffeebar she told me about the lavender latte which i thought sounded interesting so i tried one on ice and it was so good i love the vibe of the place too very beautiful and great service cant wait to go backwonderful amazing awesome convenience store best soft pretzels great sandwiches breakfast breakfast burritos chicken finger bowls over mac and cheese drinks teas lemonades i love it i wish these were in california andor new englandwent here for my birthday with a group of 11 people we got a table quick the design is super cute we walked upstairs to check out the roof top seating cant wait to sit up there for the summer i had the yuca fries as an appetizer and pork pastor for my main dish i recommend the livery margarita its really good and doesnt taste too sugary my friend surprised me with churros and they were amazing love this place will definitely return our server was awesome tooi ordered a last minute pumpkin pie for pick up the next morning and it was not a problem for them  the pie was ready when i showed up and delicious  i had forgotten about this little gem and when i walked in i wanted to buy all the treats they had on display  they were beautiful  i think their pricing is beyond fair for their quality product    just a heads up on the phone orders  you must pay over the phone not when you pick uptons of food went for a graduation party very good flavors wasabi fries are a mustgreat food and ambience the wait staff were so friendly and helpful the food where do i start one word amazing we had the traditional pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup ham eggs and has browns so goodexcellent gelato and sorbets  you need to try this  conveniently located on the way back from the beach or after a trip to the taco busmexican food in the city can be a hit or miss and its hard to find a place that serves the authentic stuff and his place nailed it went here on a friday night and brought a bottle of tequila unfortunately the free pitcher of margarita mix is only valid monday through thursday but the pitcher wasnt that expensive the empanadas and fish tacos were to die for we also got shrimp quesadillas service was great initially they brought out the wrong type of quesadillas and gave us the shrimp ones on the house  the only pitfall of this whole dining experience were the complimentary chips and salsa they were a bit mehawesome great place the staff are friendly and met all our needs very great energy each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art if you are diabetic this is a no no for you it was soooo good the owner even came out and spoke with customers she has such a beautiful spirit so happy we stopped by we couldnt even eat it all my recommendation is to sharesat outside for an early dinner before the kentucky derby we had the chicken ribs and macaroni and the brie and crab hand pie all of it was great the meat was all tasty and tender the macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper the hand pie which is new to the menu was my personal favorite you could taste the crab and it came surrounded by a well complimented creamy cocktail sauce highly suggest everything we hadive now tried quite a few of these strange donuts and all have been delicious and interesting  a few favorites the strange bacon idonut and the fritters   this isnt your typical donut shop so if youre bothered by unique ingredients friendly faces colorful decor or reviving a great neighborhood dont shop hereexcellent breakfast we asked for several changes  eggs medium bacon and hash browns extra crispy biscuits instead of toast pecan pancakes instead of plain and everything came out just as we wanted the pecan pancakes were flavorful sweet fluffy and packed with pecans our waiter was friendly and gave us great service with a smile try this out when you are in the french quarterdudes  seriously so good so so soooo good  the rutabaga fries are the most amazing thing ever  the rutabaga cheese is better than any real cheese wiz ive ever had in my life  the reuben cheesesteak may or may not have also brought a tear to my eyes  i mean  this place is amazing  thepot holes brownies holy crap we ate one before we got our food ate  left and turned around and went in and bought 2more that didnt make it back to jersey with us   dont judge me  try one youll see i wish there was more seating  but other than that theres not one bad thing to say  some of the best vegan food weve had yet  thanks wiz kidcupcakes are amazing and i love that they have a gluten free option anytime i need cupcakes i will order through here the staff was so friendly and patient with my questionsbeen eating here since the beginning best sonoran dog in town hands down the comp is overrated and his buns and ingredients arent as fresh their carne is also good and i also mess w a caramelo from time to time there is a reason rachel ray said they the second best hot dogs in the usproduce is fresh local when available and always tasty they accept credit cards which is pretty unique for most local produce markets i love that is a familyrun business and is much cheaper than the old tasteless produce that is sold at most supermarkets we have also bought vegetables and herbs for our garden heregreat goodsized sandwiches fresh closest that youll get to ny potato salad was awesome service is great will definitely be returningfriendly staff  great bagels  awesome breads and good coffee  plus a nive atmosphere  best bagels in suburban philly  love this placefirst ted drewes is more than the christmas trees that populate its parking lot from late october to december  it is frozen custard  pure sin  something that even the locals will stand on queue to eat in the dead of winter because its that damn good  people have been known to give this up for lent  and its one of the things i actually miss about st louis besides my familywe love our thai milk boba tea this place does it great theyre always adding new things toowouldnt have known this place existed if it wasnt for yelp they make very good authentic vietnamese banh mi sandwiches i can get over how little they costfinally got to check this place out on a girls night out  both of my other girls had separately gone before and i am so glad they suggested this   had a wonderful first impression  clean and modern with a friendly attentive hostess  the saxophonist was a nice plus  i prefer a little harder jazz but he was very talented and this is perfect dining music for most people and my friends and i enjoyed it very much  they informed me there is a jazz jam upstairs on sunday nights i will be there i am glad i had experienced guides with me  i probably would have chosen something else if both of my friends who had not previously gone to sylvias together had not gone on and on and on about the pork chops  i thought it would blasphemy to try something else  boy they were right  i had two pork chops so i could try both the fried and the smothered  they were both delicious and both completely different  the fried was perfectly battered not greasy at all nicely flavored and very tender  the smothered was a wonderful slowcooked fall apart piece of heaven  as it was all way too much for me to finish at one sitting i will be enjoying the smothered pork today i had the mashed potatoes and collard greens  both were excellent and hot  i asked for vinegar with my collards before tasting them but they were wonderfully flavored without it so i didnt use it  mashed potatoes with gravy were excellent  i am not a big fan of some of the sides that my friends got but everyone wanted to share so i tried the sweet potatoes excellent and the tomatoes and okra surprising good   i am not a big fan of corn bread either but they came to the table warm slightly sweet and moist  excellent   none of us had room for dessert but our friend said we had to have the sweet potato pie and ordered us all an order to go  i have another friend who raves about their peach cobbler  i cant personally report yet service was very friendly and attentive yet did not hover   as this was a friday night we went a few blocks north to hit 3 daughters have a beer and watch some live music afterwards  i love what is happening on 22nd street   will definitely come back and try some other items on the menupicking up a roast and ordering meat for christmaswe decided to have a hamburger since it was late in the day and we didnt have any lunch sarah made us one of the best hamburgers both of us had ever had so porterhouse not only has great meatsseafood but a great deli and fresh made sandwiches we love porterhouseone thing this fat woman knows is cake i dont think i can highly recommend this gem enough except to say that 12 hours later i can not stop thinking about how delicious every single thing i tried was since it was our first trip we had the minis 2 bit cupcakes the red velvet was without a doubt the best i had ever had my husband agreed light fluffy but the icing was the perfect compliment of sweetness the sugar cookie tasted exactly like one and looked like it too i also had the chocolate salted carmel with was delicious and the coconut was the lightest most delicate cake ive ever had you do not have to be a coconut lover to relish this my son a chocoholic couldnt get enough of the blackout but said the peanut butter chocolate was just ok   we also loved the atmosphere and that it was incredibly dog friendly i loved the paper straws they even sell pupcakes minis just for dogs our server was incredibly knowledgable and friendly  my only areas that that i can suggest for improvement is that it would be nice to see a list of exactly which minis are available without getting up and looking or asking your server some sell out and the iced tea was a lavendar earl gray which i found a little too lavender we will definitely be going backthe only thing i love more than their coffee are the baristas that work here its a quiet good place to read a book and enjoy a multitude of drinks they offeri am surprised this place doesnt have better reviews  i have found the people to be very nice  the meatseafood department is excellent  i live in nearby mt airy and come here a lot to get meat to grill  we also frequently take advantage of the meal of the week which typically has an entre side and desert for a very good price  they will have all the elements together and there is a recipe card you can pick up  the bakery is also very good  i agree with the commenters that the produce selection is pretty bad  this does not bother me however because we have a ton of good options for produce in the area  we have 2 weavers ways an produce in germantown and produce junction in glenside  for everything but produce i find myself coming to the fresh market a lot  i find the parking lot to be very convenient  with the layout of the store i can zip in and out very quickly  i have also never had to wait in a long line which i appreciateive spent an unmentionable amount of money at the flying cupcake bakery because the cupcakes are just that good  if you are going for the first time make sure to pick up at red velvet elvis  it might be my favorite cupcake in the entire world and ive been to the petite cafe home of the stuffed cupcake in njamazing we drove 25hrs just to try this place it was delicious with courteous fast service will definitely visit again loved the cheese grits omelet and sweet potato pancakes my husband couldnt say e ought about thosecame to stl for a wedding and was lucky enough to have my air b and b above this amazing bbq joint they have a smoker outside that is cooking all day making the surrounding area smell heavenly i order the fried korean ribs which had a nice smokey flavor we also tried the fried cat fish we ordered spicy and theyre not messing around  cooked perfectly with a corn meal breading the fried green tomatoes were nice and had a tangy sauce on the side do yourself a favor and get some moonshine as wellexcellent venue for a quick lunch ny style pizza accompanied by a delicious fresh salad  they offer daily weekday specials  the best part is sitting out on the shady patiotry the bouquet tea tonics  theyre delicious the mochas are also very yummy and the artwork on top of the mocha is cool the lavender latte was awesome too if youre in reno dont miss ityou must go here for breakfast short line and we arrived at 830 when we left at 945 the line was around the building santa fe and peach pancakes were amazingim always amazed when i can just roll by this place in my car and gaze longingly in the window  but most of the time  theres no resisting  try the cherry cream cheese donut chocolate donut chockfull of white cream i should just rub them on my thighs and bypass the whole digestion thing because thats where theyre gonna end up get the picture  goi absolutely love this great spot  it is so hard to find real healthy food in the areaa lot of other restaurants claim they are healthy but greasy and loaded with garbage  the staff is pleasant and helpful anytime i have a question about a particular menu item  keep up the good work boysalways a great experience when i stop in the darkness croissant and the morning bun are my favorites but i always love trying something new each visiti have lived in 3 majors cities across the us 2 foreign countries and although i have only been to pp twice it is hands down the best pancake i have ever had sorry mom  and you dont even have to get the crazy sweet potato or buckwheat stylings to get something special just get regular old buttermilk they are perfect they are the pancake ideal  i was here for the first time about 5 years ago it was amazing i just went back for the second time the memory of my first visit in my mind and i was just praying it was as good as id remembered it waswhen i visited downtown santa barbara i enjoyed the original location so much that i decided to stop by the second location later that evening  this location is far more spacious and still preserves the whimsy and artsy atmosphere i liked in the first location i ordered the magic bowl and it was absolutely amazing the baristas were also very courteous  i think this spot is more ideal for doing work or studying on a nice afternoon just a few blocks away from state st it is a bit quieter and less crowded its a bit strange that the two locations would be so close to one another but my guess is that they cater to slightly different crowds studiers vs shoppers so ill take itfinding a place where i can take my daughter whose is gluten and dairy intolerant and a vegetarian and picky as hell is impossible these guys make the impossible possible she was thrilled and everything i ate was fantastic for those nonvegetarian nongluten free and nondairy free youll love it   i had biscuits and gravy with a side of pork sausage you must try this one of the best biscuits and gravy i have ever had   the owners are a truly nice couple go out of your way to eat here its worth itambiencevery comfortable day or night just a lovely delicious cup of coffee served in a   cup and saucer lovely its so much more enjoyable this way and the regular size is quite generous  dont come here if youd prefer to pay a fortune for a coffee drink with a name you cant pronounce and then sit at a table to drink it from a paper cup this place makes you feel welcome to sit and take your time at a table looking out through the large glass front at the crepe myrtle tree lined sidewalk and little globe lights on the front patio  its simply my favorite place in new orleans to get my coffee zen on oh and they do great breakfast and lunch paninigreat addition to the lansdale bar scene great beer and great food awesome servers and bartenders say hi to gm joethis will change your life i absolutely enjoyed my snoball and i am itching to return hooked stuffed cheesecake is the bestyou can smell the deliciousness in the air as you approach rons caribbean cuisinetheir platters are huge i felt like i was in an episode of man vs foodthe chicken curry is slamminits nice to see thais style ice cream here in tampa its worth the wait just dont come during the peak time located  near usfs campus and the price is pretty okay i will be backgreat little family joint  shrimp oyster and crawfish all deliciousbig fan of this place they have the best sugar cookies and butter cake although the butter cake starts getting stale within hours so eat it fast they are always so nice gave a cookie to my daughter today while we waited in line most importantly i just leaned they make breakfast sandwiches on fridays saturdays and sundays they are excellent and come with western potatoes and a croissant you can see one half of a breakfast sandwich in my picture all of this for just 699 a very good value considering their normal bakery items are a bit expensive  but worth itbusy but quick and fast service with deliciously thick custard  i had the turtle and it was everything i thought it would be sweet smooth with a bit of crunch  this place is a st louis staplei cant say enough about ice cream 504 the only bad thing is its with in walking distance and were finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream the flavors are spot on  id add a picture but its always eaten before i get a chance a must stop if your in the areaeverything you want to eat and drink is here  the wine section is extensive  a trip to the cheese room is heavenly  the prepared foods are delicious  the marinara sauce is to die for  they have hoagies and paninis made to order   visit the coffee bar for some serious brews  the gelato looks and tastes very close to the real deal in italy    they have a covered outside seating area that is cozy yet spacious  you can even go grocery shopping here    what is not to like about this place  if you like italian food you owe it to yourself to check this place outtasty food culvers never disappoints everything ive had has been really good from their food to their cement mixers i also really like their shakes super yummy store is always clean and employees are really nicelet me start by saying i cant wait to go back to amfm for technically being in a food court in the farmers marker arnold myint sure did step it up he has created a casual yet upscale counter restaurant in a food court bravo   i ordered half of a turkey sandwich and a side of the chick pea and feta salad everything was extremely fresh which i would hope for being in the farmers market if you choose to eat at their counter which we did you get a real place setting not a recycled paper box its like you are eating at a nice restaurant but paying the same price you would pay at come crappy fastfood joint   the service was great they kept asking us if we were enjoying our meals they even gave us a taste of their mexican chocolate  coconut brownie which by the way was delicious   i could be considered a geek by some because of how fascinated i am with new innovate technology so needless to say i was more than excited when the waiter sat an ipad in front of me the screen showed a breakdown of all the food we ordered and you just swipe your card to pay then they textemail your receipt to you how cool is that  so for a fresh delicious meal under ten bucks head down to the farmers market and check out amfmgot some delicious dinner from here and it was just as good as the other chipotles ive been to i got a vegan burrito bowl with a side of corn tortillas it was very goodthe hazelnut sponge cake is the best around def worth the price and its always freshthis was the first time weve been to this location and it is pretty cool they have plenty of area to sit and relax and of course the coffee and food selection is on pointdecided to try this out for a late morning sunday brunch option  tried the classic breakfast a nest egg and a hand squeezed oj  firstly  super excited about housemade biscuits  its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this  gravy was tasty but could have used a little more  now in all fairness i treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment so for normal folk you may find the gravy quantity acceptable  i went with bacon which was really good  thick slices nice and crispy  and my eggs were cooked perfectly to order  i really liked the crispy potatoes as well  two small whole potatoes well seasoned and seared on the outside  the oj was fresh and tasty  not too tart   my friend had the nest egg  she thought it was really tasty but since i didnt try it i dont have much to say about that   i think the food is excellent  i will agree with other reviews  not a fan of the community seating  we didnt have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal you dont really have the privacy or the space to do that here  i am hoping the excellent food results in more seatingthe food is excellent you order at the counter and then go sit down they bring you your good and they are fast my fiance order the chicken gyro and i order the beef kabob  the plates are hugeim almost thankful that there is usually a line for this place  if there was not i would eat here daily and become obese  ive only been here once but my friend and i tried 4 different kinds of pancakes  we had banana bread probably our favorite the famous sweet potato raspberry and chocolate chip  all of them were awesome we also felt the need to eat potatoes and bacon because night shifters are ravenous when they get off work in the morning  just take everyones word for it and eat here and then take the rest of the day off to recuperate from your food comaa group of 9 met for lunch august 26 hs friends we were relegated to a back room with no one around that was a good thing we had our own private room and we did a lot of laughing and a lot of talking  trish was our incredible server and she had another server at her shoulder he was always smiling and he helped a lot  i made the reservation specifying that we needed separate checks and that i was paying for the man of celebrations meal i doubleclarified both points with trish she got it and she was unfazed these people have nerves of steel  it went like clockwork they got in cadence with our program we were slow steady and smooth  a lot of salads were ordered and enjoyed  i got a cheeseburger cheddar no bun double pickles tomato lettuce and onion southern green beans as a side i dont know whats so southern about these green beans but they were flatter and longer and bacon was involved bingo  an incredibly juicy medium cheeseburger    really good beef flavor tender i want another one  trish took pictures of our group which are now on facebook  i took half my burger home and i drank 17 glasses of water gol i had to drive home come onstopped by here for a coffee break and the reviews did not disappoint the service was awesome i changed my drink order and they didnt even sweat it they have these delish cookies you have to try called the smore rocher so yummy that i ended up buying all of them i ordered the matcha latte and looks do not deceive a must go chill spot away from the crowdjust a little followup  the mrs and i ate there last friday night and the live entertainment was really good considering the tiny space they had to squeeze into  we ran into some people we know in the music biz and she agreed the guitar player was terrific    the food was great once again although i must admit i always order the same exact thingthe hummus envy was so good i chose the jalapeo cilantro hummus and the garlic hummus the servings are huge and the severs are very friendlyi was a little hesitant at first based solely on the name thinking i was getting americanized mexican food but luckily i was wrong   the business is family owned and operated and its honestly the best taco place ive found my coworker and i literally drive passed 3 other well known taco places just to come here for lunch  my go to used to be the xtreme grilled fish tacos but the owner suggested trying them tijuana style and i havent gone back you really taste the quality of the fish with the tijuana tacos that plus the cilantro purple onion and whatever sauce it is magic   everyone i have brought here loves it and goes back i would highly recommend them   only tip call ahead they get busy for lunch and calling ahead really cuts down your wait time   sorry theres no picture attached my tacos were eaten before i could take the picturemy group really enjoyed our culinary history tour with bob he was entertaining honest and gave us some really great pointers about where to go in the city i was pleased with the great balance of delicious food and interesting trivia we were served on the tour i would highly recommend iti almost dont want to rate this restaurant 5 staronly because im selfish and want to keep this place under the radar  ive not had one thing on the menu that wasnt delicious and ive eaten here at least 68 times in the last 3 weeks   steaks are delicious and if you like pasta try the tuscan gravy w homemade fettuccine if youve had breakfast at their beach location you find some of the same items but some prepared differently from the beach spot  i had the sausage gravy and biscuit it was probably the best i have ever eaten my companion ordered the lox eggs benedict and loved them  happy hour 26 everyday with drink and app specials i love the thai chicken flatbread  there is outdoor seating and two indoor dining areas great ambiance and the service is quite good as well the drinks are generous and delicious  parking can be a bit tricky nut go around the corner and theres parking behind and a back entrance enjoy and i might see you theregreat place like the loud energy and crowd here as far as burgers go this is one of the best ive had im stl  i got the patty melt with chilli cheese fries both great although i wish the cheese on the fries were real cheese not cheese sauce  also tried the 3 chilli chocolate shake spicyi love simone and her french boutique themed bakery my moms birthday cake last year was wonderful i drop in often for croissants macaroons and other sweet treats at least once a week weekend tea parties are amazing but reservations are needed they also have additional all age events that occur monthly its such a fun posh family oriented business once you get s cake from here youll never go to sams costco or schnucks ever againi absolutely love this place  every time i have gone here i have received yummy food and excellent service cant say it any plainer than that    best tomatoes i have ever tasted well outside of those from my grandmothers garden yummy crab cakes and a great assortment of wine white sangria is my current fave  would be a great place to assemble a gift basket of local stuff for a friend or relativewow  this bakery is a must if you are in the st louis area great location humble yet inspired recycled decor and the best sweets i have come across in a very long time on our order1 popcorn cookiemost moist buttery popcorny cookie you ever haddelicious 2 salted caramel cupcakeomgaahhhhamazing 3 browniea small crunchiness on the outside and ooeeyy gooey chocolatyness on the inside that will leave you comparing it to any other browning you ever had and then you realize there is no comparisonjust superb 4 boston creme whoopie piesooo yummy and deliciously put together 5 a box of french macaroons made by a friend and sold in the bakery 6 varieties in a boxheavenlywe ended up making this a community box where we all got one bite of each macaroon the lavendar and orange ginger were my favorites too wonderful to not sharewe decide to make it a once a year trip at least from the orlando area this place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through dont let it its well organized just decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top we bought 56 cheeses  a couple of dry meats and a bottle of cannonau wine enjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella buy sfogliatelle before they are gone they run out in less than 12 hours so worth itthey should have a frequent buyers card because we spend a fortune here when we are in italy we eat gelato every day and frost gelato is very close in taste and texture i would like to see some new exotic flavors but my favorites are sea salt caramel stratchitella mint chocolate chip black cherry and at christmas peppermint love the peppermint  and of course coconut yum  they do a great job with service presentation and of course tasteomg this place is amazing all of the food taste so fresh and organic im so full i had the deluxe scramble and it was probably one of the best scrambles i have ever had the waitress is extremely friendly and welcoming its a nice small place with delicious food and extremely affordable i will definitely visit again when in townim a big fan of tbar  i mean really how can you not like a place that offers 50 different kinds of loose tea  and thats not even counting the speciality drinks fizzes or boba pearls in the tbar lexicon  it was also nice to attend the yelp office hours with carrie and the gang last night what a great idea to get to spend a few relaxing hours with some of phillys finest  what do i normally get when i go to tbar  it really depends on the weather  if its warm outside i prefer the awake or gin fizz  these are herbal tea blends infused with fruit juice and mixed with sparkling water  very refreshing and tasty  if its cold outside i prefer to get a loose tea blend like midnight blue or classic oolong teas  if you feel overwhelmed by the choices and blends  ask the staff they are very knowledgeable and extremely friendlyi recently organized a trivia night for the nonprofit invest stl at urban eats having a trivia night at ue was extremely easy since we had access to the staff full kitchen and the bar  caya the coowner was very easy to work with and she accommodated our needs and made the event run smoothly we offered apps and a drink with our ticket price and guest were also able to order beer and food from the full menu it worked out well because we were able to raise funds and she was able to bring in business as well there are various spaces availabe including a loft event space upstairs for larger events the quality of food atmosphere and service were great i couldnt ask for moreeverything is amazing here as always the mole is out of control you can taste the cinnamon the toasted sesame seeds and the chocolate coming thruthe habit is my weekly habit i love this place they are fast inexpensive and delicious i could eat here everyday of the week and not get tired of it teriyaki burger is the  greatest thing inventedive been to new orleans several times but this time i was looking for a different kind of dessert type of treat aside from the goto beignets so i found this spot on yelp they had 810 flavors to choose from so we got 4 of them praline bacon raspberry white chocolate pineapple upside down and cookies and milk praline bacon was the 1st one we tried and it was a tough act to follow it was a flavor party where sweet savory and yummy had me dancing the pineapple upside donut was good the raspberry was my least favorite however the cookies and milk pulled up the rear and made the wait worth it overall the donuts are great and whatever batter they use for the actual donut is really tasty i will be back for some donuts and sliders next timeive eaten at many indian places  this one is very good  i felt extremely guilty and very happy with the lunch buffet  it was wonderful  their vegetable dishes were top notch and the chicken tikka masala was some of the best ive ever had  also would give high marks for the onion chutney and palak paneer  id eat here often if i was localthis was such a wonderful time and i have told dozens of my friends read on  i received the tickets for the double happiness sushi  dim sum class as a birthday gift we got there early get there early and we were wonderfully surprised that it was just us and one other couple so we had lots of handon training  first we were shown the kitchen and chef poon told us lots of stories chef poon is fascinating and if you take the effort to really listen to him hes quite entertaining his sous chef was a pleasure to talk to too  then we learned how to make the dumplings i had no idea there were so many kinds we made quite a few and he allowed me to fry a batch yum really very tasty  then it was sushi time  we stood at the table and made tons of such all kinds a seaweed cone with caviar rice on the inside rice on the outside with trays and trays of fish shrimp vegetable and more  and were eating as we are making them still we had so much food left over i took home five trays of amazing sushi so much that when i brought them to my moms the next day we still couldnt finish them  so we started packing up the food and chef poon motions us to a table where he prepared dinner steak general joes chicken yum a tasty salad and our dumplings  truly it was so delicious but i needed to bring it home i was stuffed i had it on monday and it was extraordinary  then because it was my birthday he brought out a cake that he bought for me i mean that was so nice thanks chef    that said for 120 a person you get a lot entertainment two classes and a ton of food  i read some of the 1star reviews and they are nitpicking on some things the price of the fish compared to the price of the class thats just silly youre paying for worldclass knowledge and fun  the class was well worth the money i was entertained fed and had lots of food to take home  i highly recommend chef poons classesthe wings are so meaty and juicy always friendly courteous and prompt the beer was ice cold perfect dinnerstaff makes this place i am here now i really love this place great pizza great atmosphere great staff this place is the best havent tried it need toa great way to enter the 4th of july weekend with brunch at prep and pastry the quality of food and pastry are excellent great vibe and place to be all year round a great find in the old pueblothe food here was simply put amazing i came here with three other people and we were able to get a reservation just a few hours beforehand although it was a very cold night so maybe it was an unpopular night for that reason im pretty picky about sushi and my boyfriend is even pickier and we both loved it the rock shrimp tempura was outstandingly fresh with a mild wasabi sauce and meltinyourmouth shrimp the izumi roll scallops and sashimi sampler were all great although ive had slightly better tuna at other restaurants dont skip dessert here the un donut dessert was unexpectedly deliciousalmost like a cider donut served fresh hot and crispy on the outside soft in the middle considering the portion sizes you get in a typical sushi restaurant i thought they were quite generous the veggie tempura is a meal in itself  it was a slow night at the restaurant and service was a bit slow i think there was only one waiter so i could see how that could be a problem when they are very busy but it wasnt enough of an issue to knock a star offabsolutely the greatest ice cream that i have ever had went on an extremely busy night but the employees remained friendly and were prompt with the service we ended up getting the four mini scoops which was enough to share we tried the cookie monster creole cream cheese i scream fudge and the cafe au lait there were all incredible and accurately represented the area fair prices and unbelievable flavors looking forward to coming back to try different flavors againive eaten at this location countless times and it is always perfect awesome food awesome beer awesome service what more can you ask for  particularly love the outdoor seatinggreat food at a great value my favorite items on the menu are the pho pork bun bahn mi and the pot stickers are deliciousthe bahn mi comes on true french bread i recommend the pork belly as for pho i usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts pork bun is my favorite menu item it comes with vermicelli noodles cucumber carrots and more the best server there her name is tim ask for her if you want to get the best serviceback a year later for more birthday ice cream martinis i forgot our servers name  but he was excellent and made the night so fun the tuscan bean soup was delicious and the martinis were spot on got the chocolate framboise and then they whipped me up a cake flavored one on request completed the night with a tiny glass of ice cream with a candle i think this will be an annual tradition livery is awesome  exactly what indy needed thank you cunningham restaurant groupwe were extremely pleased with our omelets simple honest and tasty food the concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant for a healthfood type of breakfast per my request i wish i were staying longer so i could try pancakesi adore inn out burgers  get them animal style or try them in a lettuce wrap protein style  theyve got a special menu not listed httpwwwinnoutcom and their fries are amazing  you can actually taste the potato in them  their menu is very basic but its all you need  burgers fries and shakes4star beer 5star ambiance this is the most impressive and promising brewery in santa barbara   inside they have a high ceiling exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list it looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like ibus abv style volume poured the list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours berliners stouts pilsners and ipas  they offer very nice tasting flights which our group did you grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try this system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process  a great idea the beer quality was a bit all over the place which is expected from a new brewery however some showed a lot of promise and i think third window has what it takes to improve their recipes detailed notes are below i ended up liking their pilsner the light the best and got it in a large format mug pour   pretzels and popcorn are available which is a nice touch dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well    extra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery  the light 11 this was an outstanding german style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated the flavor was dry and a tad powdery but the finish was neutral and refreshing this was my absolute favorite of the beers i tried so i got a large pour in a giant mug   brett saison looking beautiful in the glass glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation the aroma is sawdust barn candied mango the flavor is bubbly neautral and very dry but not abrasive refreshing though a tad washed out in the flavor  rakau welch looking identical to the brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits lemongrass dill fennel oregano  super herbal the flavor is dry neutral refreshing the farmyard character of saison is spot on here simple dry but not abrasive  xexo super dry for an ipa that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive needed some work   the ko bomb inky black in color but much too thin a body for stout the nose is savory chocolate mousse big raisin chocolate covered raisin but the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda grape cough syrup and tootsie roll  executioners daughter clear amber in color this one had intense vinegar acetic acid and nail polish remover ethyl acetate in the nose taste is very nice however with cinnamon mild sugar dark bread banana nut bran muffin great mouthfeel  the origin 2016 this was billed as a dryhopped apa but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch the flavor was watery and bland overall it seemed dead and not what was intendedfantastic service and the food also great simple tasty and well pricedthere is no better thai food in the tampa bay area  this is authentic thai food not your typical not too spicy please bland thai food made for americans although you can decide how spicy or not you want your dish fresh delicious food at reasonable prices the yum nua beef salad is one of my favorites tender slices of grilled beef cucumbers scallions purple onion over greens with a light lime dressing other favorites include panang chicken beef or shrimp papaya salad chicken satay fried rolls thai sausage pork larb if i ever won the lottery i would hire the cook shes is the bestgreat place to grab amazing sliders cheese fries and wonderful donuts i had a blt sliderpork heaven cheese fries are a must  comes with friends that like to share because it is too hard to pick just one donutthe best icecream on this side of heaven i love this place the icecream here is soo flavorfull whew new orleans has the best of the best even when it comes to icecream  one u come here for icecream youll forget about baskin robins and cold stone sorry not sorry lol enjoywhen you absolutely have to satisfy your sweet tooth this is the first place you should consider no matter which cake you chooseyou have chosen wisely a friendly staff will let you sample whatever your eyes are set oni had my co worker pick up a to go order the food was all fabulous  i thought it was pricey until i saw the quality and amount of food that you get the coleslaw is unique and delicious if you havent tried this place go i cant wait to try the cajun meatloaf available after 5 pm great job jungle prada tavern team i will be backthis is seriously one of the best farmers markets ive been to between and including san francisco and san diego you can get almost anything here  from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and youll start to get an idea of whats what here all this and mas at totally reasonable prices too i recommend trying out a cherimoya if youve never had one  its a real treat  for more info on the weekly schedule check out the website  the one on saturday is on the corner of santa barbara and cota streets and it goes from 830 to 1230 even though its pretty bustling parking wasnt a problemi love this crazy chicken  probably the cleanest freshest and friendliest location i have been too in reno  customers are usually interesting species  but even when its busy and annoying they handle it very wellby far the best cinnamon roll ive had in life make sure to get it heated because they heat it cream brle style and thats the best partjambalaya gator sausage and beignets are phenomenal  we just cant find jambalaya this good for miles and miles around  thrilled to have them hereim not into beer so i cant speak for their product but i had a very good lunch there one weekend my friends pizza order got mixed up and our wonderful server took a few bucks off even though the pizza was still deliciousso yummy with so many flavors we got here 5 minutes before it closed and there was a huge line we got to stay past 10 thankfully the toppings are 50 cents extra each kind of rediculous but she put on a ton of sprinkles soooo that made up for the extra cost  the ice cream is really good and the whole place smells amazing i highly recommendwent on a googleyelp search  i had been to the italian market a few times and did not know that it existed  all i can say is where have you been all my life   ordered a couple of pounds of broccoli rabe sausage and 4 aged strips  my sons were raised on top end places for steak and asked me to go back for their birthday dinners well i am on my way today to pick up a few large steaks for the q  not cheap  but as with most things in life you get what you pay for  i will be standing in the snow cooking tonighti was in town for business and after checking into my hotel i searched for the closest bbq place i wasnt sure what id find at hendricks but i was pleasantly surprised as i was driving through the neighborhood i liked the small town feel since i was by myself i had planned on taking it to go and eating at the hotel but after walking inside i had to stay to enjoy the decor light bulbs in mason jars flat screen tvs and an amazing lighted patio although the view is just a parking lot its too bad it wasnt closer to the river behind it or had something else to look at   i ordered pork steak which ive never heard of before and it was really good it looked like a tbone but was tender enough to be cut with a fork for my sides i chose collard greens and cole slaw the cole slaw was awesome i have a weird ritual where i always order the cole slaw at different places to see how they make it this one is definitely in my top 5 the slaw was finely chopped and had ground pepper in it which i love i usually put black pepper in my slaw anyways but this one was perfect cold and with a kick collard greens with a bit of bacon in it was good too if i had more time or with a group of friends id definitely come back because everything looked comfortably countryhands down favorite sub place around the atmosphere is fun with the fire fighter theme they totally roll with it from the table decor to the names of the subs who doesnt love a hot sub they are by far more unique than subway or jimmy johns or any other sub place they dont have many bread options but the toppings and wide selection of hot sauces makes up for that talk about flavor i love the sub machine with the over 120 drink options but with only one machine it takes forever to get your drink but at least you can make it special every time i go here its packed the customer service is great i love that they walk your meal to you its better than standing around or having a pager they also do boxed lunches or catering which is always a great addition to any partyi love the bartenders so sweet and so charming  brielle by far is the best so sociable and very charismatic i always try to grab a beer when she is around bubble tea is probably the only sweet thing in life that i absolutely have to have and while this place is a bit out of the way i go here quite often to get my fix the flavors are damn good despite being powdered mixes cleanliness is a decor is cute and bright i was so stoked that they didnt just have basic fruit flavors but also taro red bean jasmine et cetera much more authentic in terms of product and taro is my shit so good they have traditional tapioca and bursting boba with fruity flavors its also in a strip mall with a really really good asian restaurant next door cantonese and by cirillas kill two birds with one stone right kidding sort of i havent tried anything else here but friends have all raved about everything from the froyo to the boba so id definitely say its a solid place overall   only complaint would be do not go during rush hour holy shit i live in broad ripple and it took over an hour to get there i mean rush hour is necessary evil but this is terrible completely my fault for not paying attention to the time but wow that is an incredibly nervewrecking experience under those circumstances just avoid the minivan suburban 500pm rush and youll be finei love this super cute super delicious pie shop  kelly the owner makes delicious pies from scratch including the famed sugar cream  which i had today for the very first time and was blown away by how good it was  theyve got coffee and tea and other little goodies to buy and cute tables inside and out where you can sit and enjoy your little slice of heaven or just buy a whole pie already to go and take it home to enjoy this place rules  anywhere that you can get a shot of booze in your hot chocolate is a winner for me  the coconut ice cream i have had in the past has tasted more like vanilla ice cream with coconut flavoring this was not the case here  chock full of coconut it was some of the best ice cream i have ever had  the whipped cream was dense and delicious and along with the hot fudge this place put forth one of the best ice cream experiences to date  the decor doesnt feel like your run of the mill diner and was excellent  i would like to go back here sometime and grab something to eat but i will certainly be making it something small so i can end big with another sundaewow had 2 pieces of the sock eyed salmon broiled and cooked to perfection also got the dry broiled scallops with garlic butter which were amazingthe price was as advertised the service was top notch and the room was better than expected located right next to bourbon street and the absinthe house i will definitely stay here againdelish one of my favorite sb pizza joints yummy thin crust great toppings and great variety on the menu just wish it wasnt in the mallmy favorite coffee shop in tampa all of their flavored lattes are delicious they also have bagels muffins  glutenfree banana bread pumpkin bread for today and homemade cakesmazzaro must be an italian word for we

9am230pm saturday closed sundayvisiting from out of town went to the florida aquarium and found this place after fantastic pizza  great service if you like nystyle pizza definitely give them try theawesome wings we had the braised beef tacos chile coconut wings and the pretzels everything was great the beer variety is great tooi enjoy cooking and md market is one of the top oriental markets around i have shopped most all places in the area always clean fresh produce  meats and seafood staff has always been helpful and i can say i have found things great overallvery much enjoyed this meal the restaurant is nice and spacious great views and on golf course   the appetizers were good not great we got the pullaway rolls which were very nice when they came out warm the spinach artichoke dip was also good a little different than you get at most places   the burger was excellent i built my own with pretzel bun bacon onions and mushrooms the fries and the onion rings were terrific   the cookie skillet was a very nice ending great cookie it was my birthday and the server took a polaroid and gave it to us in a nice card it was a nice touchbest popcorn i have ever had i go up to new hope a few times a month i found this gem back in july and have never been disappointed you wont be either staff and owners are pretty awesome toobest steak sandwich in town  best hummus plate in town  best cubano i have ever tastedand all in a great atmosphere and smiling faces  this place deserves nothing less than five starsbusy location slow stuff clean and always well stocked good drinks they cold be a little faster but i still love starbucks this place dang they make some delicious donuts thats for sure i stopped in on a few occasions during my week long visit to nola only to their mag st location each time i visited the line was somewhat longer than what i had hoped although the line went by very quickly i waited 15 minutes or so tops on a super busy day i cant really complain there a few people in my party made a comment about how they should have a separate donut togo window for people just wanting to get a quick donut or two to go what a brilliant idea  per their name they obviously serve items other than donuts they have breakfast items about 5 or 6 to choose from till 11am at 11am they begin serving lunch items  sliders and tacos i am a huge fan of biscuits and saw that they make their own there i had to try one of their breakfast biscuits i opted to just try a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit sandwich holy cow it was delicious really hit the spot   i never got the opportunity to come back for their lunch items but i had heard from friends that their sliders are delicious after seeing photos of them though i had wished they were served on something other than little hamburger buns not too much excitement there if you ask me id much rather have it on a biscuit  anyways back to the donuts they offer about 12 or so different donut flavors each day they have their standard glazed cinnamon sugar iced donuts each day those are accompanied by different and interesting flavored and sometimes filled donuts check out their instagram page to see what they are serving each day it is a bit addicting logging onto instagram and checking their menus each day  i just wanted to go everyday and try all of them my wallet would be so mad at me being the huge bacon lover that i am i had been waiting to see their maple bacon donut show up on the menu my last day in nola it finally did i was pumped it was delicious fresh flavorful and savory the bacon was honestly pretty good by itself  i tried two of their drinks as well the sprocacola and their arnold palmer sprocacola was interesting to say the least i was glad i tried it  but dont think i will get it again the arnold palmer was also pretty decent my ratio of tea to lemonade was a bit off though  too much lemonade  the establishment as a whole appeared clean and organized my party and i were always able to find a seat no matter how busy it was so with all of this said i would definitely go back if in the area againyou will not find a more authentic place as this from the decor to the food to the wait staff mercedes parked out back this is 100 greek and authentic food is fantastic from the pita bread and hummus to the authentic greek cuisine while it may have touristy feel there are plenty of locals and greek people eating here i enjoyed every min of our experience here there were so many choices on the menu that it was tough to choose i had the combination along with a greek salad delicious  you wont be disappointedthis is my goto neighborhood bar the ambiance is awesome i love all the cool retro lighting they have the staff is friendly and the food is solid we typically like to go on the later side of the evening around 10 or 11 at that hour i dont see how you could have any issues with servers or food what i really like about his place is that the menu is really seasonal they always have something new and interesting to try i particularly remember a really great  arugula and watermelon salad i had over the summer go and enjoyi had the wheat berry salad sooooo amazing the bartender not sure of his name took great care of me and was so sweet love this placeabsolutely love this place i arrived right before they opened sorry at like 950 the woman i think the owner was so nice and had great energy i got a spicy tuna bowl and a juice and both were amazing and the bowl was substantial for a size small this place is definitely a cute little hidden gem its drive through only which i kinda like it was a little difficult maneuvering my car but worth it definitely will be back to try an aa bowlfinally somebody giving sweetie pies some type of competition   had the smoked pork steak it was excellent  so tender it was falling to pieces i also had enough to take home  warm up later   the dressing was tasty as well  a difficult feat  didnt get to try the banana pudding or shrimp and grits but ill definitely make my way backwe are still improving and alot has to be done but overnights are alot better now that we have ppl willing to work for our customers i heard the horror stories from a few years ago nothing is like that now soon we will be serving breakfast all day and night long our shake machines are down at 12am6am for automatic cleaning you dont want to eat fungus do you didnt think so as far are frappas they are open all night long ice coffee is limited but can be made on a special request i work the grill i make sure all our customers get fresh food every single time its my duty to give you the kind of sandwich that you ordered through our cashier im a one man team who works in the grill area i cant be responsible for what happens beyond the sandwiches i hear every single order as you tell it to the cashier im not crying out for 15 an hour  im just happy to have a job and take very much pride in my work if we are not selling ice cream frappas or ice coffee please understand that we must clean the machines before we can serve them nobody is trying to get anyone sick over old product not while im there they wont i been in mcdonalds far to long to allow customers to get sick on my watch so we do apologize in advance and hope you completely understand new management new way of mcdonalds welcome back everyonenormally evaluating a fast food chain would be absurd butchurchs chicken rocks so much better than kfc and if you are nursing a hangover this hits the spot the biscuits are buttery sweet goodness mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection the right amount of stiffness without being a brick although i recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste  just like i remember from my southern upbringing do not count calories at this place and no i do not make it a habit to hit up churchs on a weekly basis i consider i nice treat every couple of months price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on lindbergh in south county if i am going to do fast food this is my place of choicedaves dogs is a hot dog stand in a parking lot  nothing fancy just delicious hot dogs and a place to sit and enjoy them   but they are not your usual hot dogs  they are gourmet hot dogs five to choose from  daves style western style sb style bbq bacon and pizza dog    i tried the pizza dog it was sooooo good  a wiener topped with pepperoni pizza sauce cheese and parmesan 500  the secret ingredients to daves dogs hot dogs is the quick and friendly service  cool and calm personality  and it seems great pleasure is taken to making each hot dog a masterpiece   overall a great atmosphere for hungry yelpers good times and delicious hot dogsfirst time to district donuts and whew it was amazing started out with a cold brew and the best cinnamon roll of my life there were so many scrumptious looking donuts i wanted to try but once i saw that cinnamon rolli was sold they warmed it up and the sugar at the top caramelized to add a bit of a crunch mmm   i also ordered a couple of sliders cali fries and their croque madam sandwich like a dummy when i heard the name sarah at the counter i rushed to get my sandwichbut like every other 20 year old girl who are also named sarah i started munching into the wrong sandwich i felt a little guilty once i realized it but boy was it delicious the guys behind the counter called out my actual order and when i told them what happened they couldnt have been nicer about it gave me my complete order and offered to go boxes if we needed it very friendly staff the cali fries werent my absolute favoritefelt like they were just doused in mayo but sandwiches and sliders were very yummy this place is definitely deserving of your visithad the sweet potato pancakes waited in line outside for an hour but it was so worth it the atmosphere was great and the service was top notch always recommend the pancake pantrythis is a great fresh fish marketlobster shack if you want fancy this isnt the place for you styrofoam plates and lots of lobster jessica rocked at customer service i shot a claw across the restaurant newb and she brought a new claw try the crab cakes and bread puddinggreat place to grab some casual brunch and a latte on a sunday i recommend the veggie bagel and the chai latte the biscuits and gravy are also on point thanks henrys ill be backthis place was my favorite brunch place in new orleans i didnt mind taking the walk down magazine street just to eat here stopped by the shop twice during my one week vacation in new orleans   i loved the concept of having different specialty donuts and sliders on each day of the week and the sliders were delicious with every bite that i took a must go to place when you stay in new orleanslots of great beer yum yum neat feel to this place we ended up arriving just before a tarential downpour so we couldnt sit outside but they have lots of outdoor seating if you can stand the heathumidity staff very nice i rarely give 5 starts but i just enjoyed this place so much lots of locals playing board games and cards an over all great place for drink they even have a few wine choicesi have been going to bakery house for years and absolutely love it every time i usually get the chocolate chip cake its my favoritehands down my favorite restaurant in philly and i love many restaurants in philly its as if some lovely greekcypriot family invited me to their home for a lovely greekcypriot dinner provided i bring my own wine and pay them about 40 id accept that invitation any day   kanella simply offers classic rustic dishes made with fresh often organic ingredients by a chef who obviously cares a lot about his food youll see him buzzing around the dining room advising diners on how best to enjoy the dishes before them might come off as heavyhanded but this guy knows exactly what hes doing   biggest hits for me include the whole fish or any filet on the menu duck breast and pork loin for dessert its always the galaktobureko heaven   brunch is fantastic too and an even more affordable way to enjoy kanella plus the service is always spoton no matter how full the restaurant isi was here on the soft opening day 1118 the official opening is on 1121 drinks were buy one get one they were handshaking all the drinks so it took a while our order was after a big group one so it took 30 minutes to get our two orders they are still working things out so its understandable   the boba here are are very unique they are clear and jelly like in texture with a hint of something fruity it was a refreshing change they appear to specialize in foam milk teas i ordered a standard boba milk tea which is the equivalent of ordering chicken tenders and fries at a restaurant it was okay but the boba made it worth it my sister ordered a boba sakura oolong tea without the foam she enjoyed it very much and will be coming back   the decor of this place is super cute and i would rate it the cutest bubble tea in chinatown the owner is also very friendly and nicejust had a very pleasant visit  vietnamese coffee was bomb  a bit too sweet for my liking but still delicious and hit the spot  moist flavorful fried chicken sandwich with a nice buttermilk crunchy slaw  the bread was pillowy and tasty  finally tried the nutella donut which was perfection  friendly service highly recommendgreat selection of yogurts and toppings  great place to bring children they have lots of tables to sit and enjoy your dessertthis place is great  customer service the man i spoke to on the phone was polite and helpful and the delivery was fast 55  food i ordered eggplant parmesan lemon chicken soup baklava and a soda everything was delicious no complaints whatsoever 55  price very affordable if you order delivery before 4pm there is no minimum for your delivery order and no extra delivery charge 55  really impressed with this place i cant wait to try all the other food on the menugreat food and great service we came in the late afternoon and we had no problem well definitely come backyou know that really good authentic boudin that some new orleanians drive to lake charles or breaux bridge to get for big gatherings  well i got that delicious quality boudin this weekend without the long drive i just took the new rampart streetcar to the end and walked a couple of short blocks to shank  i also bought some sausage cant wait to try it soon and will be heading back often to stock up on the other meats i had always enjoyed their prepared meals but im especially excited to have such a terrific butcher nearbywe recently checked out gm bistro off la canada and lambert and it was cramped noisy and the food was average only soso  what a pleasant surprise to find chopstix and have a really superior experience  im very strictly glutenfree and they have a real glutenfree menu with about 6 pages not just a handful of choices  my husband ordered the orange chicken the same meal as he had at gm for a true comparison and raved about how much better it was at chopstix i had a lettuce wrap appetizer  almost 2 off during happy hour  consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself and was incredibly tasty  i loved it so much i ordered a second one had about 45 more wraps out of it then had to have them box up the rest  i hated to have to stop eating it was so good but i was so full  i have a medical situation where i have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner and i cant remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me  and most of the time its rare that i can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them  so the service was excellent the food was outstanding and i had a lovely conversation with the manager whose last day it was  he has worked with the southern arizona celiac association so the employees at chopstix are extremely welleducated re gluten issues there which is great because i got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at native new yorker due to poor education on gluten crosscontamination they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading  if i could give more than 5 stars i would  this is definitely a restaurant that is getting put high on our list of ones to frequent oftengood breakfastnot all your traditional meals but fresh and delicious i love the nest sub with scrambled eggs  ask for jelly after you eat the eggs out of the biscuit they make their own staff is friendly and quick  several pastrybaked options at the register  yum  fresh coffee and latteswe had lunch today at hellas  it never disappointsone of our favorite places for years tried the flaming oopa cheesevery tasty the best greek salad anywhere service shines with young

it away ordered the skillet taco and let me tell you it was so full of flavor and meat i couldnt finish it would definitely recommend this placemy wife and i have been coming into josefs on the weekends for some time their baked goods are awesome i like having them warmed and served at a table with some coffee their lunch and breakfast menu is nice especially their eggs some items are misses but with such a variety of things to try its ok if one or two items dont work  the service has been good as well i hate waiting for a check or to order but ive only had one bad day since weve been

sampled a few favors before settling in on two everything we sampled was good and it was too hard too decide the employee also explained to us the story of how they were founded which added to the experience so if youre on central and have a sweet tooth this is definitely a good place to gomy goodness  this good was amazing i had the big easy which came with eggs your way bacon boudin sausage

knowledgeable waitress lauren just loved it well be backi just went here for the first time the chocolate vanilla oreo cupcake actually brought tears to my eyes tears of joy it actually brought me back to tasting chocolate for the very first time as a child simply the best cupcake of any kind i have had in any city or country i have traveled to i cant even imagine an entire cake that tasted like this wow just wow if every cupcake on earth tasted like these there would be world peace and gluten free who wouldve thought it was possible and guys forget the flowers dude if youre in the dog house get your lady some of these cupcakes and youll be in the clear loli recently discovered that im gluten sensitive which makes eating anywhere else but home very difficult for the most part i have sacrificed enjoying a meal out with family because eating something with even a risk of crosscontamination isnt worth it because i feel horrible afterward i was thrilled when i found out about new day here in st louis at our first visit we tried the lasagna biscuits and gravy cheesecake and a brownie yes you can order breakfast and dinner at the same time of day and they were all very good my husband doesnt have a gluten restriction and he loved everything as well im excited about ordering some sweets and freshly baked breads and having them shipped to my home what a nice option a spectacular establishment that instantly takes you back to childhood memories  in a quest to find a favorite yet elusive candy bar our search brought us to cravins  leaving grandpa in the car my daughter and i went in expecting to only spend a few minutes  needless to say we spent way more time and money than originally plannedbut in a good way  cravins carried our holy grail of candy the cup o gold and a bonus was finding mint rocky road since i was visiting from korea on rr i bought an entire box of cog as well as idaho spuds a handful of mint rrs a star wars candy dispenser for my hubbys office and a few other things  i must have walked around the store at least 3 times and know i still didnt see everything that was there  i was very appreciative of the military discount and i cant wait to return on my next trip home to visit familyi finally got my water ice fix this weekend well actually i kind of went twice ssshh the chocolatecherry gelati was seriously orgasmic why did it take me until august to finally make it down there i will definitely be back a few more times while they are still open for the season and if you havent been go i corrupted not one but two ritas fans this weekendwent there because it was featured on one of those tv food shows  wow  this place is excellent  at prime time the lines are long outside and wrap around the corner  expect to waitexpect the wait to be worth it  the food is delicious  the service moves with the precision of a welltrained military unit thats a good thing  prices are fair portions are generous  the variety and unique items make the meal one of those things youll talk about afterwards youll share your positive experience with friends and family and youll go backgreat food great service best fast food restaurant in west nashville the store is always clean and the team is friendlydelightful tea shop in south philly  though im usually one for a beer and a cheesesteak i found myself in here on a lazy saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised  theres more tea than i can shake a stick at but i stuck to what id call an experimental smoothie  the young couple that own the place told me theyd fix me up something sweet and caffinated in a smoothie form so i went with it and it was delicious matchabanana flavored  will returncant go wrong with fradys poboys  then hang out on the corner with a beerfinally made it the outside is worth stopping for you can see where they brew their yummy beer as you pull in the parking lot to the left of the building it looks like theres a place for covered outdoor seating  we went at 530 and got seated right away  great selection of beers out table got the christmas beer white lager hard cider and milk chocolate beers all of which were great the white lager was excellent wish i would have had a second  i ordered the burger and potato wedges this has to be one of the best burgers in the lou  families were there so dont worry about that go and enjoy for a family dinnerthe best chocolate croissant petit pain au chocolat i had in usa  i like the atmosphere very industrial look the place is shared with a wine bar so you can have an excellent sandwich made with a french baguette and a glass of wine it was too early for me i would recommend this placei love this place  their food is just cafe style but i always enjoy what i order lots of gf options which i dont necessarily need but my sister has celiacs so its awesome to have the choice i love the coconut chai with coconut milk this place also has a fun vibe to hang out or study i would definitely recommend it and come here oftenstand in the line look our trip to nashville was two months ago and we still talk about it first dont let the line intimidate you there are a lot of bigger parties that want to be seated to our suprise they were halfway down the line when they found a party of two us we felt like our name had just been called on the price is right we were quickly seated and the waiter was so friendly and answered our questions with ease that cinnamon cream is the thing of perfection those folks back in that kitchen are doing it the pancakes were amazing bacon delicious coffee eggsheaven change the name to pancake heaven we want to go back to nashville but only for pancake pantrythey have amazing sushi  their rolls are creative and different from other places in town   the service is fast  the location is very convenient for me since it is near trader joeswe traveled 1100 miles from bucks county pa we have been checking out the reviews a week prior to our visit we stayed in clearwater and it was well worth the 30 minutes trip a little very down homy type of placewith little atmosphere dont be fooled by the looks but the lobster meal we had was super well worth it we had two lobster bisque cups every spoon full had a large pieces of lobster chunks it was excellent then we both had the lobster roll sandwich although the bread is not like philadelphia quality the lobster made up for it the price did not out way the quality a must do at least oncebest burger joint ive seen in a while nice variety on the menu as far as burgercheesesteakpork style sandwiches go and they do a different special sandwich every weekwhich has consiquently bumped me from a semiregular customer up to a once or twice a week reg  service is friendly from the cashier to the fry guys to josh and his happy helpers in the back theyre always helpful and enjoy chit chat and quick jokes they seem to genuinely enjoy their job and social interaction its always fun to catch them jamming out to the eclectic rock station always playing for ambiance just a chill group of guys n gals i dont want to call the space small because it doesnt feel cramped its more like its interactive and fitting for a fastmoving burger joint think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel low rise tables in front for relaxing some hightops with a different perspective in the corner and the barstyle counter make it so u can pick your style comfort with paintings and articles all over youre bound to have some conversation pieces nearby as well everything seems clean from tables floors and counters to the separate area in the back for butchering meets to the clearly labeled bins for different trash and recyclables overall 5star for these guys try the charlie brown for some philly style comfort foodthis place has some of the best food in dutchtown their space is comfy and cozy and i really need to get there more then i do  attached to them they also have a local art gallery that is always full of amazing local art work  you can also hire them to cater events for you they made the food for a small birthday party i had the food was so good is was gone before i really got to have some myself  also  they host a boardgame night once a month i have never been able to make it but i am gonna make it one of these daysgreat people great ice cream patricia makes the ice cream from scratch make sure you check it outmy favorite local mexican restaurant the chimichangas and cheese dip are delicious busy on monday nights as it is there taco nightthis place is awesome best selection around super friendly and knowledgeable staff and very reasonable prices the bar is really nice and with 30 beers on tap always 2 on nitro you cant beat it definitely the best craft beer store you will find in phillybest seafood place ever  honestly i have never had better fresher juicer lobster ever in my life  i dont mind the long wait and the uncomfortable bar stools  the food is more than enough to make up for it  we generally order the largest lobster they have for the day to go with their deliciously prepared clam chowder  its a muststop whenever im around the areaceliacs in the area def need to check out this place they have a number of gluten free options and accommodate to preventing cross contamination to the best of their abilities if you mention your dietary needs my fav thing from there is their chicken quesadillasamazing burgers craft beers specialty cocktails and homemade ice cream desserts  the burgers you have choices of substituting beef chicken lamb or bison they put a spin on everythingeven the ketchup they even have a weekly burger battle where the most ordered burger lives on another week to get challenged by another special contender   my son and i spilt a banana split that was simply incredible a scoop of triple chocolate and one of coconut crunch with a caramelized bananaget outta here you know the melty part of a banana split at the bottom of the bowl that nobody likeswe didnt find it herethis was the best blt wrap that i have ever had the bacon was  perfectly prepared  thick and crisp but not burntthe real deal  we ate some of the finest pastries ive ever had in my life at this bakery word  we were fortunate enough to be with the other gruntled brunchers who are friends of the proprietors of the bakery so we were treated to a sampling of many of their pastries   just some of what we tried opera cake  a moist multilayered cake which reminded me of tira misu apple strudels fruit tarts  eclairs chocolate covered strawberries all were delicious but then the cheese puff pastry came out   the cheese puff pastry is on a level all its own impossibly insanely flaky just sweet enough almost salty how can this be i could have eaten five of these make certain you dont miss this  we were fortunate to be there on good friday so we could get a hot cross bun i thought a hot cross bun was some hard crusted bread with a cross cut in the top for rising i was so so wrong this traditional treat is a briochetype bread with a tiny sprinkling of sweet fruit pieces throughout and an icing x drawn on the top again light airy with sweetness that is a hint not a sledgehammer theres a bunch of history behind the hot cross bun and patricia the executive chef took the time to tell us check it out on wikipedia if youre curious  and i have to say something about the raspberry bear claw if youve ever had what others call a bear claw forget those brent said its an insult to this crazygood flaky justright pastry to name it the same thing you can get out of a vending machine   we took a field trip as harry said through the kitchen where ziggy the owner pastry chef and allaround nice guy was making a harry potter wizard hat cake he rolled out fondant icing and expertly threw the thick layer over the cake he gave us a taste of the fondant in my experience fondant is pretty but not so tasty not so for this chocolate fondant mmmmmmm i would happily have eaten a huge slab of this stuff   we left with a tea cake in tow ziggy told us it was something like a kugelhof and not as heavy as a pound cake it was so beautiful i simply had to try one though at this point i really didnt need more pastries i had a piece as soon as i could get a knife again unbelievablei cant say more somehow it was simultaneously buttery but light and just moist enough without approaching stickiness i had more of this than i care to admit right after id eaten my weight in sweets  at this point im glad i do not live down the street from maple street patisserie i could see myself having a problem if i lived too close to a bakery this tempting  just to sum it all up the sweet pastries are delectable but the breads brioches bear claws and tea cakes are in a class all their own  and i havent even tried the savory croissants yetgreat staff great drinks the 5 is because they make my current favorite local beer the undisputed shadow boxer very nice place inside and i highly recommend a stop here at some point in your night outinsane   the best foodie joint ive eaten at for fast casual chain   burgers are amazing but you must try the onion ringswe are in the middle of a coast to coast road trip and spent a long day in st louis with 3 small kids so i was grateful to find this place on yelp  it was near our hotel and was a perfect mix of tasty food and kidfriendly in a grownup environment saw lots of couples on dates as well   the fullsized power salad was huge and tasty kids chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken and were delicious and the burgers were amazing fries and sides were creative service was prompt friendly and very welcome after a hot exhausting day ice cream was homemade and creamy   perfectthis brewery was phenomenal and our rock n rolla beer we drank was perfect crazy it was brewed in house the environment of the brewery is so much fun especially when the garage doors are open great food great atmosphere and even better service by the servers live music tooif you have the chance eat here food is fresh and so tasty amazing service i have never done a review on yelp before may not again but loved this place so much i felt compelled to sharesuch a great place for gifts nv themes and other homemade items plus antiques beautiful artwork of all types etc in a new location but still in the same mall just a much bigger store  check it outthis ice cream was deliciously decadent and one of the creamiest ive ever had so sad they are sellingthe shrimp poboy was out of this world and the white chocolate bread pudding was delicious theres no drivein option take out onlyamazing food and service excellent exo coffee  vegetarian and gluten free options highly recommended i used the app to put our party on the wait list and by the time we arrived we were seated in under 10 minutes  what a gem of a placeyum thank you anthony for the great lasagna and the best carrot cake ever kudos also for the delicious homemade lentil soup i should have taken an extra one of those to go reservations to go is the answer for good food and great servicethe cauliflower pizza is the best we will be back again  again to get some pre made protein packs  and look around for more healthy and delish goodies loved the cauliflower sandwich too great placethis place is awesome stopped in for lunch last week and had a spirit tasting flight delicious then a beer tasting flight even more delicious seriously good beers pork belly tacos were yummy as was the artichoke and kale dip and the spinach salad with a soft boiled egg the bartender was super knowledgeable as well and answered every question we had about the spirits beer food and the amazing space that they have ill be coming back every time i go to renoi miss this place soooo much  probably my favorite frozen custard place in the entire world  the hype is totally worth it  please make a chain around the us and japanbig store decent selection plenty of parking and rather convenient location the building is well lit items are always stocked and if you have trouble finding anything  employees arent far to ask everyone seems in a positive mood happy to greet you and happy to help i am a big fan of the fresh squeezed juice their sandwiches and all the snacks you can buy i dont do my regular weekly shopping here but i still stop in frequently and pick up a thing here and there when i need or have a want for it i have no complaints about this location its wonderfullove this rouses the store is always immaculately clean which is a huge plus for me and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful  the prices can be a bit high sometimes so i dont go there for my big grocery trips but i do stop in a few times a week for things i run out of or forget  additionally the hot bar salad bar and ready made meals are a go to for a quick but tasty lunch  one thing that stands out is if the store doesnt have something  they can order it and call you when its in one of the employees in the frozen foods section named alton was extremely helpful in getting a hard to find item ordered for me and personally called me when it was in amazing customer servicethis place is a gem and i highly recommend it  i had read some really positive comments about it on twitter so i decided to try it today and i was not disappointed  its a bakerycoffee shop that also has a great lunch menu  the food is expertly prepared and extremely creative  they seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients for example today i had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy the mushroom tart i ate today was rich buttery and delicious of course its a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good  they have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on twitter and facebook its haunting me and i might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow  they also make their own bagels which is super exciting for this bornandraisednew yorker everything is made fresh every day i was told by the friendly helpful man who waited on me at the counter  the place itself has a nice clean modern decor its a long narrow space with the pastry countercash register towards the back and about six or seven small tables running down the length of the room with chairs and a comfortable bench with pillows i didnt stay long today but it looks like the type of place you could go hang out and drink coffee for a while or go have lunch with a friend    i dont even live uptown but i hope to become a regular at this place  revised on 992013 to add  i have been back here a few times and i can now report that they have some of the best espresso drinks in the city  super yummy lattesthis bakery is amazing from the decor to the quality of the service  come to the frosted fox for friendky service from thr owners and then try one of their delicious desserts  the prices are incredibly reasonable the biggest problem is figuring out what you want to order i recommend the giant snicker doodle cookie or the mm cookie both were amazing and you really cant go wronggreen eggs and ham sandwich was delicious the biscuit was peppery and perfectly baked we also had the ricotta toast and i was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was i highly recommend this place for an early morning breakfast spotfirst time here tonight we got a salted caramel cupcake a mocha chocolate chip cupcake and a peanut butter pudding the cupcakes were moist  the frosting was so silky and creamy so good but the star of the show was the peanut butter pudding holy crow  never had anything like it before  it was more of a creamywhipped mousse like pudding the peanut butter flavor was not too sitting strong or overwhelming like peanut butter can be  throughout was some of her peanut butter cookies  so soft  it mixed wth the pudding like perfection we live in nj but we will absolutely be backrecently moved away from st louis and i miss this place the atmosphere is very interesting and unique first of all the decor is pretty unusual and its fun to sit on the balcony the food is great and all locally sourced and homemade even their ice cream and really if you go you have to try the ice cream my favorite thing to order is the rumchata milkshake which is made from rumchata and their homemade cinnamon ice creamlove their food  mimosas  appreciate the second location in tucson  just be prepared for a bit of a wait during peak timesfive stars an unbelievable place i dont think i can do it for fisher years now but i think         this starbucks always makes drinks correctly and the drive thru is fast even on busy morningswow fantastic greek food at its finest i had the lamb pita which is phenomenal with the fries also phenomenal the desserts and dips are also so great definitely a place to go to when in nashvillebest pizza in town staff is always friendly especially jordan the pizza is good priced less than 9 and a good size there is a variety of toppings and its unlimited toppings its easy and is pretty fast only 5 minutes for a pizza i recommend herb butter for the oil and barbecue for the sauce welcome to the neighborhoodexcellent food and service the place is functional and funky at the same time great choices for breakfast and lunch and a welcoming environment and staffjust about to get tucked into a meatloaf that is smelling amazing and about to get devouredthe ice cream is amazing and very inexpensive they have a drive thru for convenience and they have a wonderful staff  deliciousmy wife and i have been coming here with our son for the last few saturdays it has become our absolute favorite breakfast spot we even occasionally meet up with friends and family here   so far we have tried 3 different varieties of the crepes and they are ridiculously delicious most if the crepe shops i find try to over do the fillings or toppings to mask the lack of flavor in the crepes not this place perfect balance of everything without being too much  my wife has tried a couple sandwiches and they have all been awesome  the smoothies are killer and made with locally sourced ingredients   the owner has even come out and sat with us she is super accommodating and personable  the only downside to the station is the lack of advertising if there was a bigger sign we would have found this place sooner lolbuddy brew is the place to go for morning coffee and a delicious breakfast their toast totally blows my mind its the best toast ive had in a long time possibly ever parking around 730 am can be a challenge though bc the lot gets very crowdedhands down the best pancakes i have ever had  i have been here 4 times already and i have never been disappointed the pancakes here are so good and the milky cinnamon syrup that they serve is the best thing ive put in my mouth must try are the sweet potato pancakes and the banana pancakes ive also tried their eggs and sausage combo and their omelettes and they both were amazing  the great thing about the combos is that you can substitute your regular buttermilk pancakes with any of the specialty pancakes if you want a hearty meal i recommend the omelette the staff is really nice and the inside is bigger than i thought when i was outside the only downside about the place is that if you go on weekends there is going to be a line that is wrapped abound the building this place is super popular when tourists so it might be a long wait but i think it is so worthwe got up early on our vacation just to get to pancake pantry before the line  it was well worth it  the selection of pancake styles is amazing  i had traditional and my bf had pecan both were wonderful and were complimented perfectly by the salty deliciousness of bacon on the side  we were told to ask for mary and truly she was the sweetest waitress alive    this place is well worth the wait but you could also get up an hour earlier than normal and beat the crowdshort waits strong drinks great food service sets them apart my bloody was damn good and damn strong eat hereamazing bbq the smoked pork sandwich was one of the best that i have had in years and the onion rings were definitely the best in st louis we will definitely be coming backwell i just want to say we came here by chance and we are very lucky that we did  the warm atmosphere very excellent server delicious food and happy hour was a bonus   dont miss this neighborhood eaterybari really cant say enough about this place  the food only seems to increase in flavor as they get to know me as a personal customer i appreciate this so much and the professionalism that goes behind their customer servicei would totally recommend this place as your next italian ordergreat neighborhood bar with a casual atmosphere  this place is always extremely clean and the staff is always friendly and cheerful    village pub offers a good selection of beers which are priced very well  style points awarded for serving the dark  stormy in vintage pewter mugs  in regards to food offerings dont forget to try the italian sausages they are incrediblethis place is worth it stop in and try it you wont regret it i am not a big meat eater but i do love some good bbq at times i had the burnt ends and it was awesome ive been here 3x now and each time was great portion sizes are large enough to share nice place to eat in or take outsoooo good for only 6 bucks you get like half a pound of tender meats melt cheeses fresh veggies and tender crisp awesome breads that can feed two well  lots of beverages and sides to choose as well awesome for lunch grocery is amazing so many italian imports of fancy jarred things excellent selection of fresh meats seafood spices wines amazing cheese room mmm still warm handmade mozzarella oh my the cheese room odor alone is worth a few high end crackers mmmmmmmthis was the best vegan food ive ever had i ordered a 10 crispy hipcity ranch chicken sandwich and it tasted like a classic chicken sandwich but perhaps even better the flavors were so good and i quickly devoured the juicy sandwich this location also had really friendly service  ive tried their 4 banana whip at a hipcityveg food truck it was pretty good and is essentially healthy banana ice cream  im very tempted to go back again tomorrow and id go vegan for a day a week if it meant i could eat here enjoyed our meals here  the service was great and the sangrias are the best in town  my husband had the all time favorite spaghetti and meatballs and i filled up on their amazing chicken alfredo your way and i added shrimp which were succulent and huge  i would highly recommend this restaurant to those who like a smaller environment with personal service  they were very busy for mothers day but the service was great and it did not take long for our food to arrive  they were certainly prepared for the day and they even gave all mothers a fresh cut red rose  excellent food great service and wonderful environmentour familys favorite place for breakfast  the hashbrowns are the reason to go along with the eggs provencale  my son loves the french toast with fresh strawberries so much he eats an adults serving no problem  visit the attached bakery for some of the best pastries in tucson   it could be a scary location for nontucson natives but dont fret  this kind of weird setting in a ghetto strip mall next to a crappy safeway is what tucson is all about  you wont be disappointedmy family loves frost  this is the only place we go when we want a cool treat  love every flavor that weve gotten my favorites are dark chocolate and salted carmelreally enjoyed the unique style of ice cream here great ice cream spot in the usf area i strongly recommend this place and will definitely be back to try some of the other flavorsok so i have been really trying to not be so generous with 5 star reviews but with kanella i cannot help it   we had a reservation for breakfast sunday at 1030am  and yes you need a reservation sunday morning and were seated promptly by 11am the place was jammed  our server was excellent and extremely informative i was amazed to see how affordable the breakfast and lunch platters were i went with the kanella platter  stuffed grape leaves spicy tomato salad fried egg plant white beans falafel tsaziki pita bread and olives  for all of 12 my gf got the same but her roommate  ordered the english breakfast  baked beans enormous link of sausage the most amazing bacon grilled tomato and fried eggs for 10   i have seen some reviews on here and people complain about grounds in their coffee  umm all they serve is either french press coffee or greek coffee which is a lot like turkish coffee  it is expected to have grounds in it  the french press coffee was amazing as well   as i write this i see that i am using the word amazing an awful lot but i cant help it   i also ordered greek yogurt with honey and walnuts which was unrealsee i didnt use amazing here  my gf who hates greek yogurt really enjoyed it   all in all the food was

beers and very happy to let you sample and ask about your daybeen coming here for months and between the beer down to earth awesome waiters and incredible beers this has been one of my favorite places for a while  the black bean burger here is incredible i wouldnt call it the best in town just yet but i did drive out of the way to come here just to have it  if your an ipa person you have to stop by for the dragon fly which is on tap year around every sunday when they have 3 pints we drive up here from south indy just for the dragonflyburger combo and now that its warmer outside the outdoor seating really tops it all off lets not leave out the free wifithe best hotdogs around no lie i used to say down town la or pinks hotdogs were the best but nope  daves dogs are bomb plus he has something different on his secret menu every week  staff is really nice i go at least once a weektheres just something different about the seafood here located a short cab ride from downtown philly is dinardos a nondescript red brick building with a wooden sign swaying in the breeze points to the front entrance of this establishment the huge crab on their sign hints that maybe you should try the crab the blue claw crabs are flown in everyday from the gulf coast unlike their cousins in the chesapeake these gulf coast crabs are free swimmers which means bigger crabs and more meat  lets look at their raw bar clams on the half shell are half dozen freshly shucked icecold beauties served atop ice accompanied by cocktail sauce and lemon these clams are sweet with a scent of the sea  these are the best clams on the half shell i have ever had the cocktail sauce is the best cocktail sauce ive ever had sweet with just the right amount of horseradish thumbs up with 5 starscame in for the beer and a burger lunch venture when looking at the beer menu i wanted to try a little of everything thats when i was suggested the flight which is a series of different 4ounce beers brought to the table to sample not a bad start   i then ordered the the butcher burger which had a combination of ground short rib brisket and chuck thats when i was sent onto another world of palate satisfying comma this is the spot for a good variety of beers and good food will come again to try other things on the menu   great job guysprobably one of my favorite places to go the appetizers are amazing would recommend getting the brussels sprouts the fish tacos  the pretzels the beer is amazing always taste so fresh ive tried every beer they brew and not one of them i didnt likeexcellent place for gelato the best there is on st louis lovely garden patio in the rear ample seating with tables and armchairs both downstairs and upstairs with free wifi throughoutfood is bomb  plus good servers  right by river  you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by eating heregrapefruit ipa legit incredible   great atmosphere and the fact that its pet friendly scorebeing a missouri girl i was raised on bbq eli knows how to bbq its all about the meat and the smoke the ribs are my favorite they are tender pulling off the bone just right the chicken sides and bbq sauce are great but the meat is the kingthank god there is finally a decent coffee shop in brandon and i dont have to settle for starbucks any longer i got a cold brew and my boyfriend got a frozen latte and it was under 10 after tip i am so happy right nowthe shrimp tacos and margaritas are reason enough to come  i have a local taco next to my house on fatherland but drive to this location because the cook is top notch  the bartender explained that he tweaks some of the recipes and it works havent had anything bad here  the margarita mix is made inhouse and you can tell  it is super fresh  dont even bother getting a top shelf margarita the house is that goodtook the grapes n hops tour with shawn  my wife and i had a fantastic time  there were three wineries and a stop at figueroa brewing to end the tour  sogno del fiori was our favorite stop  the owner is very cordial and has a true depth of knowledge reagarding all aspects of wine  we had a great time on the tour and i would highly recommend this companyi found mommoms food cart at a night market and now theyve opened a brickandmortar restaurant around the corner at 2551 orthodox street in bridesburg score  sorry this is a bit of a bare bones review but when i looked at the reviews and saw there was only one from 2018 and none so far for the restaurant i felt like i had to get another recent one up   the food is delicious  flavorful and more complex than i expected i wasnt raised in a polish family but friends who were say its also very authentic the pierogi dough is so soft and light its almost like a crepe the atmosphere is charming and homey and the service is friendly knowledgeable and lowkey the vanillabourbon apple sauce is all i care about in the world from this point on the kielbasy is from czerws down in port richmond and it is great  my partners family has it for christmas every year i highly recommend the gobki  its got some zing and luckily for me reheats beautifully since i totally overordered my first time here also i had never heard of pickle soup but now i want it all the time especially when its cold and rainy and im feeling under the weather all of the bread they serve here  the long rolls the dark rye  is excellent do yourself a favor and stop by this unpretentious byob gemice cream martinis what more could one want one a friday night their food is good as well portions are filling and taste good the ambience of the place is what really sold it for me its a great hangoutfresh baked goods with kawha coffee their concept of selling mini size cakes is genius my kids ordered a couple mini size cakes with a mini glass of milk one mini with milk is just 150 the owner is passionate about this shop and i hope they grow to the point that they can be open everyday the best item on the menu is the banana pie i also like the red velvet and chocolate caramelamazing fudge shop owned by wonderful people you can taste whatever you want before you make a choice and the people who work there are really nice and funmy husband and i eat at molldeli about once a week marking it one of our favorite lunch spots were kind of food snobs and we find it to be a great experience all around the restaurant was purchased by its current owner maybe 6 months ago and it has certainly changed for the better the menu is now chef inspired with the specials truly highlighting the talented kitchen but quite honestly both my husband and i have our favorites on the regular menu so we rarely even make it to the special board   we all know the foundation of a great sandwich is delicious bread and molldelli has certainly figured that out both the regular hoagie roll and the wheat roll are fantastic my husbands favorite sandwich is the hot salami but do be warned it is super spicy and i adore the chicken club but lately weve both been fixated on the buffalo chicken salad its so good you know when you order a salad and the ratio of lettuce to toppings is off thats very much not the case with this salad  you have plenty of toppings from start to finish the only change we make to it is having the chicken served hot on the menu its cold its just a personal preference but for us it makes it just slightly better   no matter what you order at molldeli you will have a great food experience they appeal to all customers having both the traditional and more daring menu items available i agree with the sign  best sandwiches off the hillthis place makes all other sweet shops look like amateurs i had a chance to try their salted caramel banana pudding and their hot apple cider let me tell you  once you try their stuff you wont want anything else other than their sweets  they are that good  also the folks that run and work at this shop are very friendly they make you feel like you are at home no pretentiousness here either its all about putting out a superior product and they succeedwife absolutely loved the scramble  they have children toys and books  my son read a book while we waited for our food  i got the breakfast sandwich and it was decent but i felt toast was too crispy  im just being picky its a nice breakfast cafe with moderate prices  id prefer to give it 4 stars but my wife wouldnt stop talking about how much she loved her breakfast so im going with a 5tampabaybrewingan outstanding brewery and food establishment the brew is wonderfully diverse and delicious while the food is on point the atmosphere and service at westchasesure its the same in yboris wonderful and makes you never want to leave a must if youve never been here loved the grand raison belgian strong ale 122 wow too bad there arent more starswent here for a weekday lunch did two ala cartes and two all you can eats all the rolls were fresh and  tasted marvelous recommendincredibly impressed  im relatively new to the philadelphia area and took my parents here to show them what the city has to offer and we were all blown away  delicious food affordable prices great ambience and very kind staff  we even got a cyprus travel brochure from the restaurant owner after asking about how the food was made  i might take him up on the offer at some pointdelicious and authentic thailaos byob that i would definitely try again  i dont usually wander too far into west philadelphia but ill have to make an exception for this place with the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing ill have to return sooner than later especially for the thai tea as well some places make it watery but it was made just the way i liked it  staff was friendly and attentive service was a little slow but it was a busy saturday night so it was understandable a must tryhere is a tea review yup a tea review for bittersweet   tea tea tea this is our second time here 5 years apart super nice service both times   now he i assume the owner brews iced tea over 12 to 16 hours it is really good really really good you can tell he takes pride in this tea and his establishment  this time i also had a fantastic almond croissant the white icing is wonderful should have bought two the husband took way too much from his bite in the past we had cupcakes and also really enjoyed these  we will be back on our next nola visit for certainhavent tried the restaurant but the bakery i can assure you is as as greek as greek can be from traditional pastries to pastries with a twist you will not be disappointed always fresh always good  service with a smile   lively greek music encourages you to not only   sing along but dance toogus is the best  his commitment to quality ingredients and preparation details are inspiring  unfortunately i got my platter today and had no falafelfrom a falafel truck  so after browsing yelp i learned that his fryer broke and the cost is too high to fix  i started a gofundme to see if we can raise the 3k to bring back falafel  its under falafel fryer for gus  httpswwwgofundmecomfalafelfryerforgusholy cow this place is good  i was in the area and hungry so of course i turned to yelp  i read that other reviewers loved the shrimp tacos  oh my god they are amazing  i also tried the taco al pastor and it was great  next time ill try a burrito but im definitely coming back for more shrimp tacosgreat greek food with friendly service from alan  i had a lamb gyro from a place down south this week that confirmed that santorini offers the best gyro around and definitely my favoritestarted with a few drinks nice custom cocktail selection waitress was real nice and went through the menu with us its almost all shared plates very trendy cool concept rarely pulled off well started with buffalo pork belly and meatballs pork belly was really good good spicy and fatty  you have to be into that thing meatballs were excellent the only thing i would have wanted were toast points or crustinis to dip in the left over sauce the margarita pizza was awesome wood fired thin sauce which i believe belongs on a pizza and a doughy thin crust finished up with some vanilla and nutella gelato great meal well be backworth it we have been going to the crabby bills group for over 30 years and its still pretty damn goodthe food was excellent dont let the rating discourage you everything we ordered was great the outside patio was also really pleasant and the service was really good tooi love this place gourmet breakfastbrunch fare at not too high prices the bloody mary should be on a magazine coverreservations gourmet togo is often overlooked at as a seminole heights eatery but shouldnt be reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook the kicker is that if you have been to reservations youll crave it even when you have time to cook  reservations serves quality home cooked meals togo and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious  not only is reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated the owners anthony and elke live here in seminole heights and make everything from scratch  one order will usually serve a two people  we have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers  the order pictured to left included  yankee pot roast fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots onions green beans and potatoes for 1195  chicken rustica  boneless breast sauted with crushed red pepper garlic capers olives tomato and romano for 1195  the yankee pot roast was good but the chicken rustica was fantastic btw i am a fan of olives  the mashed potatoes are great and the salads are above average other hits include the chicken marsala and the meatloaf reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the polenta lasagna polenta layered with portobellos parmesan mozzarella and pomodoro sauce  reservations specials change weekly make sure you sign up for their email list which is on a clipboard on the front counter  there is seating at reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich  the hot sandwiches are a must try topping the hot sandwich list are the hot meatloaf hoagie and the buffalo chicken finger sub for 795 each  if you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you 450 the cheese cake is a hit among neighbors but i have to give my personal recommendation to the carrot cake i am not a fan of carrot cake but the reservations version kicks asszios is honestly one of my favorite pizza places in philadelphia for anyone from nynj its one of the few places you could get classic pies like they make over the bridge sandwiches pastas salads and appetizers are all pretty good too staff has always been very friendly and treat us well when we eat insuch a cute shop and the owner is so nice she recommended a lot of spots around the city for us too go check out this shop for all of your souvenir needs as you age your tastes in everything changes after entering adulthood and the expected tour of duties of the bar scene you may be fortunate to find some friends who also share the same fear of alcohol and partying as you do although i grew up with board games my friends werent board game frenzied yet and the ones we played werent as engaging as the ones we have found with age thankfully it seems like my group of friends have reached an age where sitting around a table with teacoffeewinebeer and a good board game is more enjoyable than dreading the morning headache and dads after a night of clubbing  i still play the classics like rummicub life cluedo but if you ask some avid board gamers in their mid to late 20s they might mention games you may never heard of such as 7 wonders suburbia love letter dominion and the ever favorite but not mine settlers of catan  as board gamers these new breeds of board games are sometimes much more expensive than the games youre used to some creep close to 10000 based on popularity and awards  an alternative to buying the games is to head on to table top cafe and renting games for the day instead of going to a coffee shop to read a nice book why not go to a cafe with some friends and play some board games for a spectacular cost of 500 this is a great way to try new games before taking the plunge they even have some tasty pastries hot teas coffees and beer too if you like to play and eat which is great because this way you wont smear your grubby fingers on my board set  their selection of board games  is quite impressive i would even say they carry games that trump even river city games in terms of selection like a game you just played no problem you can purchase a brand new copy in store unfortunately like most physical retailers their mark up is about average and the same as river city but if youre in a rush to just buy a game right away and dont plan on buying many games off online retailers to save on shipping this is a great alternative  oh did i also mention i offensively played cards against humanity for a few hours quite loudly and it was perfectly acceptable thats an ok in my book  pro tip book a table in advanced to guarantee your spot  pop up video fact locally owned and runtheir bobba is amazing all of the food ive tried is exquisite and reasonably priced i would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their foodi finally can get to the business of writing a review on ted drewes since i have now tried a few other places mainly out of driving convenience  wow nothing else compares to the picasso of frozen custardted drewes  i have never had a poorly made custard here   it truly is an amazing artfully made dessert  plainly put all of the other custard shop experiences have fallen far short of ted drewes  i always receive a very creamy delightful and flavorful frozen custard with the perfect mix in and the perfect balance of flavor  easily the gold standardchery did a magnificent  job creating a desert bar that was beautiful and filled with delicious cakes cup cakes tarts and brownies our guest all made comments about how excellent the deserts were she was so sweet and helpful in guiding me in selections to offer the presentation was beautifuli stumbled on this adorable local coffee house while waiting for a store to open in the same shopping center the service was excellent its well furnished with both tables and lounge areas including a small reading book cute cute cute andthe coffee is brewed to perfectionfirst of all cash only which they prominently display but if youre reading this and didnt catch that in the yelp description youd be missing out on delicious food they have a decent menu of tacos tortas etc in addition they have a large variety of serve yourself condiments that are delicious and make the food that much better its outdoor seating but they have a tent so you are in the shade i would recommend absolutely this as an affordable and delicious lunch optiontruly outstanding foodwith among the friendliest and most enthusiastic service i have experienced  this place is a must and should be on your rotation  please support your locally owned businesses fantastic place to get donuts and their prices are amazing this is definitely my go to place when im craving donutsthis is def on my list of things i miss from philly  cosi was my daily lunch spot for almost two years  the signiture salad is amazing and their homemade bread is like nothing ive ever had  i have tried almost everything on the menu and i have no complaints  sometimes they skimp on portions  my first experience here was way back when it was named xoxoanybody remember that the smores are perfect to share with a date or friends  i always make sure to visit this comforting spot when back in phillywent here twice during my visits to philly in the last 6 months and both time i enjoyed the food here cool lil place and that burgervisiting sb from the midwest and after a long day in wine country our host treated us to carry out pizza mizza  all pies were tasty but my favorite was the one with chicken mushroom and rosemary white sauce  not a combination i would have come up with but theyre the creative people  yumguys the brewpub is my jam weve been coming here rather frequently over the last 3 years much to the chagrin of our wallets and diets id say 90 of the time we get the beer cheese crock my partner likes the esb while i like the monon porter and the lawnmower pale most vegetarian dishes can be made vegan and they have an extensive veg friendly menu the vegan fish and chips is one of my favorite meals in indy but i also love the seitan wings seitan reuben veggie coconut bacon on either the blt or the fried egg sandwich and of course the weekly specials can we make the illinois horseshoe wblack bean burger a regular menu item some people complain that service can be slow or cold but personally thats part of the charm for me servers are always friendly but they are handsoff and leave us to do our thing protip during the warmer months make sure to stop in on thursdays for tails and ales adoptable dogs hang out in the parking lot and strut their stuff to all of us potential adopters its always one of my favorite nights outive been to nordstrom before but this was my first time at this store inside the mall very clean inside lots of varieties to choose from the mens jeans are very costly so you should take advantage of whatever sales that they have they got some good cologne for men and womena few years ago when the cupcake store boom hit the valley my mom and i went on a cupcake tour and tried many different businesses out sugar rush was one of our first stops on our quest for quality cupcakes and we were not disappointed the service is very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their flavors and presentation fast forward to now there were a few birthdays coming up in my family and after spending lots of money on christmas gifts i wanted to keep it simple and affordable sugar rush is very close to my house so i thought why not get everyone some beautiful gourmet cupcakes and a nice card boom easy awesome gift i went in and was greeted by a nice woman who was happy to answer any questions i had after browsing all of the flavors there are a lot something for everybody i ended up buying all of their margarita cupcakes because that flavor was my favorite out of all the ones i tried a few years ago i love that they have containers for just 1 or 2 cupcakes perfect for gifts my family members loved their cupcakes upon seeing them and said they were delicious of course i had to get one for myselfit was just as yummy as i remember i will definitely be back for morethis is my familys go to when we eat out for chinese the place is not big but its decently modern the quantity and the quality of their food are always good some items on the menu might be a little pricy but most of the items off their menu are worth the money one only improvement i can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time weve had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy nevertheless this is a great spot and by far the best chinese food restaurant in the areathis was an outstanding experience great customer service great food will come back again try lane snapper the whole fryafter searching forever we land here wait for a table of 8 was only 30 min really good for last min and no reservation our server kendra handled the table cool and calm her energy gave a home feel to the restaurant we had a few appetizers my personal favorite was the onion rings and the oysters i did not like the gumbo would not recommend that for my entre i had the mahi mahi it was a bit plain but overall the dish was good and last but not least my dessert best is almost last i had the milk chocolate cheesecake with a coffee omg it was soooo yummy i give grand isle a 5star for service food and atmosphere absolutely one of my favorite wf layout  and store inventory good amount of lighting space and inventory of pretty much everything  tip restrooms are located back corner just next to the bakerybest cuban sandwich in town and quite possibly the best black bean soup ive ever had super friendly service this is definitely a spot to check outthe fisherman stew is a satisfying low calorie meal shrimp scallops mussels and atlantic cod swimming in a broth of diced tomatoes sweet peppers and onion in a white wine sauce incredibly flavorful so flavorful in fact that the low calorie idea went to hell as i asked the waiter for bread to sop up all that delightful sauce once the calorie count was forgotten i ended the meal with a small myers lemon tart with berries and a raspberry coulis and a snifter of blantons an extremely tasty and satisfying meal without over eatingive tried many sweet treats here and its all very good this bakery has the taste to be world renown  i hope to see more locations but whatever magic they work in this shop im just happy i can get to it its that goodgreat food truck  burrito is to die for the burrito is packed with flavor and filling you get a piece of fish every bite you get the spice level is just right and it leaves so full but still wanting for more  tacos  are alright nice flavors but nothing too special most of the time the avocados arent very ripe so you dont really get any flavor from it   katsu  is pretty good i love the sauce they drizzle the chicken and rice with i just wish they would put a little bit more sauce on it i sorta wish there was more going on because it is essentially breaded chicken with rice and a salad   gave 5 stars because the fish burrito is that good it is the only thing i need from this truck it is just so goodexcellent got the broiled octopus super tender excellent service  server was on point all time  desserts are awesome have become a regular and love it favorite flavor flavor are mango and thai snow smoothielove this place friendly staff quick service good music great atmosphere to work or hang my personal goto is the fedora frittata and an iced mocha awesome place the atmosphere of this market is great the outdoor patio area is really modern and pleasing and it overlooks the train tracks i ordered the hummus sandwich which was delicious i really liked how it came with a pickle and chips and the portion was rather large to where i wasnt hungry for dinnerso bring your appetite   the inside market has a wide selection of bottles of wine at what appeared to be decent prices they also sell frozen tamales and other delicious looking treats next time im in tucson this place is on the listamazing ambiance and flavorful aromatic coffee i

absolute delight and the sweetest everive come here two days in a row its that good i got the cookies and milk donut the first day and it was delicious not too sweet and very well fried outside with almost a crunch and the inside of the donut is fluffy and awesome 275 posttax for that the second day i got a glazed and a buttermilk drop each 165 posttax the buttermilk drop was really crispy on the outside but i could taste the oil a bit it was too fried i think inside was chewy like a cake donut which was good the glazed donut had an interesting taste to it still good consistency though

twisted iron brings it i order the bbq bacon cheeseburger waffle burger with a side of waffle fries and i must say it was well worth it the burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were nice and crispy i cant wait to come back and try there chicken and wafflestheir attention to providing many many yummy glutenfree options is a huge plus there are many places on the western main line to enjoy sunday brunch and em js is as good or better than most if not all the vast glutenfree alternatives puts them head above shoulders for those who must or choose to avoid gluten good job em jsive been going back and forth for a while trying to decide how to describe how wonderful elm is let me just say i am always over the top satisfied every time i am there   i would recommend trying coffee soup and a sandwich to get an idea of how great they arei discovered this bakery through yelp and everyone was on pointthe sweet bread from this panaderia is divine the actual bakery is clean bright and festivepinatas hanging from the ceilingit is right next to an ethinic market too it is marveous to find such a cute mexican bakery in nashville with courteous staff my friend and i were going bonkers while picking our breadthey had salvadorean quesadillasmy favorite brunch spot in tucson always the nicest servers and most unique food i havent found a brunch spot that balances sweet and savory like prep i have gotten the duck confit twice now which is saying something because before prep  pastry i had never tried duck before pro tip make sure you spring for a dossant its well worth iti love it when a plan comes together a few days before i tried pj subs my brother and i were talking about where to get a great sub in town we had given up on finding a good place the next day in a friends car i saw the sign i must have flown past many times but since i had subs on the brain it stuck this time i had to make a note to myself because i dont hangout at the corner of 6th  tucson as much as i use to back in the day not sure why its a perfectly good corner  i wasnt sure what door to enter didnt want to interrupt a mechanic in the middle of an autopay turns out no cars or car fumes just goodfriendly service  good food i had the roast beef on rye with a beer cant remember the name of cause this was a while ago   after some planning  rescheduling i was able to introduce my brother to pjs he liked it too as the little sister its nice to show my big brother a sub or 2i know what youre thinking youre thinking a 5 star review for a subway this guy cant be serious but in fact this particular subway provides a unique and memorable experience the restaurant is quite clean and i find the food to be on the nicer side of subway restaurants standard fare the chip selection is frankly magnificent the soda fountain and iced tea station are immaculate blah blah blah what youre really reading this for is my opinion of the angry man the other reviews of this subway complain about sure hes grumpy but i like to think of it like the seinfeld episode with the soup nazi its part of the experience and adds to its appeal and i certainly wouldnt let it sour my experience of choosing that perfect bag from the chip rack its a subway people and this ones as good as any   ps ive yet to meet a sandwich artist who had suggestions for perfecting my sandwich maybe all of those stellar and employees were forced to become location managers and thats why theyre so grumpy theyve got all these great sandwich ideas but now theyve gotta be a managerthis is our favorite goto date night location we tell all of our friends about hidden river  love the beer farmtotable food options and atmosphere staff is always so nice and helpful weve been here for drinks on the deck dinner and the ghost tours cant wait until the warmer weather really hits and we can lounge outside you guys are awesomewent here with 4 other people for our friends birthday and it was great our waitress was very

special fried green tomato sandwich my husband got the deluxe motherinlaw got french dip we also got a bacon pizza it was all good  the only thing i didnt like was the pasta salad sidehad too much olive flavor and i dont like olives so i guess if you like olives you may like it  wished i wasnt so ful as i would have liked to try the dessertsthe food was awesome and the service was warm and genuine i liked the coziness of the space parking was as easy as it gets with a parking lot in the back i never write reviews but i felt compelled to write this one because the food really was stellar try the zeppolis you will crave them every time you settle for a donuttotally blown away this place is amazing i thought it was going to be an average runofthemill type of place  but i was so wrong they make their sandwiches which the quality of the meat is so good on freshbaked waffles what a genius idea it all turns out beautiful i cant wait to try different things next timethey have many rare fruit and vegetables it is mindblowing everyone is very friendly as well everything we tried was super tasty and we tried a lots of products our refrigerator is full with exotic fruit and veggies cant wait to start eating and juicingwe came here as a recommendation from a friend who lived in nola this was by far one of the best places we stopped during our trip the iced vanilla latte was sooooooo good also the chicken salad was by far the best salad i have ever had luckily we stopped here on our way out of new orleans so i bought an extra one for the trip home thats how good it is my husband got a chocolate donut and breakfast taco and thought they both were super delicious we also bought a king cake to take home since we heard such good things about theirs whenever we come back to nola this will be one of our first stops its my new favorite coffee joint please think about expanding and opening up one in houston txweve eaten at every sushi place in reno this is the best weve had  the fish is really good and the rolls are very creative  the nevada and taimon rolls are insane    they also have great ice cream and dessert sushi that is outstanding  no wait no linesmy review of 121714 remains valid and true to fact  since my review in 2014 we have eaten breakfast here multiple times and it never fails to impress whether it be the breakfast itself or the delicious pastries  a hidden gemwow just wow this is a hidden gem that we stubbled across with amazing poboys while showing some out of town friends the area seriously the best little neighborhood joint with just yummy food i had the catfish mac and cheese and jambalaya super cheap and the owners are some of the nicest people ive ever met so sweet   fyi cash onlylove being able to stop in and order a juice or snack that i know is going to be super fresh large menu of different juices to accommodate any taste bud always clean staff is always friendly and willing to answer any question you may have must try frozen bananaburger up is one of my favorite restaurants in nashville  while in college i visited the one in 12th south pretty often  now that i live in franklin i go to the one in cool springs  same great food as 12 south but with more seating and less of a wait yes please the burgers are definitely one of my top favorite burgers i get the one topped with pimento cheese but i have tried a good bit of them  all are amazing the truffle fries are out of this world and their garlic aioli is absolutely delicious definitely one of my favorite meals in nashville  i even recommended it on my wedding website to guests from out of town to trywe went here in spite of terrible reviews and a friend claiming to have become sick after eating here the food and staff were both excellent we definitely plan to return again soonthe cashiers have always been friendly and the coffee is great ive come here every time i visit st pete and the shops are it are great to check outstarving after a night on the town needed protein for breakfast and these chicken fingers hit the spot light delicious breading and moist chicken cooked perfectlythis place was unreal the chips and queso were so warm and delicious the burrito i got with fried shrimp and cauliflower in it sounds weird but it was incredible the food was so flavorful and such a good mix of tastes the churros were to die for the staff were all super friendly and nice if you are looking for some amazing mexican food go herei used to go here for breakfast often when we lived in tucson now we make a point to go back when we visit and i am always happy with their breakfasts weve loved everything on the breakfast menu but my favorite is still the fresh herbs omelette service is usually good even when theyre busy i love how there is indoor and outdoor seating we have never been for dinner but i have had lunch there beautiful salad a terrific locallyowned restaurantsantorini greek island grill is the best place to eat on the ucsb campus  the food is fresh wellprepared and delicious  the staff is efficient courteous and friendly eg they call you my friend  the menu is interesting varied and contains many healthy options i like the chicken pita meal  the place is wellmanaged and you can see that everyone there takes pride in what they do  the prices are reasonable  these are some of the reasons i have been a loyal customer for the last two years and why i plan to continue coming to santorinis for lunch in the futuregreat fresh food and gracious service amazingly quickly we will definitely return soon recipes are so much better than most thai places we have visited  with beautifully served fresh dishes from appetizers through entreesthough im personally not a huge bud or domestic beer for that matter fan theres not a lot you can complain about a free informative tour and free beer and not just any ol bud but a variety of specialty beers that you cant find anywhere else the clydesdales and dalmatians are the best part of the tour be sure to stop by their impressive gift shop to pick up some souvenirs  bottom line when in rome do as the romans do so when in st louis make a stop off at anheuserbusch brewery and grab a bud like a good midwesterner i can not say enough great things about this place we sat at the bar and met the owner who was very friendly and wine knowledgeable the food was delish with generous portions the beer cheese is an absolute must we will definitely be backhad lunch here twice while visiting new orleans food was amazing both times had the filet mignon udon and honey glazed pork roll banh mi would definitely come back if visiting new orleans againgreat food definitely will continue to go there actually about to order from there today grilled cheesesteak was great but my gf had the steak and shrimp quesadilla that was huge and real goodthis is an absolute must visit  everything about this place is damn near phenomenal  the food is fresh and clean you can tell it hasnt been frozen or sitting in a fridge  the service is great all of the employees there are friendly and helpful i can barely pronounce perform correctly  they have a lot of glutenfree and vegetarian options which is nicei just love to dispel a trend of bad reviews we stopped in at this del taco despite a series of bad reviews and we are glad we did we wanted to try their fish taco special at two for three bucks we were not expecting much first lets discuss the product the fish fillet was about the size of a wiener cut in two a little on the smallish size it was wrapped in two small corn tortillas tasted greatnot greasy beer battered special price so i bought six for a total of nine bucks we were stuffed     lets talk about the wait help in this case trent what a jewel a tremendous asset to any business he welcomed us quickly and efficiently a tittle talkative but in a very good way the tables were cleanthe food served quickly and tasty five stars for sureamazing wine tour   my boyfriend and i took this tour on a weekday in between christmas and new years we specifically picked this tour for the added education value aside from learning the basics about wine tasting you also get to venture into the vineyards where you learn about the planting growing and harvesting of the grape as well as seeing behind the scenes of the fermentation and bottling process our tour guide antonio was wonderful personable and full of knowledge about the history of santa barbara and wine in the area top notch host that made the experience that much more enjoyable    i would highly recommend this all day delicious edventuremy husband and i ate here today  i ordered the blt with avocadoit was so delicious  my husband ordered the chili cheese hamburgerthe portion was huge  the best thing about this cafe is the french fries  these are homemade fries that are so delicious  we didnt get a milkshake because we couldnt eat another bite  they looked so good  next time we will get one meal and share a shakethis place is amazing everyone who works here is very personable they make you feel like family the food is fantastic the pizza is probably the best in town to completely honest and now they have an awesome choice craft beers and wine to choose from whats not to love about this place highly recommended if your looking for a place to relaxthe little deli belongs in little italy wonderful subs pastas desserts and deli items top notch subs  always busy so dont be a douche and give a 1 star review because your delivery took too long call ahead for pick up after coworkers see you eating anything from here they will want in next time you goa high class sushi bar hot pot station and if youd like to cook your own thinly sliced ribs the japanese cuisine is here i was craving buckwheat noodle and knew it was served here a little expensive but worth every pennythis truck came to my place of work and i am so glad the mustard bbq sauce is great and goes great with the sausage which was cooked with a great crust and flavor the owner is very personable and makes all of his own sauces which are all delicious  thanks and keep it upgood customer service and excellent pricing for good quality food the avocado toast was delicious i will definitely come back hereamazing creamery  a great selection of flavors   i sampled a variety of flavors before i had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat my friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops 4 flavors for 5 or 6 flavors for 7 and was able to try so many flavors i ended up with two delicious flavors  red velvet and strawberry sangria in a waffle cone   the decor was super cute chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion and hand made drawings were dangled about the fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air really riles up the sweet tooth in a person   noteworthy flavors  creole cream cheese cheesy vanilla goodness  champagne violet really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral  red velvet cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout  strawberry sangria fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form  pop tastes like strawberry cream sodaconvenient and delicious this place is so close and we never knew it was there   my wife and i ordered the meat and veggie lasagna which was enough for 2 big meals for each of us and then some it was really good we got the take and bake and it was ready in an hour in the oven and we heated the sauce in the microwave well be backi had the salted caramel donut and it was so delicious soft fresh and sweet i also tried the pork belly slider and it was soooo delicious i wish i had one right now it had a wonderful combination of flavors and wonderful dressing   i was also able to see how they prepare their dish and it was nice to see all of the fresh ingredients they usedi never knew what indian was until i ate here the food is crazy delicious since eating at palace of asia ive tried other indian restaurants palace is by far the best the atmosphere is classy quiet and enjoyable even on a friday or saturday night the service is fabulous i asked for my food to be very mild and that is no problem for them i think their favorite thing to say is no problem if youve never eaten indian food order the chicken tikka masala trust me also best rice ever also try their mango drink this is my restaurant of choicewe went to the depot last saturday around 830 pm and most of the crowd was outside we went straight for the bar and settled there we my husband and i each had a beer flight which is my favorite way of exploring what the establishment has on tap the place is really cool overall if i had to point out something it would be the lightning if far to bright to be a bar but thats just methanks goodness for pacific health foods in carp whether its popping in for a smoothie  or getting all my grocery needs fufilled  from fresh products including organic chicken and eggs chips oils vitamens and other health aids this place is great plus nathan is always very helpful  and if they dont have something i am looking for they will usually order ithad an absolutely lovely dinner with my family chicken tikka chana masala samosas alogobi garlic naan this was excellent service was great really great meal and service was very good excellent evening would totally recommend great meal experiencei have been here a bunch of times its always cleanservice is quick and the food is fresh  this is the only subway i like to go to for these reasonsamazing food if money were no object would eat here every night cant go wrong with anything on the menu the seafood stew is unique and deliciousseriously the best breakfast i have had in a long time it is pricey but everything here in sb is  breakfast bun choc croissant and the yogurt dear jesus excellent cappuccino as well  go there nowthis place is pretty much perfect we go here whenever we are downtown and want to get coffee the coffee is pretty good they do espresso it is verve ive read but theyre starting to roast themselves thats cool the service and people are nice and the vibe is mellow  i landed at the french press once after being away from santa barbara for awhile i remember sitting at one of their sunny steel tables outside pretty dogs and santa barbarans abounded i sat yesterday on one of their bar seats facing the allwindow front a diorama of pleasantville spread out before me every bit of sunshine and view i took in was assuring me everything is alright things are good here and so it is i hope the french press keeps the vibehow can i not rate this 5 stars its free  they give you a little tour the guy was funny i pet a clydesdale horse and got a little free cup of beer and a free 16 ounce beer of my choice of which there were many choices  not just budbud light we waited maybe 40 minutes for the tour to begin meaning we walked in went to the desk and the next tour that had openings was in 40 minutes   now it was a busy saturday and i think our tour group was too large and some of the tour got maybe left off so maybe go earlier or go during the week still a great tour and some beers nice facility well be back  ok that being said they have tours that cost money that are more indepth but i was specifically referring to the complimentary tourthis tour was awesome marianne was a great guide giving us a good overlay of the city and its history you can tell she loves her city which made us love it too definitely recommendupon arriving we decided that we might be better off to order at the takeout window and sit at nearby picnic tables on the pier this is a great option if the line happens to be long the location is lovely and offers traditional seafood options the crab cakes are amazing like maybe the best i have ever had and the staff was so friendly and helpful really greatthe service here is outstanding and done with a smile the salmon cakes are cooked to perfection the way youd remember from your parents kitchen if you grew up in the south this is a great place to come for breakfast or anytime the decor is very tasteful and the bar area is very classy a great gem in st petethis is my very first time and i have to say the mexican mocha is super good and chocolatey but packs quite a spice thats how delicious it is i will be definitely coming back since it is the bang for the buck and it is an awesome place to get coffee and some studying doneexcellent got there just before they sold out for the day well worth itthe staff is wonderful the coffee is great and the concept is different an indonesian cafe right in the heart of fishtownawesome place   i wish i had one closer to where i live homemade italian breads and desserts in all different shapes and sizes   great subs and pizza great place a must stoplove ajs they have the best strawberry lemonade around town and all theyre baked goods and hot plates are delicious if i could id go here more often great selection storewide of things you dont often find in other supermarketsi went here with five friends after dinner on my birthday  initially there were no tables or seats available but after looking at the extensive cocktail menu we decided to stay for at least a drink even if we had to stand  while we were choosing drinks two separate servers came by to tell us there would be a table available soon and that theyd get it cleared right away    the pumpkin pie martini was on special  one of my friends ordered it and several others tried it and they all agreed that it was delicious first i had the ultimate chocolate martini which was superb  the rim was chocolatealmost like magic shell before it hardens  i followed it up with an almond joy martini  it was also fantastic  it had a perfect coconutchocolate balance and a whipped cream rim  im guessing they were about 400 calories each but so worth it   the staff were super nice and the drinks were scrumptious  i would definitely go here again for fancy cocktailsi have only been to the brewery to pick up beer for releases today was my first time sitting down and grabbing a beer the brewery makes some outstanding beers and are always looking to make an imprint on the craft beer scene in st louis during the warmer they have a great patio to sit drink and play games   its one of the great breweries in st louis so if you are around check it outthe best ice cream ever so fresh and full of flavor not to mention super cool how they make the rolled ice cream will be a stop every time im in townthis delightful dining spot is perched at the very end of stearns wharf with magnificent views of the islands bobbing in the sea a short distance away quite by chance we chose the perfect time to dine here and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline with the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal it was late in the day and having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing we were ravenous so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense new england style clam chowder we followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels served in a white wine and garlic broth every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty french bread and then splitting an order of calamari sauteed in butter garlic white wine and sundried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini including tax and tip we stuffed ourselves for only 1700 each the very nautical decor and bustling openair kitchen add to your dining enjoyment theres a long bar where food is also served that seats a couple of dozen and a massive aquarium  with water pumped up from the ocean below  houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters other waterfront spots in santa barbara easily will cost twice as much for a far less satisfying meal if youre looking for seafood this is the place to eat while in townso good everything home made everything ive tried is delicious and really good drinks and pastries highly recommend i work at supercuts next to jeannines and last week a worker from here delivered a box of bundtinis as a promotion and they were absolutely to die for they were so moist and delicious love love loved itabsolute best breakfast spot on magazine and maybe in the whole city this trendy little spot has amazing donuts delicious waffle fries and honestly the best little salad you will ever have the staff is quirky and friendly their instagram is awesome and i often wake up and check the donut flavors of the day a mustwe absolutely love this place toto treats us like vips and takes incredible care to make sure we get what we want a perfect end to any nashville nightstaying here every year while in new orleans beautiful scenery clean and safe they have a wonderful breakfast every morning staff is so kind and attentive this hotel has so much history wouldnt stay anywhere elsei go to this subway once a week the people who work in here have been her for years and really know how to load a sub up with everything you like the place is always clean and the folks are friendly best subway aroundhenrys is the kind of place you want to keep to yourself for fear of it becoming so crowded you cant ever find a seat   great atmosphere great coffee great service  beats sbucks by a mile  i like to go by myself and people watch or go with a friend to play scrabble and chit chat  the food is excellent as well so its a great stop for lunch or an after dinner  treat  highly recdthe best donuts that we have witnessed in more than 8 north american states  price are very cheap with respect to their size without being queasy  the cinnamon sugar is just perfect with subtle taste its the same for the glazed one dont hesitate to go theremy office building is right off of 20th and market so this is the perfect lunch spot for me  like others before me have stated the wait can be long but i usually get around that by opting for a later lunch on days that i choose to eat from the falafel truck 100 is usually perfect   some people are offended by konstadinos rules but really i appreciate them the fact that there isnt a menu is exciting i like not knowing exactly what im going to get but maybe im more adventurous than some people really though its not even like he switches things up that much he just tweaks the details a bit the chicken is always on the platter there is always falafel and there is always hummus the dessert salad and the chickpea saladricewhatever is all that really changes  and i also appreciate that he doesnt let you hold a spot for someone or order more than one platter he realizes that most of his clientele are working folks that are on tight schedules   if youre lucky you might catch him on a good day and hell throw in a free drink its only happened to me once or twice but still a nice little perk and if it happens to be cold outrainy out he sometimes offers soup while you wait   as far as comparing him to mamas i do enjoy mamas but the falafel truck takes the cake in my opinion  its 10 well spent especially since i usually get two meals out of it just be prepared for some serious lingering garlic breathtook husband to maynards on a spontaneous birthday dinner trip ended up ordering off of the happy hour menu steak tartare mussels and poutine each was 7 and more than enough for two people excellent food quality excellent service will come back to try more of their happy hour menuwait in line for pancakes  seriously yes  the pancakes are amazing and the service was excellent too     you have to gogood food and very good prices service is fast and professional every time they do the best lettuce wrap job of any other burger place but youd better like lettuce because theyre generous with itupdate 1124  okay this is the best coffeeshop in town period i have switched jobs but not my coffeeshop so that is something also i ordered an eggless cake from them and it was heavenly not many places can claim that in this city  this is what you need to do go to the farmers markets on girod and magazine early on saturday then head over for waffles or a bagel or both you will thank me later   its my regular place for coffee and bagel and it is one of the awesome places in the neighborhood to get both of them   the staff is superfriendly shout out to cheryl andy linda and everyone   regular plain bagel plain creamcheese and americano with 2shots regular you cant miss yogurt perfect parfait  must try dark chocolates or any chocolates reallybest gelato we have ever had the staff is always friendly and courteous very creative and delicious combo of ingredients they have flavor combo you will not get anywhere else never had a flavor that was not perfection the bubble gum has hard gum balls i would caution for kids the dark chocolate is to die for combined with a fruit of your liking it was just amazingfair grinds coffee house takes away all the feelings of distress at having to complete hours and hours of work and transforms it into a pleasurableor at least tolerable experience  it not only provides me with the space i need to focus and a good cup of coffee to help me stay awake and motivated but unlike other coffee houses it actually offers a great atmosphere and vibe i always feel extremely cozy and positive in the space books on the bookshelves art on the walls dimmed lights and colors all around are just some of characteristics that create a wonderful ambiance    it truly is a local coffee house like no other and i love all of it best of all its in my lovely mid city neighborhood   i am going to make it a point to visit more ofteni was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in boise for work spent my free time drinking my way around boises great craft beer scene i visited about 10 breweries or brewpubs and payette was far and away my fav tons of beers on tap i would guess probably 30 fun custom 4 beer flights and cheap too like hard to believe cheap beautiful building and space no food but on both of my visits they had a food truck parked outside great vibe oh yeah and most importantly the beer is excellentid thought about going somewhere else but when the line was an hour damn that must be good and a starving stomach i made my way to howies and boy i wasnt disappointed i got the bbq chicken and devoured the whole thing im not from the tucson area but when i come back through ill grab a slice of pie heredelicious we came during our vacation with 4 adults and 5 kids under 7 years old called ahead and they set up a table for us the food was amazing adults had the chicken sandwich pork sandwich and papousa and everyone walked out full and happy kiddos shared burgers and mac and cheese and loved it too all the sauces are handmade fresh beer and spirits breweddistilled there and they are yummy well be swinging by to take some home with us atmosphere is great as the building is an old train stationanother outstanding doughnut shop in st louis large selection of some of the best in the city the apple fritter here is the winner but you cant really go wrong one of my favourite things about this place is that it is open almost all of the time so you dont need to get there before midday most days to get your fill  its also next to both ted drewes if youre a fan im pretty ambivalent about ted drewes its fine but no more and the excellent aya sofia so if you really want to pig out this is a good part of town to be ingreat service and really cool event space we had a wonderful time at the art show so many very talented peoplei drive the distance to have lunch here  seriously  this is the most satisfying lunch in boise to me  a large bowl of pho a bbq pork sammy togo for later in the afternoon a vietnamese coffee with boba  man o  man the best i have made this a lunch staple about 50 times over  the only time i have been a little disappointed is when they ran out of basil for the pho   they also need to make sure their bathroom is a little cleaner i have had pho in boise in about 5 other locations  this place has the best broth handsdownmost towns have a good little donut place in the case of bridgeport thats suzyjo  i havent found any other places as good in the area so its worth a visit if youre in kop or norristown  my personal favorite is their cream stick  the cinnamon twist and apple fritter are also worth the drive  i try not to stop in frequently but its always a treat when i do  the people who work here are also very friendly  just a good oldfashioned local business with quality donutsfood was delicious and of great quality although it was a smaller menu the coffee is served in a togo cup and bottomless for 3 the seating area is smaller and there is a larger communitystyled table the staff was all so polite and helpfulloved the atmosphere and the coffee pulled off 101 looking for a snack but when a coffee lover sees a place called french press i had to detour lol i guess you could call me a pesky customer i had a lot of questions before i selected which coffee i was buying which were all cheerfully answered i was intrigued by their cold brew and the batista explained process and taste and offered me a sample love the customer service thanks guys  between my group i tried 2 blends of coffee one french pressed one espresso and the tres leches coffee which was unique and yummy i suggest trying it its sweet and creamy but not enough to take away from the coffees flavor  if i lived in the santa barbara area id likely become a regular i went to the new location on 806 east hillsborough ave the food and staff were awesome i will be back soon  oftengreat experience great food completely gluten free visited with our 3 small children who enjoyed their kids pail chicken veggie rice avocado and smoothie i had the patagonia bowl steak quinoa corn tomatoes and my wife enjoyed a southwest salad highly recommend also it was located right next to our hotel which was plusi dont get over here nearly enough this might be the smallest brewery in new jersey but its also the friendliest chris and his wife are outstanding hosts oh yeah and the beer is just awesomewow  this spot in conshy has great coffee outstanding interior for work or study and friendly baristas  kills starbucks by a mile  trade up and go localbeautiful architecture free tour free drinks  a lot of history  nice place to visitone of the best steaks ive ever had granted you can find an equivalent steak for the half the price but what youre paying for here is atmosphere and elegance id suggest dulingkurtz as a meal for a special occasion   the breadturnovers they serve before you receive your meal are mouth watering the turnovers are served with your choice of butter or house made lemon curd a truly unique taste  the steak as mentioned above was superb served with a peppercorn crust and drizzle the taste is something ill never forget served with garlic parmesan french fries with garlic aioli and grilled asparagus the only entree that is served with fries  excuse me frites at restaurants like dulingkurtz we call them frites god dammit    everything was phenomenal dont come here expecting to pennypinch youre going to overpay for anything and everything but youll be satisfied with taste and experiencevery cool place the food is fresh and delicious and the donuts are so unique and seriously good i have had the fried chicken sandwich as well as the burger sliders and both have been divine highly recommendi chose delicious designs based on the excellent reviews i found on yelp and i am so very pleased with the results leigh anne kept in constant contact with me about details and the end result was fabulous of course i had a special requestthats why i chose to do some investigating the comments people make mean alot to me and i am very happy that she was able to make and deliver my special cake which was a law book with a gavel and tassle typically meant for a law students graduation but we used it to celebrate an attorneys 40 year anniversary everyone loved it and asked who made it so a polite suggestion leigh anne when you make cakes from now on turn it in with a few of your business cards so that the host can hand out your card when people want to know who made it ours was white cake with fresh strawberries in a strawberry mousse filling it was delicious thank you so much for all your hard work you will be hearing from me againi loved the poke bowl they allow for a lot of customization and you can get pretty much unlimited toppings but the serving is smaaalll i got the large and it definitely doesnt seem large but that could be just my perspective from spending too much time eating at american restaurantsgreat food for a great price my favorite place to eat in reno also if you are a bobabubble tea connoisseur like myself they have great optionsawesome awesome awesome the fudgery in the riverside nola outlet next to the hilton nola riverside was a new treat for me personally when i went to look at the goodies that they had to offer i wanted a particular type of candy apple once again touching on my inner child  to see what that story is about check out my review on the popcorn bistro   what was a blessing and displayed an essence of true customer service was how the ladies kristeon joseph and simmeon bazile went the extra mile and create a candy apple created especially for me i was soooo elated my inner child was cheezzing that others wanted to see why i was so happy and was slowing down to take a peak as well   i cant wait to taste the deliciousness of the candy apple i had carmel almonds with a drizzle of chocolate which was their special touch added i am at such a sugar rush with having had the beignets yesterday that i must pace myself   ok nola now i need to go home and go back on my programmed eating because you fulfilled my inner child desires thanks and see you again soonupdate weve returned several times since my original postrenovation review the service has been more efficient and ive bumped it back up to a 5  this is the older post  the renovation is lovely the coffee still the same but its 330 with the craft fair going on at rittenhouse and lacolombe has the most inefficient team working the bar incredibly inefficient and kind of scattered   the line which usually moves really quickly just crawled  i usually get a sidecar iced coffee this time the espresso sidecar was filled nearly to the top of the glass  it is usually just a halfinchczerws kielbasy was amazing  the neighborhood alone was a highlight  never having been to poland it was filled with polish businesses and establishments of all kinds  several delicious bakeries in the area as well  at czerws we ordered 5 dozen pirogis broccolicheddar potatocheese baconchivepotato kraut and one other kielbasas a few sausages and kraut everything was spectacular  we had four people trying them and it fed us for two whole days  best pirogis ive had sorry to my 2 polish grandmothers and a very warm and cheery atmosphere  the gentleman who served us was extremely happy and helpful  now that i know about this gem i will forever stop when i drive by phillyin fact ill go out of my way to drive by phillyi can eat sweets like no other and ive eaten them all over the world even at well known bakeries and ive come to realize that im lucky the flying cupcake is here in indy and that their cupcakes consistently make me happy their cupcakes are some of the best ive had and i havent had one i didnt enjoy either the cupcakes are large and reasonably priced sometimes im bad and i can eat a whole cupcake sometimes two in one sitting fatgirlheart but theyre definitely large enough to share the frosting to cupcake is at a good ratio while i love them all some of my favorites are the red velvet elvis auf wiedersehen pretty in pink and pucker up they have some vegan options and seasonal cupcakes as well if you ever get distracted by the bits and bobs they have in store please take a moment and admire how freaking cute and adorable they are the stores are usually clean and there are a couple small tables for you and a friend to dine in service has always been friendlyamazing cupcakes great price friendly service fun atmosphere  we tried the strawberry cream  mango passionfruit cupcakes  best cupcakes ive ever hadthis is a great place for breakfast i had the oyster benedict holy cow so delish the staff was super attentive they were ready to have a go cup for water coffee or other beverageswith over 300 reviews and 4 stars i had to try this place while at a conference in nashville  my coworker and i took two buses to get there  thankfully it was a weekday and it was a bit later in the morning so they sat us within 5 minutes of arriving   i promised my husband who stayed back in ca that i would try the sweet potato pancakes as he is a huge fan of everything sweet potato i for one was hesitant  man was it delicous it lived up to the hype the cinnamon cream syrupooh the syrupwow i mean wow it was orgasmic i mean really i didnt know food could make a grown adult cry as i ate my pancakes i wondered when i would return to eat this yummy nectar of the gods i knew i would have to return with my husbandwho didnt think nashville had anything good to offer which is why he stayed behindboy oh boy was he mistaken nashville has delicious food  if i knew that the syrup was that good and that they didnt sell it i would have take a big purse with mebeware pancake pantry staff i will return to take a bottle home with me   the ham was fantastic too  the service was quick and efficient as soon as guests leave ninjas come from no where to clean the tables the wait staff is friendly and they dont rush you   the area has some cute shops you should definitely check outyummy pizza and friendly service we also had a steak stromboli kind of like a cheesesteak all of it was delicious quicker and easier than fast food all while supporting localfun clean classy moderately priced good looking crown and amazing food and service zero complaints livery is my immediate go to for me my crew and family  go there nowunbelievably delicious  hubs and i stopped in st charles to crash with a friend on our crosscountry road trip back from our honeymoon and the goal was to get bbq in every city where we dined  this was by far the best experience we had we sidled up to the bar and loved seeing the old rusty butchersknife tap handles  the bartender was friendly greeted and talked with us for a while recommended a couple of local beers all the ones on tap are local craft and we ordered some specials to go we drank the beers while we waited and they were delicious the wait by the way was almost nonexistent they had our food out to us in i think less than 7 minutes  i got the texasstyle brisket on special with a side of sweet potato casserole andi honestly cant remember the other side because that one was so bomb as were the ones with dhs meal  dh got the picktwo with sausage and pulled pork sides of cheesy grits and baconbraised greens  holy moly it was all so mouthwatering that i wanted to inhale it portions were huge too so we had plenty left over for breakfast omelets in the morning thrilled that we made this awesome decision in our brief 12hour visit to st charles can hardly wait to visit this place againmy husband and i loved this quaint donut and yep slider restaurant  we stumbled across the first night we were in nola  we wanted a light night snack  their donuts are amazing  they are cake like donuts  very dense but delicious  we were there during mardi gras so they had a king cake donut  just awesome  also we had the sweet and salty  carmel and pretzel dipped chocolateyum  a couple of days later we went back to try the sliders they did not disappoint perfect and the waffle fries were excellent  you could add cheese if you wanted i wanted but my husband didnti lost   highly recommendi come to cucina zapata way more than i should what can i say their food is absolutely delicious it most certainly isnt what youd expect from a typical food truck with their flavor packed menu my favorite things to get are the capn crunch tilapia burrito and their chicken katsu portions are enough to fill me up on my lunch break and i always leave satisfied with a tasty meal and a full stomach  around noon is when they are busiest which when youll likely have to wait quite a bit longer than usual but to be honest their food is worth it my typical order is the chicken katsu with an egg on top it comes with a nicely crunched chicken fillet on a bed of rice with some avocado and salads on the side along with the option to make it spicy or not i personally put spicy mayo everything is freshly made each day and you can definitely taste it when you dig in   the workers there are extremely sociable and always greet you with a smile and they seem like they enjoy serving their customers this truck will keep me coming for the remainder of my time at drexel  best things to get  chicken

the danny boy family my son request the mac and cheese daily great for dogs kids and adults wonderful all aroundthis was a great tour if the factory and its free  it takes about one hour and is very neat after the tour they give  you a few beers  free beer is always goodbring me all the beers thats what i want to say when i come here i always feel like the bartender is getting impatient because he doesnt think i know anything about beer but its really because i love belgian beers dark beers german beersi love the beer they have here and it tears my heart out to choose i agonize over my beer choice because they all sound and probably are so awesome   the food is really good too ive had the cuban sandwich pretzels bratwurst and something else and considered licking the wax paper to get the last morsels sweet little patio overlooking the street and indoors seating too dont let the various doors confuse you there are multiple rooms inside so they need several doors havent been for a movie or music yet but look forward to itof course the chicken is delicious but its the customer service that gets the 5star rating suffering from allergies wasnt enough to keep my wonderful cashier with interesting colored hair sorry i didnt get her name from striking up a good conversation about the neighborhood while i waiting for my chicken it was refreshing as opposed to the typical order and wait while idly surfing the internet on my phone hopefully she gets her tips back from the thief that stole them from the jar saturday cause she deserves themwithout question the best bagels in the st petersburg area and the newly introduced cronuts are fantastic st pete bagels have become a weekly habitdefinitely the best chinese delivery place in the area  i like to order basically the same stuff every time pork fried rice and its terrific the wife regularly tries out all the other dishes and has never had a bad thing to say  only knock i have is that they dont take discovercame here for the first time yesterday and i had their spot burger and cheese fries best burgers and cheese fries are not cheese from a can super fresh and juicy and amazing customer service  very clean inside will be returningloved this place i had the cheeseburger slider and the chicken slider and they were delicious my favorite was the chicken service was fast and the staff was nice the doughnuts are huge i couldnt even finish one definitely recommendi tried the cinnamon bun brle it was awesome i would recommend that you heat it up if youre getting it takes this treat to a whoooooole notha level my friends im a fan of the variety district donuts offers on a daily basislove love love tropiccool not only can you get gelato on a stick dipped in chocolate now they serve waffle cones too  check it out if you are in st petei had been wanting to go here since it opened and i finally made it thankfully yelp has the new handy reservation feature and i was able to make a reservation from the app just 30 min from when i looked that gave me enough time to jump in the car and make it for my reservation so simple and super useful on a saturday night  first off the modern decor inside the historical building makes for lots of easy conversation there are some really cool old city planning maps and trendy butcher block table tops i loved everything about it   i also loved that when i sat down some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered they are so tasty and have the perfect amount of jalapeo kick balanced with a bourbon honey sauce   the cocktail menu is definitely worth making a couple visits for i got an albees knees and it was the bees knees im not usually a fan of gin but this cocktail was delicious  we ordered an artichoke cheese and kale dip appetizer it was heavenly i would go back exclusively for the dip it was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer   i couldnt decide what to order for dinner but landed on the shrimp tacos and was happy with my decision the corn tortillas were very crispy almost tostada like and the spicy slaw and cojita was perfect i would definitely order them again  i was too full to try any dessert so im going to have to come back the mac and cheese bites are also calling to me so it wont be longif youre looking for a glitzy restaurant chain with a bunch of simulated ethnic dishes keep looking this is the real deal only thing close ive found is in miami had a cuban sandwich picky wife had a turkey with cream cheese and strawberry preserves sounds weird but excellent the best ive had north of dade county gonna be a regular stop when in indy gotta like it when the cook comes out and asks how you liked it   the unknown diner digs itlove this place i will return when we come back to nashville we maybe waited 10 minutes outside and that was it we got  in and out in about an hour food was amazing they service was greatgrowing up i lived right by donut drivein  wed go every week after church and my sister and i would fight over the sprinkle donuts or the blueberry iced donuts  having moved back to st louis recently i forgot all about this place until one day my husband said wow that place looks old and i said well go there some weekend it took a few weeks but finally we were in the area so i got a dozen donuts for breakfastheaven  i went in and picked out the donuts and it was like my entire youth flooding backthey havent changed a bit which is comforting and also it makes senseif it aint broke dont fix it  my personal favorite is the french cruller with chocolate icing  tastes just like i remember although the custard with powdered sugar is a close second    it was packed when i went inside but it took no time at all to get my box o donuts  donut drivein dont ever changean amazing place to eat love it you could go 100 times and never eat the same thing twice fresh bakery deli pasta cheese  wine room butcher coffee bar amazing sandwichesi was visiting nola from brooklyn ny for the weekend when searching online for vegan restaurants i read about cafe bamboo i had a good feeling about this place and i gotta say it was incredible my cousin and i shared collard green wraps sol chickn dinner and bourbon chickn dinner not red bamboo the owners inspiration or any other comprable spot in nyc compares to the taste of that soul food the bourbon chickn was inspirational excellent dessert the atmosphere was very relaxing and pleasant i even went back for breakfast before my flight on monday do not visit nola without visiting this restaurant  veganbluescomhad this local icon recommended to us while eating dinner nearby the concretes were incredible  enjoythis place is a favourite of mine in the fairmountfrancisvilletemple area got the turkey goat cheese baguette sandwich and the lady had the philly baguette sandwich lox and cream cheese w tomato food was delicious iced tea and iced chai latte were both amazing as well cute outdoor seating everything was super clean and tidy and the staff was super friendly highly recommended for a late breakfast or light lunchone of my favorite breakfast places to eat love local food thank you for excellent customer service every time we gowow we had the pleasure of one of the best dinning experiences in a very long time  i travel a lot and eat out 80 of the time so i am exposed to many types of dinning scenarios   we sat at the upper bar and had drinks and dinner  lets start with the staff incredible  we interacted with two bar tenders and a few other staff all were extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their role in the org  you can tell that the owners treat and train everyone at a high level   lets get to the food and drink  we had the brussels sprouts and yuca fries to start  both outstanding then we ordered the paella cauliflower and canelones  everything was fresh with unique flavor  the pickled fresno peppers were so good the staff gave me a tub to take home  and because we asked so many questions we were given a tour of the kitchen to meet the chief  thats a first  the beer and drinks were on par with the food  i have zero negatives and will be backi dont eat a lot of meat but when i have a dinner party and need something or want to try a new recipe i go here  last night i wanted to get a bone for my dogs birthday i left work early in hopes of making it in time i live around the corner but work in west philly i arrived and they were closed all dark and closed up so i decided to call and see if someone answered perhaps in the back cleaning up so someone did answer and the gentleman said you just need a bone and i said yes he said ill be right there he let me in and i got my birthday bone i thought that was really nice  the men that sell are super nice always pleasant my only complaint would be that you never know who is in line but that seems to be the south philly waythis has to be some of the best everything i ate here so far mexican food in the tucson area for coming out of a little taco cart man they know how to do it right i know its practically fighting words in this town but id venture to say el nene is up there for best sonoran dog in tucson the bacon on the hot dog is really what shines perfectly crispy with just enough blackened ends to lend the dog that bit of smoke it needs   note this place is cash only  i made that mistake the first time my friend and i ventured from across town eagerly awaiting our chance to try some of the carne asada and famous sonoran dogs only to realize they didnt take cards also i wasnt aware but apparently they won almost won some national contest for best hot dog on a food show of some sort pretty cool   we finally arrived at el nenes prepared cash in hand and ready to go i think there is an atm next door but im principled when it comes to atm fees i got a sonoran hot dog and a few different types of tacos first cabeza is my favorite type taco meat and el nenes does it very well slow cooked juicy succulent a little fatty but i like it that way if you havent ever try the cabeza   now the carne asada some of the best ive ever had to be sure they cook it on a smokey grill out back you can see it when youre pulling up to park behind the tent the smoked lime flavor and tenderness of the steak is perfect they also have plenty of salsas and toppings on their salsa bar to add some zest anyway you see fit tacos also come in varying forms of soft or crispiness i had both a tacos dorados and a regular soft taco i have to say the dorado was the better of the two the deep fried corn shell was perfectly well done   for a little taco cart on a corner in the flowing wells neighborhood i am seriously impressed this is fresh cooked nobologna ready to order authentic mexican food i highly recommend giving it a tryif you want real cantonesestyle chinese food this is the place to go in st louis  if you move away from the fake chinese food everything here is excellent  my parents who are cantonese insist on going here every time they come to visit    almost all dishes are under 10 so not sure what some of the other reviewers may have ordered  and you are almost certain to have leftovers because of the good quantity of food in each order which makes this a great deal  service is sometimes hit or miss as the core family works there and they seem to hire folks on an off to help as needed  but that is made up for by the excellent fooddave takes an all american favorite and transforms it into a delectable experience we ordered a daves style and ended up with 3 more love theses dogs great service and friendly smileseven though im 2000 miles away and have perfectly good ice cream stores all around i still lie awake at night thinking about creole creamerys butterscotch toffee lavender and red velvet cake ice creams  the texture of the ice cream here is thick and creamy and luscious and the choices are endless its a good place to hang out with some friends and try each others concoctions  open a location in california pleasesecond visit in one week cupcakes are tasty and very reasonable moist and delightful only surprise was the price changed up on the cannoli cupcake which was a lil bit of a shock but still reasonable   will definitely be going againamazing food and cheap the staff was very friendly the only minor complaint i would have is that it was pretty empty on a friday nightcookies are da bomb  i dont need to eat gluten free but if you do this place is amazingi haz mad love for this place which is absolutely the go to place if you fancy yourself a mixologist or an alcoholic and even if you arent an alcoholic they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff i had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today they have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint i had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which i was standing in front of sighing knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine a clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if i like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins i should try charles martini cab and a francis ford coppola blend both were amazing and sooo much better than what i had been drinking at about the same price point i had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than frugal mcdougals i also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and dont you judge me people some giant sippy bags of margaritas i dont know why they were on sale and it was pregame time of year as i stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt he said you know what these are good for and i shook my head to indicate not really he then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said  red lights with no cops around it was all the wrong so you know they are clearly my peoplewow just wow  the food was unbelievable  no photo since i scarfed it down before i thought to snap a picture  we got there just before noon and there were 34 people in line  allinall we were there a good 15 min  not bad  everything everyone said is absolutely true  so fresh so yummy  i was a little surprised that the ricechick pea dish was cold everything except the chicken and fallafel were but it was delish nonetheless  for 10 my platter included the most amazing smelling and tasting grilled chicken a rice and chick pea mixture hummus a small scoop of the best fruit salad ive ever eaten some sort of greens and a nice hunk of crusty bread i got the nose  ill definitely go back againdelicious food and outstanding service from josh he helped make my mothers day extra special by inviting my children to make the tableside guac for me  and my children now cant wait to go backsince it was our first time gigi let us sample from the menu we settled on the jerk chicken collared greens cabbage and rice the profile picture must be the small platter because we got the large and the food was piled so high the lid could barely close the second platter was for the kids fried chicken mac and cheese fries and candied yams that she threw in for free everything was delicious and more food than we could possibly eat  i enjoyed talking with gigi and learning her and her husbands back ground i loved this food truck and hope to return or visit their restaurantdont under rate this place because of its location in metairie i enjoyed the same experience as i did at the french quarter location its great for a social sit down with friends and the quality of beignets are equal in taste i ate two orders alonei have eaten pad kee mao drunken noodles at every thai restaurant in the city and i hereby declare that they are best at vientiane  fat noodles that are a tiny bit sweet and oh so spicy if you ask for them hot 14 stars  the staff here are just fantastic at making sure to ask you just how you like it and then delivering  i get my padkeemao 2 stars of spice out of 4  my boyfriend gets his red curry extra extra spicy andvery creative twist on a breakfast classic i love the staff as well as their creative donuts great little addition to the st louis restaurant scenethought of having another beer and stumbled across urban south discovered a crazy big industrial hall filled with parents and kids and also pets to adopt it looked like an event to me all benches were pretty much full it was thursday so they had the crabfish stand so we munched on that sooo yummy but also a bit to spicy for this german right here oh yeah they had beer too hahahaa the grapefruit ipa was the best to calm down my tongue great beer and great atmosphere loved itthis place has been open for 10 months but i just heard about it last weekend  the owner and his daughters are super friendly  the pricing is fair and the food portions are large    i dont eat pork which is what most of their sandwiches are made of  i got the pan con bistec steak sandwich which is probably bigger than a foot long sub and the black bean soup  both were very tasty and filling  i also tried a coconut and cream cheese pastry warm that was good  my friend got the elena ruth and was surprised by how good it tasted considering the seemingly odd mix of ingredients in the sandwich  so 2 sandwiches 2 cups of soup 2 drinks and a desert pastry came out to about 26  a fair price considering these were definitely dinner sized portions of food  they just got a new coffeeespresso machine and were letting us try free samples  the coffee is definitely good quality and better than what the barista with the green apron can make you down the street    we will definitely be repeat customers if you try this place you will be too  this is another great locally owned business in indianapolis  oh and the owner hinted that he would be starting to serve breakfast soonmy friends and i loved our tour our guide was toni and she was both wonderfully knowledgeable and highly engaging with great stories and a great sense of humor too we had a blast even though we went on a quite cold day ended up at historic city tavern where george and martha washington had a regular table and had a wonderful meal there to top the day off i highly recommend that as wellthis mom and pop grocery store has fresh fruits and veggies at a reasonable price my favorite thing about goekes is their herbs and spice section they have the largest selection i have ever seen and they even have custom blends for marinating and making dips and dressings if you are looking for healthy snacks they have containers of nuts and dried fruits all in all its a cool little storewhats not to love this place is actually laotion or food from laos which is why you may find dishes slightly different then vietnamese so first off the food is amazing and they are open late everyday until midnight on weekends and 10pm week days there is a shaved milk ice bar which is very good treat while you wait for food or after you eat its condensed milk on shaved ice with choice of many toppings from fresh fruits to weird jelly cubes there is also and fresh ban mi bar which is a pork sandwich with arrangement of toppings the staff is nice and decor is coolamazing service carol was friendly and very helpful the food was fresh and delicious felt like i was at home was moderately crowded but no wait for 2 to be seated would definitely recommend this restaurant to friendswe used the masters baker for our wedding cakeit was gorgeous and so moist and tasty  we got the lemon raspberry and vanilla creme cakes with raspberry filling and buttercream icing it was fantastic we got married 2 weeks ago and the cake is still moist and delicious any time we are close we stop in to get some cake tinsi just went for the first time and this place is amazing i tried the chicken sandwich and it was incredible hot crispy juicy tender and flavorful all at once i cant wait to try one of the donuts i might go back tomorrowprobably one of the best middle eastern  mediterranean foods he just piles it on and its just amazing the man knows how to work a cart  tip  you do not get to choose what you get only one item on the menu and its always a little different from the last time  long wait so get there early or later during lunch time  used to be 5 now its 10 i believe  one order per person  cash only  hes a warm friendly guy so have a conversation with him while he prepares your order  you will smell like the food you ate for the next day or two but its worth it  you will have food coma if you attempt to eat it all in one sitting  hes got piles of garlic and flowers on his cart which is cool  you can smell his food cart from a block awayi dont go there often but when i do i get the fox treat  best to go at odd times to avoid the linesgreat new brewery in the neighborhood took a while to open but glad its finally here very laid back place good service delish beeri love tanya  matts i work right around the corner and if it wouldnt make me weigh 800 lbs i would go every single day   they have an everchanging selection of flavors they have a smorgasbord of toppings that you can choose from including these tiny little juice ball things i havent tried them yet but they look really intriguing   ive had cookies and creme peanut butter and birthday cake they are all super creamy and delicious my favorite topping is the cookie dough chunks but they also have a bunch of great fresh fruit   they have boba tea smoothies and milkshakes but i havent tried those yet  i recommend going in the first time so you can check out the selection but they also have a drive thruwent to this place because of the reviews but definitely going back because of the hot dogs i started with a daves style and it was so good that i immediately went back up and got another hot dog with mustard it may not look like much but dave knows what hes doing   my husband got a pizza dog it had a delicious mozzarella cheese crust with pepperoni and marinara never thought of that but it was sooo goodswiss haus is my favorite bakery in philly all their treats are scrumptious  the coffee is excellent and the service is consistently friendly and helpful   i recommend the devils food mouse treat and the strawberry pond cakebest salty caramel i have ever had  you know i love you jeni your shits still splendid but boys in nola got you heregreat little unique place to check out good selection of cocktails and beer i tried the knickerbocker  rum raspberries and triple sec  it was delicious and strong  the food is very reasonably priced and delicious the cuban is wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed the st louis salad my only small complaint with the food was the royal grille sandwich the sandwich itself was great how they got mozzarella and cheddar to be that melty and delicious beats me so creamy the apples added a nice crunch and sweetness the bread was toasted perfectly however when paying an extra 2 for turkey to be added i expect more than one very thin slice i couldnt even taste or see the turkey without deconstructing the sandwich with that being said it was still a delicious sandwich   i think our servers name was andrew he was very friendly and attentive the drinks and food came quickly we were in and out during peak dinner hours on a weekend evening in just under an hour will definitely return when were in the arealove love love yolklore  cannot say enough good about this place  my friends family and i all stop by about once a week  unfailingly my favorite place to get biscuits and gravy  their smoothie let the beet drop is fantastic  healthy and deliciousfinally got to try the infamous prep  pastry went in with mixed feelings thinking it was all hype no show but damn was i wrong ordered the steak and eggs sand which and an order of biscuits and gravy 5 stars for my sandwich it was simply amazing the tri tip was flavorful but what really stole the show was the cheddar jalapeo focaccia the sand which alone is what will bring me back to try the rest of the menu the biscuits where delicious and the gravy was good   only thing that i wasnt impressed by was the danish i ordered the berries and cream cheese danish and it seemed very plain and didnt stand out what so ever there was another danish that had a cream cheese and goat cheese mix in it so i will try that next time in hopes to redeem the pastry end of this establishmenti went to sabor del caribe and had a totally awesome lunch today i got the pork chunks and beans and rice and salad and 2 beef empanadas i am never disappointed when i go the food is alway super top notch you will also not find empanadas nowhere this fabulous for i have tried they are alway loaded full of filling and the dip that comes with each one is the total bomb i get the fried chicken as well and it is to die for my lunch was under 1000 today and i have enough for dinner tonight if you have never been here then you do not know what you are missing and should get in you car and drive there hectors food has all the spice a great latin caribbean restaurant should have and you expect and he is a top notch chef like chef hector his food truck is always spotless inside and out and he and his wife could not be any nicer to all of their customers chef hector i enjoy your food and i enjoy your hospitality thanks so much for the great food and keep up the great work  people go see sabor del caribe you dont know what you are missingthey accommodated our large party really well great drink menu and we shared a bunch of appetizers and entrees  all tasted amazing only downside is the parkingif the lot is crowded there arent a lot of other optionswhats to say about ted drewes its delicious i like the cindermint concrete and the johnny rabbit concrete on friday  night i had the johnny rabbit cherries and chocolate chips yum i took my grandmother and she had the terramizzou she was thrilled and hadnt been there in years go there its deliciousi never realized how absurdly overpriced the mccormicks spices are at acme until i started shopping here  this place has an asininely complete collection of spices and spice blends that are fresh flavorful and very cheap  the staff is knowledgeable and helpful but i have gotten caught up in ridiculous conversations with the yenta that owns the joint  one revolved around genetic variation in human populations and involved a staff worker insisting that i had african blood in me  please dont buy overpriced spices at the grocery store anymore  buy herethe best coffee in town makes it hard to go back to sb ever again im a frappe fan but also love the hots and have never been disappointed by the quality they even know what we like and will have my husbands ready before he reaches the windowunbelievable freshness flavor variety of textures in their bahn mi they are so ridiculously good that we always order extra for the next day and they taste just as good then the pho is super good but traditional so be prepared for surprise meats i think it would be hard to find anything on their menu that is not exceptional very very favorite bahn mi placewhat a cute quaint place  the service was fantastic and the coffee was fantastic  i went with an iced coffee that tasted very nice and wasnt bitter at all  will definitely be back for moredefinitely very pricey for your regular shopping so i prefer to just get specialty items and of course food they make and serve for lunch i also love the fact that they have someone stationed in the wine area  i was there yesterday and got great guidance and ended up buying a great bottle of wine that was very well received by the person i was gifting it to while i was there i picked up some made on the spot sushi  rainbow roll  yum im definitely a fanthird window brewing company wow really tasty beers they got 6 beers on tab and all of the beers i try was tasty and flavorful with a kick i like all 6 beers that they have and the service was really nice cool chill vibe they also have food and a nice patio check them out third window brewing good beers and chill spot yelp on yelpersi really like the atmosphere at livery its very cool and rustic but a little modern industrial too an awesome place to go and sit at the bar and have some drinks the food is really good too ive had the stuffed piquillo pepper and really liked it my husband got the canelones and really liked those too we will be coming back to try morewow best cheesesteak in chesco and probably beyond  ive been living in wc for over a year now and havent had one place as a goto for cheesesteaks  went to westtown meat market the other day based on some yelp reviews and was blown away by the cheesesteaks   the quality and taste of the meat was top notch and it was on a great fresh roll    this is our goto cheesesteak place for the foreseeable future  my favorite in the philly area still remains steves prince of steaks but now theres some competitioncheerful people who know their stuff work here  the place itself is bright and roomie  the array of breads and pastries gives one pause  and while i was enjoying my coffee and chocolate croissant they took an order for a flourless chocolate cake which was to have a layer of raspberry and the top was to be decorated for a birthday  i was drooling  the calm with which they work shows in the taste and look of every item they are closed monday but be sure to double check as you would not want to be disappointedas good as it gets for a food truck food court chinese which im sure you know exactly what i mean by that is one of those lunches i just shamelessly crave i have to say this beats all cheap chinese in center city flavor wise not to mention its actually cheaper then all other options for food court chinese shrimp and broccoli egg roll lo mein and a soda all for 6 im in once a week lines are usually long but they move relatively fast so dont be deterred they have a spicy option you can add if youre into that huge portions and super friendly enjoy frugal friendsi couldnt be happier with this place the food and the service were both so wonderful i had never had a sushi burrito before and was a bit skeptical but it was perfect for me our server kory was the sweetest our table had sushi burritos crab rangoons and my husband got pho which he also had never had before we were all very happy with the people who worked there and the food they had this original spicy sauce that was delicious it had such great flavor it wasnt just hot next time i go i will definitely try some boba tea ive been wanting to try it but havent yet i think this would be the perfect place to try it looking forward to going back here again soonwe wanted asian duck and were in the area so we stopped in wow the reviews from my fellow yelpers were spot on the duck was amazing we also had the pork and chicken both amazing as well the steamed shrimp dumplings were very tasty and for me the general tso chicken took the cake i have never tasted a general tso similar this one is full of flavor the initial taste is a bit sweet with a little tang the after taste is smooth and spicy perfect dish we did not try anything from the bakery but it all looked good we will be back very soonbest tacos in indy the dinein atmosphere is little odd but the food speaks for itself so goodthis place is my favorite thing about coming to tucson it is so awesome the wait for a table is long but that is because everyone wants it and no one wants to leaveomg some of the best gelato known to mankind while i was preggers i would make my husband drive across town to get this for me when my cravings were out of control i would even sometimes drive my own bigbellyed self there and not even be embarrassed that knew all the flavors by name and taste if you have not been it is worth a visit absolutely to die forso i meant to just go in and get a croissant or danish here since ive been looking for a decent one here in reno but managed to get distracted and buy a bunch of other things to try instead because all their options looked delicious   i ended up with a poppy seed pastry a baguette and coconut cake all were pretty amazing the coconut cake was light and not overly sweet and i 100 will need to go back to satisfy my sweet toothfantastic pizzathe pie is especially good  the house salad dressing is extraordinary friendly owner and attentive staff  highly recommendedsanta barbara shellfish company wow great seafood very fresh and tasty try the uni with scallops wow the uni was really fresh still alive and moving on top of the fresh scallops wow some thing u must try it was so good that i end up getting 2 uni the grill lobsters wow fresh from the water then grilled some tasty stuff very very tasty the steamers clams wow also really fresh and tasty plus they got a good selection of craft beers check them out santa barbara shell fish company good eats yelp on yelperslove this place great food fast people working here do a great job the burrito is so big and tasty you can barely finish it but i dida diverse selection of great wines beautiful scenery live music and surprisingly tasty brick oven pizza whats not to love   seriously this place seemed like one surprise after another i enjoyed their barbera and cabernet sauvignon while my lady liked the white merlot and spuma rossa best even the spanakopita was way better than it had any right to be if theres a nicer winery in this area i havent tried it yet put this one on your must try listive ate at this fazolis a few time now and the food and service has been good  the food has always been hot and i really like their ultimate spaghetti and baked spaghetti  the restaurant is usually clean but some tables are left dirty too long  on some of the trips they didnt bring out fresh bread sticks but i had enough with my meal  it takes about 1015 minutes to get meal but it is pasta not a deep fried chicken strip so im not sure why people on this forum are complaining about the wait timethis is my go to spot for a great sandwich everything i have tried thus far has been amazeballs and even though its always super busy i seem to get in and out fairly quicklywhat a wonderful and unique experience this was an excellent excursion wonderful food great service the dessert barbakery is worth the trip by itself wide menu variety so there are many choices for everyone for the kids hot dogs etc this place specializes in greek food and there are many choices for the greek food afficuinado to the novice it was excellent this is a cant talk will call or text later miss spot if you are near tarpon springs do not miss the

this combo before  the gravy was spectacular but lets not forget the biscuitincredibly soft on the inside with a perfectly crips outside  grandma never made them so good  the monkeys shared the french

amazing thick slices fresh whipped cream and strawberriesthey were wonderful  the kids devoured them good thing i got my taste as soon as they came to the table  i had the el jefe wrap  reminded me of the chorizo burritos i make at home but they also had beans and avocadoit was the deluxe version of mine  fabulous  after chatting about how to perfect ice cream with the owner i got a scoop of coffee ice cream that had just come out of the maker  it was sooo creamy  seriously he could teach an amazing how to make ice cream class  we will be back soon  quick note be sure to tell your server how much you want to tip if paying by credit card before shehe runs your card  if you dont youll have to give cash or have your card rerun to give a tip  oh and rumor has it that they are working on getting a liquor licensetripped over this place while wandering around the garden district the maple sriracha donut rocked my world and i ended up sharing it with three complete strangers while waiting for the bus needless to say we are all bonded for lifemasssimo is a genius so glad hes back best italian food i ever in such a unique intimate and friendly environmentthe girls working today

that provide excellent service and products  thanks again for the excellent servicegreat donuts great atmosphere  very good service  the variety is fun and everchanging  never made it for the sliders or brew but maybe next time  they do a really nice job of utilizing social media tooi am a bobo addict and i love coming here for a drink the food is yummy too and the environment is super cool  not to mention all the servers are really friendly and prices affordable whats not to love great spot for a burger and fries with a full ice cream stand for dessert fantastic local spot in downtown saint louislast monday i jogged up the stairs out of the 19th and market green line station and was basically punched in the face by the amazing smells coming from this food truck more than a block away id eaten at the falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose i knew what i was going to be chowing down on that day  the food at this truck is amazing while the meal varies quite a bit from day today there are a few things you can generally count on a portion of delicious hummus some really good falafel a pita or roll a generous helping of some of the best grilled marinated chicken that ive ever tasted and two other items one of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce which is always good the other is often a sauce or fruit item   recently the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line different soups every day and a bottle of perrier with the meal he does not list a price but generally charges 10 which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day   its also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated he is a real character and likes to go on and on about how high quality his food is how difficult it is to get quality ingredients etc he wants to know if you like quality food and if you are willing to pay for quality quality quality quality quality at first i found this a little offputting but now i find it an endearing feature of the experience he clearly cares a lot about what he does and as long as you dont take the conversation too seriously itll be fine    my one major caveat for this place is do not try to eat here if you are very particular about your food he gives you what he gives you and isnt going to be making anything specific to your tastes its also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be  usually its relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot i wouldnt count on being able to get a description before getting served so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting i also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies   that said if you can get past this you are in for a really flavorful meal at a good valueour 6 year old wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday party he picked out the triple chocolate usually im overwhelmed by the richness and density of chocolate cake this cake was ahmazing perfectly moist balanced sweetness and light icing all our guests and most importantly the birthday boy loved it i cant wait to trying more of their cakesalways a great time coming here some of the cheapest soft serve in tampa but they also have a variety of other options too such as sundaes which my dad loves   i always get the vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate and it never fails ive been coming here for years with friends and family and i have so many good memories here which always makes it a pleasure to come back   the service is super fast and it was really packed tonight so props to them for getting our orders out fast and correctlythis place is amazing  coming from california ive been in a number of juice bars and this one is definitely up there with the best great for a healthy fresh squeezed vegetable or fruit juice they also have acai bowls and a bunch of vegan stuff check em outajs how do i love thee fabulous everything great fresh fish in the middle of tucson  and i live in coastal maine part of the year amazing meats as well their fresh food and salad section is awesome im a cook cook but their curried chicken salad is probably better than mine they also have a fabulous variety of hot foods ready to go as well as sushi fantastic fresh produce and bakeryprovisions has quickly become a local gem and a place i turn to when i need top quality ingredients high end salts the best vanillas chocolates and a whole bunch of great local flours plus ones that would appeal to the gluten free crowd highlight the kind of stuff you can expect to find here cookbooks and some kitchenware can also be found here high end stuff at a surprisingly notsohigh end pricewe had wings and pizza from here and we thought it was some of the best around i would recommend this place to anybody that wants good food we called ahead and it was ready for us when we got there and the service was friendly we will go back againi absolutely love this restaurant  having been to many indian restaurants in new england this was definetly a cut above  doing the tourist thing at valley forge and philadelphia we came upon this restaurant by chance  our entrees were great and the indian bread sampler was delicious  we had enough left over for breakfast the next morning and had leftover bread for lunch that day  we were so impressed we made a special trip back out to king of prussia to eat again that night  the owner of the restaurant was extremely nice and took a genuine interest in his customersmy wife and i toured with wine edventures today and we cant say enough good things about our experience  our tour guide shawn picked us up exactly when he said he would  he was extremely informative throughout the tour telling us about local area history and showing us from grapevine to bottle exactly how wine is made  we stopped at four local vineyards and did thorough tastings at each  we enjoyed many of the offerings and even purchased a few bottles to bring home with us  shawn was also extremely patienthe never rushed us at any of our tour stops and really gave us the chance to try different wines and enjoy the beautiful santa ynez weather    final note on excellent customer service  shawn realized that we had left one of the wine bottles we purchased in the rear storage of his van and called me on my cell phone to make arrangements for delivery so that i returned home with every item i had purchased on the tour  many thanks shawn  if you have any interest in learning more about wine in general or the 110 vineyards in the santa ynez valley then call wine edventures immediately  this is money well spentgreat gyro and pork souvlaki the gyro was stuffed full of very tender meat had the saganaki to start which had a nice texture and mild flavor wed have all of these again   our server was attentive and very friendly add in the free parking and thus place is a home runmy husband and i stayed at hotel mazarin on our honeymoon  we really found it to be a wonderful place my husband is a paraplegic and is in a manual wheelchair the staff and facilities were sufficiently accommodating to those needs as well as our generlw needs such as directions restaurant suggestions etc  the daily free breakfast is better than most everything from fruit to grits and the coffee is actually good  the location is great for wandering anywhere in the french quarter as there is little that is even a full mile away streetcars and bus tours are easily accessible from here as well even with being centrally located its very quiet highly recommendlove this place  their green passion smoothies are like drinking an orgasm if orgasms tasted delicious  like orgasms theyre great for you tooi eat here multiple times a week pork tacos shrimp vermicelli pho literally everything is amazing one of the best restaurants in new orleansthis was my first experience not only being in a martini bar but also a first martini i was surprised at how many different ones there were to choose from  i was always under the impression that martinis were bland social sipping drinks boy was i proved wrong with this excursion  my choice of a martini yes i only had one was called caramel apple it had vodka and apple sour schnapps and a caramel rim on the glass omg was it delicious  i sampled tastes of friends choices  there was a mango strawberry one one called  a sassy apple a bb in drag bugs bunny bitch  mona and one really delicious one called stacys tea which i believe i will be having one of those the next time i return to this fin establishment  the bar has been around for quite a while however the previous owners earned it a bad reputation for a short while before it was closed and reopened since then all i have heard about it rave reviews and after spending a couple of hours there i am now convinced i too am a fan  the bartenders were super nice and the wait times on the drinks was minimal even considering the large crowd that was in attendance dont worry if your not a martini fan there are other delicious concoctions available and they also have a full regular bar with soda beer and liquor but really why would you have an ordinary drink when you can have something fantastic do yourself a favor and check out absolutli goosed you will be so glad you didbest burger ive had in forever and easily the best chili fries ever i had the pbj burger did not disappointi totally love the steak  eggs with the breakfast potatoes and melon mule the service was great and atmosphere was cozythe food here is pretty damn awesome and i really like the aesthetics and ambience and overall casual but not slow or sleepy feel i got the pk burger with cheese and bacon and they added fried egg which is basically greatest meal ever its pictured it tasted so awesome   the waitstaff is also really nice but our particular waiter while he meant well he didnt seem too knowledgeable about the food but no big deal some people dont give an fbeing highly recommended by friends we decided to pick up a small bundt cake for our daughters birthday  we picked it up a couple of days before the party and i was a bit nervous that it wouldnt taste fresh it was wrapped up in cellophane plastic and in a box i think this helped the freshness  it was really good and still very fresh the cake was very cute and a big hit the frosting wasnt too sweet and the cake was perfect we got the chocolate with chocolate chips it wasnt too rich and very moist the princess decoration was perfectthis is an amazing place i had beauty and the beast and it was fantastic the was barely a line which made it even better i will difiniity be going backfresh creamy homemade ice cream in lots of fun flavors  i had a scoop of ginger w bits of candied ginger  a scoop of blueberry w real blueberry bits and both were delicious prices are reasonable for the size and qualitygreat gyros and burgers probably the best gyro i have ever had in the metro east area food is prepared fresh and fastthis is the best concrete joint in the world nay universe from standard concrete flavors chocolate chip strawberry chocolate vanilla etc to the christy a giant brownie sundae you really cant go wrong with anything you order my personal favorite is ordering a vanilla concrete in a cardinals cap with reeses peanut butter cups on top but the toppings list is endless so dont feel pressured to copy my order in the summer the lines will be around the block but thats part of the experience so bring your dogs your kids your friends and make an experience out of it during the christmas season they sell christmas trees and concretes but will close shortly after until about april an absolute mustdo in saint louis so dont miss outi love this little corner shop that puts out some of the best authentic mexican food you will ever eat in tampa the owners take a lot of pride in their service and menu and all is made fresh to orderi saw this place advertised on show me st louis and just had to check it out  the fountain is better than advertised  the walls  hand painted by the owner  are spectacular and will keep your eyes entertained throughout your visit  ok i did iti tried the pickle soupand i loved it  of course i had the nickname of pickles as a child due to my love of dill  so there you go  others might not love it so much i just dont know  getting a sandwich was hard as half of the selections were wiped out to me due to food allergies  i settled on a peanut butter and banana with honey as i have never tried it before  it was glorious  everyone if you value my reviews at all then do please check this place outnice strong coffee they offer dairy alternatives the coffee shop on kennedy is bigger than the one in hyde park and they have food items their avocado egg toast is absolutely deliciouskanella is like an orgasm for my taste buds and a rejuvenation of my soul i have been here twice once for dinner and for brunch and both times i left feeling like i found another wonder of the worldthe food service and atmosphere make this place well worth every penny you will spend  went today with my gf for brunch  we started with a large french press of coffee that netted us each 3 cups and an order of the houmous and pita and one of the falafel  we could have ended the meal there and been perfectly satisfied  the experience only got better however as i ordered the english breakfast which includes 2 eggs perfectly fried in olive oil a sausage link piece of slab bacon that still has me drooling baked white beans in a light tomato sauce half a grilled tomato and toast  i added a side of halloumi which isnt on the menu as a side but our waiter was more than happy to accommodate me my gf ordered the cyprus breakfast which was made famous by the best thing i ever ate and added a side of greek fried potatoes    as we ate we could only look at each other and smile because our mouthes were too full and too happy to make coherent words come out of honestly if this was my last meal on earth i would die a happy manthis place is super cool totally relaxed atmosphere delicious maryland style crab balls very pleasant owner definitely recommendedhot bhakti inspired vinyasawith mekala was by far the best yoga class i have ever been to the room temperature was just the right temperature to make you sweat but so you can still breath her routine calenged me in all the right ways  i left feeling so recharged im definitely  hooked see you all again soonmy favourite byob has now also turned into my favourite place to lunch at   i finally made it down to kanella in the daytime thought the cozy dimly lit taverna style restaurant with albeit consistently mouthwateringly delicious food would loose some of its flare in the am but oh how i was wrong   i admit i was more than a little suprised when i read esquires choice of best breakfast does kanella even do breakfast but when i arrived at kanella around noon sunlight was streaming through the giant windows highlighting the lovely bouquets of flowers and potted plants and upon glancing over the breakfastbrunchor lunch menu i saw the same simple sophiscation and understood why kanella had got the vote  my party of three ate family style sharing the kanella platter fantastic and i mean the best stuffed grape leaves i have ever tried light and fluffy zuccini fritters a nicely dressed salad and more accompanied by the yemen pastry fried yes but utterly light crisp and savoury with spicy tomato salad and last but not least the cypriote breakfast complete with grilled haloumi perfectly fried eggs and lounza a salty hamwow was it all soooo very good   to top it off i indulged in my second cup of the day and was amazed to find a restaurant that offers a strong cup of coffee   moreover i finally met the other owner and chefs other half his very lovely wife who helped serve us and was just as welcoming and warm as her husband  as always i left kanella completely satiated and already pondering my next returngreat classic bbq joint they have all the good stuff you can think of their smoked wings are huge and delicious the smoke in them is amazing and bbq sauce in them is perfect great place for lunch and dinner to go or dine ini dont know why this place has 25 stars so far it was really really good we got some sort of shrimp pasta with cream sauce and it was out of this world  the waiter made me a drink that wasnt on the menu caesar salad was amazing bread yum  who could complain nice decor never been to one beforethis place hands down is the best pizza in tucson and far beyond i have to eat gluten free and they make the best pizza around for the gluten free community the owners are the nicest and kindest people ever they are local owned and operated so if you want amazing pizza and even amazing gluten free pizza while supporting your community head to frescos you will not be disappointedoutstanding deli the sandwiches we had were all great but the secret might be in the extras that they serve macaroni bites homemade chocolate ice cream and homemade brownies were all killer  goofy and fun stuff made it a great place to go nice playroom for the kids as well give it a trycoffee and tea done properly first time here and i was not disapointed will be going backthis just happened to be the closest liquor store i found on maps when i just moved and its the only one ive gone to since the people are extremely nice and helpful  which is great because they have the largest selection ive seen in a while its easy to chose what hard liquor i want no problem but i often switch what type of wine i want and they gave me three subsections and the two i chose were so good  super clean well stocked and great staff  oh and if you need accessories just walk next doorthe food is great and the awesome owner who just makes you feel so welcome really ties in the whole experience i went there for a quick lunch and just had and great time i stayed for an hour talking to the guy and the free cuban coffee is and neat plusgreat indian spot where iirc one had been formerly but closed we dinedin on a quiet summer saturday and found the service extremely hospitable and attentive each dish was satisfying with emphasis on quality and attention to detail im extremely happy to have such a good indian option available again here in south phillybeautiful trendy coffee bar that make you feel like you are in san francisco they have many delicious and unique lattes like the orange blossom or the lavender latte the batista was kind and welcoming music is a bit on the louder side by volume but it is not obtrusive at all i would consider this a great place to studyi love it sweet and bakery pasta all the italian food dishes i love even a coffee section bar a bit of waiting cooking the burger compared to other dishes  but so worth the taste when bring my guests herethis kroger has been hanging on by a thread for the last twenty years or more the head office is always trying to kill it from inside but it survives like they say it is what it is dont expect everything to be stocked in this small store they have most things one needs or wants i like it because it is just a short walk for me the produce is fresh so is the dairy and hey they fixed the doors and put the in on the right nowone of our absolute favorite breakfast places  evah located in a strip mall its look can be deceiving but make no mistake ghinis is the real deal we have been here for breakfast and lunch several times a month we have yet to try their fri dinner but that is on our bucket list   there can be a bit of a wait on the weekends for breakfast but they have a nice set up of water etc while you wait the servers are attentive to getting your name on the list promptly the food is well worth the wait  it is always fresh and cooked to order we have never been disappointed i love the florentine omelet and my husband loves the eggs provenale we also enjoy the croque monsieur i find most of ghinis fare to be light fresh and healthy which is what we prefer over heavy carb laden monstrosities  but that is just us my son loves the french toast and heavier omelets   they are a pet friendly place allowing dogs on the patio leashed which we find endearing there is also a bakery right next door  not sure if they are affiliatedpartners  or separate  but we enjoy eating our breakfast and then grabbing some baked goods to take home   its a nice laid back way to spend a weekend morning with a great cup of coffee and good fresh tasty food there is a reason she has been in business 20 yearsthey make the best flat whites not to mention their beans are expertly roasted the roaster knows about his coffees and ensures that the beans are sourced from respectable farmsthe filipiniana philippine caf just had their soft opening yesterday and i couldnt have been more excited its great to see filipino businesses opening around town like the pao truck it makes the wait for philfest easier to bare and its fun having new exotic things to try   the cafe sells bubble tea boba halohalo filipino shaved ice drinks filipino coffee filipino baked goods smoothies and more things on the menu are fairly prices and the cafe itself has a modern feel to it   i enjoyed a halohalo supreme yesterday 5 and it was excellent all the ingredients tasted fresh and my filipino friends were definitely enjoying it as well and coaching me on tips for mixing everything together for the best flavor the halohalo has flan in it which is awesome and shows the roots of filipino cuisine in spain   we also tried the ensaymada ube bread 3 which was excellent it is a baked dessert that is stuffed with ube purple yam which is perfectly sweetened the bread itself was soft and enjoyable and could also pair well with some coffee   the location is next to the original saigon deli on waters and dale mabry behind the la quinta hotel its hidden from the road so you should look for the saigon deli sign   im excited for all these new businesses in tampa and look forward to spending lots of time hanging out and enjoy filipino sweets at the filipiniana philippine cafim blown away by how delicious my burger was best burger ive ever had and im 55 years old kudos to the chef this place was recommended by someone on my friends flight from houston into st louis we are here for the joyce meyer conferencethis is quite possibly the best grocery store in tucson i mainly just come here for lunch though really they have basically like 3 or 4 little restaurants inside the place where you can get anything from pizza to sushi from their sushi bar and oh they probably have the best salad bar in tucson this is an excellent place for lunch or if you are looking for the best quality steaks or rare imported beer or wine in townive been to baileys range three times and each time i leave happy and fully satisfied the food is amazing and the drinks are different and delicious  the food the burgers are constantly changing but they always offer something that youll like i always go for anything with guacamole and cheese  oh and the fries oh wow so good they have several different dipping sauces which is really nice  the drinks they have awesome pitchers for a great deal of their lemonades boozy lemonade who doesnt want booze in their lemonade the ambiance the layout is super fun with upstairs and downstairs seating   definitely check them out for your burger and fry fix great friendly staff store was clean flavors were filled and diverse toppings were filled and clean prices are reasonable floors are clean they offer some nice deals and have coupons there are 8 flavors and 26 dry toppings along with 21 wet or fresh toppings just to be clear they do not charge by weight its a flat rate per cup size i posted a picture of the sizes and pricesice cream here is excellent made fresh and you can tell the flavors shine through and taste it their sauces are also homemade and were greatthe food is so good and big variety of meals prices are the best part my recommendations are the popcorn chicken and the crispy calamari so good so home made  definitely coming back and more oftenthis place was fantastic the pizza rolls are not similar in shape to those frozen things theyre actually made like cinnamon rolls with pizza dough instead of pastry and saucefillings instead of cinnamon sugar theyre amazing  i got one of the daily specials which was puppy drum fish with a side of pasta i wasnt a huge fan of the fish but i think i just dont like puppy drum as much as i expected to it was prepared fine though the pasta is obviously homemade and the marinara is delicious  my boyfriend got a dish that i cant remember the name of but it was basically pasta shrimp and mushrooms in a rich butter sauce shrimp diane maybe it was very good i actually ended up eating his leftovers and i might get that next time   the bread is good though very full of sesame seeds so beware if thats not your thing we finished with the tiramisu the flavor was great but the texture was too wet for my taste again its more a matter of taste than anything they did wrong well definitely try the cherrymisu next time which is tiramisu but with cherry juice in place of coffee   the service was fantastic the place was clean it was easy to park   however my absolute favorite thing was hearing one of the cooks tell another ill be back im going to go peel some shrimp i love a place that uses fresh seafood and does things without cutting corners   i will 100 be returning and im already thinking about what im going to ordermy my my i am surprised by all the reviews that were under three stars because this restaurant was a definite hit for me when i used to work at boeing as a contractor  i came into this restaurant at least once a week their gyros are huge chocked full of the gyro meat and their fries are always hot and fresh if you are a christian they always have free bibles they give away in addition to different pro christian charities if you are you not part of the christian persuasion this is easy to ignore simply because of the good food  i am so upset that i dont live close to this establishment though would love to come in the futurecome hungry leave feeling like a true merican glutton mmmmerca again be sure to pass on a few of the earlier items as the gauchos bring out the better cuts later i have nothing bad to say about my time here i am still fulli met up with a group of co workers for a couple of beers and ended up finding a gem of a place amazing beer selection and the food menu looked delicious ill be back for food next time the staff was extremely friendly and attentive i thought that being in seminole heights parking wouldve been an issue but theres a huge lot across the street designated for parking for their place i only wish i lived closer or maybe they can open another location closer to sarasota wishful thinkinghandsdown the best coffee in new orleans both the espresso drinks and the pour over here is firstrate friendly staff reliable wifias a child fridays were my favorite day of the week  why  the end of then work week my mother would stop at the then named swiss pastry shop and pickup delectable treats for the whole family   this ritual greatly contributed to a happy childhood  i have loved the hazelnut sacher cake for too many years to count and am so happy that it taste just as good to me now as it did then  i have introduced many people to the now swiss haus with nary a one ever being disappointed  i recently had one of their gluten free almond joy tarts and it was delicious  i so look forward to summer when they make key lime tartswonderful  thank you to the owners and bakers who through this shops transitions have kept faith with old world recipes and traditionsthis is the best hot sausage place hands downgooooo goooo now ask for the relish really pepper hash makes it magically delishim having wife delivery me a hot sausage as im writing thiscant waitwe have visited here several timesthe froyo is tasty and very low calorie  the decor is very cute very welcoming for adults and kiddos  we like getting our froyo and playing checkers at one of the tables sitting in the big rocking chairs  the prices are very reasonable  this has definitely become our goto local place when were craving dessertthis restaurant surely deserves five stars between the excellent service phenomenal drinksone of the best old fashions in the cityand perfect atmospherei got the boulder shake chocolate porter it was great this place had a really nice vibe super relaxing and laid back a great place to go to with my girlfriends i wish i had tried the food at the cafe though it looked and smelled amazingthe only thing wrong with flap jacks are their hours im a gal that loves breakfast for dinner on occasion  they have quick service and quick meals served hot and fresh and taste like home made as if your momma and grandma are working in the kitchen  the portion size fills you for at least two mealssuch a delight definitely a regular at this indianapolis location and their brownsburg locationi love banh mi and i will go out of my way to get a good banh mi much to my surprise i discovered a new spot in north wilmington   for me the banh mi thit nguoi is the litmus test for whether i would be a returning customer if youre a banh mi place and you cant get banh mi thit nguoi right then i have a hard time justifying coming back to your establishment   luckily the banh mi i had today was very good the bread wasnt too doughy the pate and cold cuts were quality the veggies were pickled right and the fresh veggies were well fresh like they should be they didnt skimp on the meat either which is always a big turn off   im so glad this new place opened and is not too far from where i live i dont have to trek all the way to philly to get my fix if youre looking for an authentic viet treat this is iti ordered carryout i ordered the cubano sandwich which had pulled pork on it and ham it was very good for the price point weirdly enough my favorite thing i had was their collard greens which were very good as well all in all definitely worth the money and i imagine everything on their menu is good very good food it really is worthy of five starsgot the babaganoush and baguette delicious service was good it gets busy but not too crowdedthis place has the best chinese food that i have had  strongly recommend wonton in chili oil 3 cup chicken and beef with scallion  always order off the authentic menuafter leaving another bakery close by with a famous name empty handed and unimpressed  we used google maps to find this gem  the customer service was amazing super helpful and friendly the selection was good everything looked fresh and delicious too delicious i bought way more than i needed everything tasted delightful the cupcakes were beautiful and if you like cookie dough you cant go wrong with the chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake  i loved the lemon bar and chocolate cheesecake cake i highly recommend this adorable bakeryi wish they sucked at something so i didnt feel so bad about myselfthis place is two great breweries in one outliers and brugges brasserie i love the traditional brewery atmosphere just grab a pint on benches near the brewing floor  they serve pints and fill growlers but will let you taste anything before deciding what to get i tend to get their whitcomb rye or brugges pooka but they have some great barrel aged projects in the works outliers is one of the best new breweries in the city and im excited to have another hang out on the east side of downtownwowza  we had the best of the best experience today we have been here several times and the serve was so so however this time the service was outstanding timely and tastyi thought this burger joint was phenomenal i ordered a chicken burger with pepper jack bacon guacamole pico and ranch and the flavors were excellent the chicken was amazing i also thought our waiter was very attentive and helped with recommendations as well this is a very cute hip place that seemed filled with the typical gluten free hipster but i really enjoyed iti will start on monday ya right way to good a definite try its just good for the soulhappened upon this little shop en route to another destination   because fishmongers are hard to come by in bucks county i felt obliged to stop and check it out   the first thing you notice is the utter absence of a fishy aroma   exactly the way it should be   the counter help was very helpful   i was looking for stone crab claws and the counter help suggested jonah crab claws instead because they were available and less expensive  the jonah claws were terrific firm fleshed claws very similar in texture to stone crab claws  also picked up a pint of their homemade oyster stew which compares favorably to that of sansom street oyster house   my only quibble is that it needed a few more oystersthe portion for large was really enormous love that i can mix and match and eat more than 10 different ingredients in a settingholy toledo  get in here the traditional lao food is darn tasty everything is made to order and super fresh the owner is awesome and will make suggestions if you need themvery unique and delicious food service has been consistently good wide

impressive selection to choose from next time im going to try a jelly donutthese are the very best pancakes ive ever had my wife too and our 3 year old son too we got there very early and it was still

on our list of must go places whenever we are in nashvillei came here this afternoon for a monthly business networking event called brewing up business great spot to enjoy one of their homemade microbrews if you like what you taste they also sell prowlers quart sealed cans filled from the tappers the tractor chairs are very unique and very comfortable i guess they have to be if tractor

the food is always good tried it one of the first days they were open and now i am addicted a must trycame home from a trip overseas and girlfriend announces she found a banh mi shop in wilmington skeptical at first i agreed to check it out i was quite surprised by their menu being written in vietnamese which gives me an authentic vibe i glanced at the staff and asked them something in vietnamese and she replied which was rather assuring ive had past experiences where you enter an establishment which claims they are vietnamese and turned out to be chinese and thats another story   onto the food we ordered an original and a grill chicken banh mi very authentic and large in size which made it a very good deal very tasty and stuffed with meats and veggies overall it is my new place for banh mi and saves me the trip up to washington ave in philadelphia for genuine vietnamese banh mimy favorite place to get shellfish besides fresh off the pier on saturday mornings it is not just a tourist trap even though you can find it at the end of the sb pier past all the other tourists traps love to get the rock crab deal 25 for a 23lb rock crab with onion rings   my favorite moment  i will never forget the day we tried their california king crab for the first time it was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking sup with paddle sports from the harbor area and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co while on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier after our hour on the ocean we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular luckily since it was early before 5pm dinner rush we were seated quickly the server recommended the cali kings said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh we looked over and there they were being dumped into the tanks they were kicking and trying to climb out   priced at 1795 per lb they came anywhere between 15 to 3 lbs i went for a 2pounder that first succulent bite was heaven and i mean damn that is one buttery heaven each morsel was so large so sweetall of my girls and i were silent with glistening eyeballs staring at each other   after that day i couldnt get that crab out of my mind any chance i could i wanted to go back before the season was over  but be careful a 3 pounder means youre eating a 75 crab only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad for that pricei shouldve gotten both its okay just add a 1 and you can both i guess   besides the crab the oysters are always good and i highly recommend the uni appetizer   okay i really recommend the uni appetizer i usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu its so fresh and clean that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wigglingi love this place my husband and i usually have a few beers and a meal once a month since they opened the quality is great and the restaurant is comfortable my husband usually orders the reef donkey and i usually order off of the visiting taps just to see what kind of beers are being made in our area in terms of food i love the hummus the hot pretzel the greek salad the burgers ive tried nearly all of them and theyre great and the pizza i wanted to like the fish n chips but the fish is just bland as heck chefs please add salt to your batter and marinate in buttermilkamazing bakery as you walk in you get a draft of fresh baked bread one of the best guatemalan bakeries within california and nevada i recommend you also try the tamalesi finally got a chance to try danny boy  i had a flight of several beers that were all delicious  i also had a 12 pound of bacon and chicken nachos  the bacon was delicious and can easily be shared with several peoplenowadays we have so many places we can go into to pass time or to have a meeting with a long lost friend or business meeting from my last experiment at this location i was impressed with seeing a gentleman a part of the staff with a long beard and the amount of multi tasking he helped me with a question and recommendations i had about a drink and food choice for the experience while being able to fully continue the work he was assigned or is daily assigned thanks again big beard gentleman will get name when i am there again and to the experience and company thank you for both of your timereal great flavor options i had the toasted marshmallow and its was very good its around 3 a scoop i will be going backmy husband and i are visiting tampa from southern california to attend the buccaneers opening gamelucked up on this restaurantwe were waiting to be called for a table at brunchies and happened to walk by taces lounge we walked inside to check out the menu and liked what we saw and decided to give it a try and man were we glad my husband stated that outside of his mothers and my cooking it was the best breakfast he has ever eaten  he had the catfish and brie cheese grits with a side of sausagei loved my meal too i  had the biscuits and gravy with country fried chicken we split some fried green tomatoes which were fantastic the service was great the staff was welcoming and very friendly we had a blasthuge crawfish great price seasoned perfectly  the employees are super nice the service was quick when we get there the line was out the door we were out of there in less then 10 min ill definitely be coming backhmmmneighborhood sketchiness factor on a scale of 110 was about a 5    but the idea of being able to have a crunchy on the outside fluffy on the inside ball in my mouth made the trip well worth it  im talking about big fried falafel balls in my mouth  i was surprised to see how busy the place was and the variety on their menu  we had an order of falafelsa little on the pricey side6 for 699but i suppose they were a little bit larger than some other places that i have been to  these were pretty good  the brother had the gyros with the greek salad  the salad looked amazing big chunks of feta and stuffed grape leaf a scoop of potato salad ok this part didnt really look too greek to me but it was good sissy and law and i had the shish kabobs  large portions on the platters  rice beans and a tasty cucumbertomato salad  the flavors were spot on and we left with full tummies  will definitely return to try some of the other interesting looking things on the menu fish and wings sound quite lovelythis is appetizer heaven with great service if you are ever in old downtown clearwater makes sure you have time to eat at clear skythe cupcakes and chocolate chip cookies are excellent here they also had an insane coffee cake with chocolate icing so good prices are average 350 for a cupcake 2 per cookie   the only complaint i have is they dont offer donuts when i went and they only had 2 flavors of cookies i get that its the cake stand but in a bakery donuts and cookies are usually my gotoawesome thin crust nice spot you wont find a better pizza in philly  great food salad bar fresh fruit  gourmet slices  fantastic food and large dining area with tv  this is legit 5starfood was amazing atmosphere perfect service wonderful but the best part was the chocolate banana martinithe best donuts ever  looking forward to another trip from wildwood for their donuts  the grandchildren loved themthis review is based of the banh mi vietnamese poboy out of all the vietnamese restaurants in mid city this little convenient store does it right if you are looking for a great unaltered banh mi with the traditional ingredients and taste this is the place to be they also have boudin for a good price the dishes are also worth trying but their sandwich is a must try firsti have to start by saying that im so sad i had not heard about this place sooner  thank you to yelp and the review of the day or i might not have ever known about this place  the restaurant is really cute  lots of seating inside and they have a nice patio to sit and eat outside  now the fun part we start looking at the menu and the awesome guy behind the counter lets us know that its happy hour so everything on the menu is 50 off  what  note to self happy hour tuesday through sunday i think its through sunday 50 off from 36 on dine in only  yes please  so we decided that we wanted to try a few things  we ordered the cauliflower pizza a cheeseburger on a cauliflower bun with a side of cauliflower sticks and a kids order of the zoodle spaghetti  our total 16  i mean  so inexpensive and for all healthy food  heck yes  we grabbed a table inside we were the only patrons in there which made me a little sad because if the food is good and healthy then we want this place to last  we get the pizza first  2 small cauliflower pizzas so we each got one  omg  they were so full of flavor the cauliflower crust totally holds up it was so darn good  i couldnt get enough  then the zoodle spaghetti came out  yum  why have i never made zoodles before  they needed a little salt but thats ok they choose to not over salt or pepper their food because everyone has different tastes  i like that  then the burger came out  it was huge  there was so much meat  we cut it in half to split  now i like my burgers with ketchup or ranch some sort of sauce  there wasnt any sauce on this but man it didnt need it  there was an abundance of flavor  the cauliflower bun again held up so well and that already has a ton of flavor  then the meat was so well seasoned  there were the freshest yellow tomatoes on top  i was in heaven  the cauliflower sticks were pretty darn good i think i would have loved them even more if i had ranch to dip them in  but they were still good  we ate everything and i was so full  thats what happens when you eat healthy    so then we decided that we had to each buy a loaf of cauliflower bread  they are 12 a loaf but it comes with 12 slices  and they can last in the fridge for about 2 weeks i think this is a great deal  we also saw desserts and had to go there  i got a gluten free chocolate chip cookie i mean it had so much flavor a little salt a little sweet its huge and i ate the whole thing  we also had a chocolate muffin i believe it was gluten free vegan and paleo  it had a banana taste and was ooey gooey soft and delicious  i hope this place keeps up the good work on making such healthy food and i hope that people keep coming here  i want this place to flourish  go here get some yummy food and get healthyawesome cookie  highly recommend this place  it was the best cookie ever  its in a great location with lots of things to do aroundone day after a really long 2 hour class i was incredibly hungry i am not a big food truck eater and after walking by i decided eh why not  i figured i would order and go home i ordered the mexican chicken platter and headed to my car the aroma of the of the warm food had me wanting just a small bite i figured one small bite and go home and enjoy the rest well see sometimes things do not go according to plan i couldnt stop eating one bite just wasnt enough you see i was so incredibly hungry and this was so incredibly awesome i finished eating most of the dish and the feel good relaxed chemicals in my brain started flowingmy husband and i got noodle dishes and they were excellent fresh ingredients with a wonderful flavor a must go to if you love vietnamese foodbest brunch in town their drinks and pastries are amazing their sweet potato hash is my favorite breakfast optionwell worth the wait and weight  the banana and nutella with caramel is my favoritefinally a good latin restaurant in nelower bucks the meats are seasoned and tasty

i just dont get it why arent more people in love with your cup of goodness  i heart with all of my heart la colombe xo xo xo xo xo xo  learn more about todd the master of coffee perfection  httplacolombecomfoundersi dont know that im actually cool enough to hang out at coffeebar but i do love it in fact their lavender latte and i are besties ive never had a drink that ive simultaneously wanted to smell drink and bathe in that is also caffeinated way to go coffeebar 10 points to you  but seriously coffeebar is the bees knees i love the location the interior is funky oh tiny cups with

at longingly crepes including a nutella crepe a nutella crepe so good it makes god cry and tea plus beer plus wine  add all of this  hipsters and it equals my favorite coffee place in renoi got the lavender latte with an espresso shot and a sticky toffee pudding the menu is fairly standard with some creative flair and they have some beerwine for a chill happy hour the staff were super friendly and helpful and it is a great place to sit down at one of the tables and read or study the sticky toffee pudding when warmed up was super delicious and id totally go back for one of those any daymy experience here was all around very positive my waitress was extremely attentive and helpful from explaining many menu items individually and catering to our table as if we were the only ones there   i ordered the nachos and mexican corn as my appetizers the nachos came in huge portions and very stuffed with cheese jalapeos etc so delicious the mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy which i really appreciated  the table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal a nice touch chips couldve been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor  i ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too beany for my taste   great service and nice clean atmosphere food is terrific i would definitely recommendive only had the rare steak pho here but it was the best pho ive ever tasted  i will definitely make this my regular pho place the service was great too very fast and everyone was very friendlyincredible best cinnamon buns ive had in my entire life always fresh and still hot right out of the oven  staff are always friendly and price is reasonable  i always make sure to grab one whenever im at the mall and the frosting is to die forevery time im here  kate never disappoints  try something new  youll always walk away full and happythe days that i get to go to the falafel truck at lunch always feels so special ive never waited in line less than 45 minutes so i can only make the trip on days that i know i have plenty of free time for lunch its quite an experience and the food is amazing ill just reiterate some of what others have already said the cook is a real character so the experience can be intimidating if you dont know what to do   the truck is located on the northeast corner of 20th and market next to an empty lot youll recognize the truck because it will have a long line smoke pouring out of the top and decorations on the front of the truck including plants and garlic the truck wasnt there the first few times i tried to go so im not sure if he goes on vacation at some point also keep in mind that even if the line doesnt look that long it takes a lot of time maybe 5 minutes per person thats in front of you   while you wait in line he will offer you a cup of delicious soup that you should take and enjoy i dont know exactly what it is but it tastes like pumpkin or some other type of squash once you get to the front of the line you dont need to order you just take what he gives you and pay 10 you usually get hummus falafel chicken two side items like rice or grains or vegetables fruit a piece of bread or pita and a drink of the cooks choosing its an unbelievable amount of food for 10 and its all amazing i wish i knew what the chicken is marinated in because its truly the best chicken ive ever had the hummus is especially good too its really creamy i normally eat half of it at lunch and put the rest in the fridge and then go back to it around 4 pm because i cant resist it and youll smell like garlic for the rest of the day so its a constant reminder that delicious leftovers are waiting for you   the cook is actually friendly as long as you dont question the food hell usually make some light conversation and talk a lot about the quality of the food just listen smile and agree and youll be oki went to the screamery today with my daughter and her boyfriend and i was pleased to hear that they are looking at a second location closer to me  the service was excellent  we were immediately asked if we had ever been there and when we said no we were given the run down on how the ice cream is made and invited to try as many flavors as we wanted  the owner also had a conversation with us telling us where the grass fed milk was from and their overall story  i also found out that you can get the game day ice cream at sentential peak brewery which is closer to me as well  the ice cream was rich and decadent  i had the sweet cream honeycomb and the mudd pie  both amazing  the kind that i want to be alone with and savor every bit   dont talk to me while i eat this  mmm  and its actually good for youso ive only had delivery so i know the food has to be even better when its fresh cheese steak with provolone was awesome the steak was tenderauthentic taiwanese food amazing tastes and flavors it is totally worth to drive all the way here for a decent meal i will definitely come againso glad to have a great vietnamese place uptown the spring rolls were authentic and the peanut sauce was great i had the meatball pho and thought the broth was aromatic and very tasty furthermore they have a stocked bar and are open on sundays which as many vietnamese food lovers know is quite rare   will definitely be going back soonwow amazing service didnt know grocery stores could treat people so nice made our beach experience so much better i know most people dont care about the reviews to the grocery store they go to but i recommend you try this one out you will find what you need and be guided by the employeesive been coming here for years to pickup scripts  from their pharmacy they have a great pharmacist named faith who i have known known for years she has more knowledge  of meds than my pcp i was taking two med that could be fatal unbelievable  but its nice that faith  goes out of here way to answers  questions one of the best things about this walgreens i have also been pleased with their photo dept i had a small pic from years ago made into a bigger really good great stuff for cell phones and accessories pretty  nice pharmacy   i did lot of shopping here which i wouldnt normally do because the prices are much higher on over the counter but i am in so much shock and grief as my mother just died and i ended up spending  200 paper goods detergent supplements etc the place is clean  watch for specials they are no longer open 24 hours which i miss for grabbing  something in emergency  but they have huge selection makeup greeting cards protein  drinks  supplements freezer foods and drinks pretty mucheverything you would find in and market  and summer  apparel  large parking  lot and drive thru pharmacy dont even have to get out  overall good pharmacy i have yet to find a flavor i didnt like and i think we have tried almost all of them its a weekly visit for my family to get treats to last us through the week try it you wont regret itperfect place  i cant count how many times we have been and every time was an amazing experience  we had our engagement party here as well with about 40 guests and everyone was beyond happy with the atmosphere inn staff  food we are having dinner next week and im over excited to get backdo not sleep on the delicious everything covered oreos at southern candymakers im so upset that we ate at 4 places prior to visiting and didnt buy more crack cookies to take home currently in the car wishing i had bought more  i know everyone comes here for the pralines but thats not how i roll the candied pecans they gave us as samples were also super delicious yummozzarella has been opened for a few months now and its reputation is growing quickly by word of mouth  i can only speak for their pizza which is the best on this side of town but their menu consists of salads pasta subs calzones and so on they delivery and do carryout but they have a nice seating area if youd rather dine in free wifi and 495 lunch specials  call first to see if they still have their carryout special a large onetopping pizza for only 799 or 5 toppings for 1099im not a coffee afficianado but the coffee is good noticeably better than starbucks and the regional chain kahwa they also have good matcha as an alternative to coffee edibles are high quality but limited and i rarely partake coffee and edibles are served with good ceramicware and glassware  the room and seating are sparenothing soft and cushywhich is fine with me but might not be if youre expecting ergonomic or cushy seating it can be crowded with many 20 and 30somethings in pairs and with laptops and cellphones most people are well bahaved meaning take their cellphone calls outside but even when crowded ive always found a place  exceptional staff  attentive professional and skilledthe pizza is excellent but this harahan establishment is much more than a pizza place the food service and open hospitality are exceptional the creativity and experience of the chefs is apparent in all of the traditional italian items and the changing daily specials it is a family friendly place where all are welcome open 7 days a week with daily specials and sunday brunch itemswe travel 20 minutes from our home in east germantown to get pizza and wing dings from slices both my husband and i are not philadelphia natives and we find most philly pizza appalling but slices gets the job done they also make delicious buffalo chicken cheesesteaks yum yumi care that much for doughnuts but these are pretty amazing their bacon maple one is incredible and worth trying also their sliders are equally great ive had their cheeseburger one and chicken caesar and would get them againwe had some great concretes here this past saturday  my favorite is vanilla with reeses peanut butter cups  it makes me hungry just thinking about it   my wife likes the chocolate custard with oreos  ive honestly never had anything here that wasnt good  they have a sundae that has devils food cake custard and hot fudge  it is dynamite  im always amazed at how busy this place is even when its cold and raining  the staff does a great job of getting through the lines in a hurry  even if the line looks long theres never a long wait  i just wish it would have been nice enough for my wife and i to sit outside and eat  it was too cold so we ate it in the car  this is a st louis landmark so if youve never been its definitely worth trying  we try to come here several times a year and it makes a great spot for dessert if you eat dinner at trattoria marcellagreat beer selection great food the pizza is actually really good comfortable bar and restaurant seating indoors and out very friendly staff  location is not in westchase but convenient to westchaseschlafly is amazing period i have yet to try one of their beers i did not like black ipa kolsch amber ale oatmeal stoutall great beers it may not have been the flavor for the moment but i have yet to cringe at a soapy sample or a bitter brew speaking of samples theyre always willing to give you a few to choose the right beer for the occasion beyond beer the establishment stands strong a great variety of foods last night our table had appetizers of hummus plate and the goat cheese followed by meals of lo mein green curry bbq pulled pork and a margherita pizza it was all delicious the menu is constantly changing with the seasons in addition head out on a wednesday night and check out the local farmers market go there nowlocated in busy

it was necessary to share my love of pps food my family and i arrived pretty early around 8am on a saturday with two kids in tow there was a little bit of a line but it moved along quickly and id say the wait was about 15 minutes long to get in once we got in we were taken care of quickly by very kind servers i ordered the grill cooks medley and it was divine the potatoes were fried up nice and crisp with a little bit of soft potato layered within the crust and covered in grilled veggies and meat i ordered the meal with a side of pancakes and those were simply deliciousfluffy and sweet id

has to offer their beer is fantastic for being the largest craft brewer in town they still keep it fresh and interesting their pumpkin ale is the best ive ever had hands down the food in the

10 cars in line so i decided to go inside a continuous line of 6 to 10 people were waiting to place their orders the whole time i was there i got the big box 3 chicken strips biscuit rice and beans and cajun fries chose the bbq sauce for dipping the only thing i would say was a bit overdone was the breading on the chicken a bit too much the sauce was excellent tangy and spicy it was very good the place was clean and the crew was working like a well oiled machine very smooth the wait was not too long finally my wait is over as i was hoping for a popeyes in south county for over 25 years great coffee the really care about what they are serving they me decide what i should have and he hit the mark  ive been there twice now to have their cuban coffee  ask them to put the cane sugar in the with the ground espresso beans  i will be going there everyday during my 10 day stay in phillyi love these burgers  the fries are pretty good too  dont even get me started on the cheese steaks  try to go during daylight hours  the street is a little on the rough side  fitting more than one baby in there who needs a high chair is pretty toughi love the studio every yoga class i have taken there has been unique professional and awesome the teachers are highly trained and each so diverse in their area of expertise also the massages are some of the best ive ever had to complete the experience you can enjoy a fresh organic juice or salad and other goodies downstairs i highly recommend the studiolove this place the ice coffee is what i normally get here and it is really good what my favorite it is the delicious egg and cheese scramble on biscuit sooo good the donuts look amazing one day i will have to try onedefinitely a good go to burger place the chicken stew they currently have though omfg yumafter looking at other reviews on yelp i had to come here i also noticed seating seemed limited but we decided to go at an off hour even then it was still busy but we managed to snag a table   i will say every review that cites this place as being slow in service is spot on  it is slow i dont think the kitchen is well organized to be honest and they dont encourage take out orders which is why they are always so full   we ordered two lunch combos one with a figo pizza and a caprese salad the other with a margherita pizza and a caesar salad for the beverage we both got the unsweetened iced tea i wish they had better beverage options   the pizzas were both amazing and perfectly balanced on par with pizzeria bianco though i say pizzeria bianco is just a little better the salads were delicious but my husband was a little off put by the piece of anchovy on top on the caesar then there was this crusty bread that was complimentary with olive oil to die for   at the end of the meal we were given a tiny spoonful of the gelato i was given sweet cream my husband hazelnut we thought the gelato was delicious but quite frankly we were completely out of room i think they should lead the visit with a gelato sample or do a special with dessert or salad maybe next time   overall i would say the food was excellent service was ok but slow and the prices were reasonable they do need a larger dining room with more staff and a better layout time to expandi expected to go there try the veggie burger and leave without giving it that much thought  it turns out a place that sells a lot of beef might become the new vegan hot spot of philadelphia  they label their menu which shows they are attuned to the concerns of vegans so they meet the bare minimum good thing they surpass it  for starters get the pickles and slaw bare snack two kinds of vegan slaw the whole thing is fantastic it made the perfect sharing item for a party of three  they also have so many toppings and sides that are vegan the vegan sandwiches they offer can be modified to add these items such as chickpea onions and stout onions   my wife and i split two vegan sandwiches guadalupe burger and the mazuma tempeh sandwich both were great i especially appreciate that they make their own veggie burger no morningstar farms here  for dessert we had the vegan carrot cake the only item we ate that we didnt love i would skip it net time  seriously the meal i just had there compares very favorable to the many great allvegan restaurants in philadelphia i am very very impressedi love the concept of this restaurant its cute and quaint inside they now have two locations on central ave very convenient if youre downtown or closer to 34th street  ive gone three times and the first time i got the mini cakes in tip of the shooters of wine it was a unique concept and allows you to try just a bite of different flavors which i am a big proponent for  the second time i got the frose and the cookie crunch cheesecake let me tell you that was phenomenal i highly recommend this  ive also gotten their banana cream pie concoction and this was good as well i enjoyed it but not as much as the cheesecakegreat experience  second time at granite city brewery our server kylie was top notch  great food and drink recommendations service we had the the pulled pork waffle sandwich and pepper maple bacon flatbread worth another visit real soonif youre looking for a delicious breakfast created by people who take pride in what they serve youll like yolklore were lucky to live in the neighborhood its clean welcoming and fairly priced though theyre known for their egg dishes my personal favorite is the vegan baked oatmeal with either a side of fruit or the potatoes the oatmeal is topped with soy yogurt drizzled with a touch of honey my wife likes the birds nest we never leave without pop tarts for laterwhat can i say this place is the perfect local lowkey restaurant that provides consistently wonderful sushi why go anywhere else dinein takeout or delivery they have me as a regularwas blown away by this place not the highest rated bbq place in town but tried it after a suggestion from a local  i think i liked this place so much because the brisket rib is heavy on black pepper  i like peppery meats and jerky so this peppery crusted brisket was right up my alley  the sides were good and didnt seem like an after thought ribs were tender and fall off the bonethis place is wonderful we found it today while looking for dedicated gluten free restaurants the bakery is ran by a friendly hardworking mother whos autistic son works there as well and they only employ individuals on the spectrum  the items were all great none of the foods tasted any less as gluten free casein free desserts the cookie dough chocolate cupcake was especially good i really like that they have interesting options too like jalapeo strawberry bread and the owner said they are coming up with new ideas each week and letting people vote on them on social media  the owner went out of her way to be kind she realized that our toddler is also on the spectrum and she invited her to help water plants out front the workers were perfectly accommodating and not phased by our daughter throwing a tantrum on the floor  they definitely seem supportive of the community i saw that their artwork on the wall is only from individuals with mental disabilities they sell autism shirts there as well definitely a great place for the communityi heart claudios i have just recently been introduced to meat and cheese plates and life is now complete claudios helps me create little indulgent plates for wine and cheese dates with my girlfriends the guys behind the counter are very helpful and even more generous with samples do yourself a favor and try them out youll find yourself crawling back for a fix lol  personal faves red pepper flake soppressata parma prosciutto prima donna omg maytag bleu cheese super strong triple cream brie also ask to try the baked lemon ricotta guarantee you go home with half a pound i love love love trader joes this is my favorite grocery store of all time i wish they would build on in bloomington i only get to go there when visiting family in indy this location is great friendly staff always clean and a fun place to shop   tjs is crazy different from any other grocery store and most people dont know a few things about trader joes  1 everything with the trader joes logo is  gmo free has no artificial coloring has no artificial preservatives  2you can try anything is the store as long as it doesnt have to be heated frozen meals etc you can bring it to the sample station and they will open it for you to try im talking cheese juice fruits ice cream yogurt chips protein bars cereals candyanything  3 they are always sampling items while most stores do this for you to buy things of course they want you to buy it too trader joes actually wants you to try something you normally would never buy  they have so many unique and different foods this lets you try something you may have never even seen in the store before  4 they always have new products this is good and bad because if you are a fan of a seasonal item you have to stock up when you see it  not only do they have certain items that come out seasonally but they are always introducing new items every week  they even have a new item shelf that you can check out so you dont miss anything  again though the down side is they are a small store and if certain items dont sell great you may never see them again  5 you can return anything no questions asked  they want you to try new things and if you dont like it just bring back the receipt or an empty wrapper and they will refund you on the spot  its also good if something you buy spoils fast  6 every store has a mascot a stuffed animal the staff hides it everyday so that kids can look for it  when you find it go to the sample station for your free lolipop  its a great idea and a great way to keep kids occupied as parents shop  those are just some of the main things that set tjs apart  it is such a fun and colorful store to be in  everyone that works there is always in a good mood and there is always someone around to help youlove this place the staff is super friendly and the food is good i usually order the vegetarian caprese sandwich w asparagus and strawberries on a hot day make sure to check out their icee stand in the backjust came home from this quietly elegant hotel ideally located in the french quarter steps off of bourbon street my room was spacious and immaculate the service was great and the included breakfast buffet excellent with a constant flow of fresh food right off the courtyard was a great little wine bar patricks bar vin which i highly recommend i would definitely stay here again if i make it back to the big easyexcellent food beef pancake is a must try along with any of the bento boxes and of course no meal is complete without boba love that that they are open late until midnight on the weekendscody and paul made us feel very welcome cody insisted we sampled mostly everything before settling on a sneaky redhead i will definitely be back to stoneyhead great products on offer friendly service and very reasonable prices i was told this place has been in operation for three years long may it continue look out for the sneak attack and the 7 troughs oak attack instructions will be given at the barthese stars are mostly the owner tina who was absolutely amazing to me she was incredibly helpful and sweet and ended up talking to me for a long time about my neighborhood and gave me a detailed map to help me find my way around she has a cute little chocolate display with good chocolate and kitschy trinkets that are perfect for gifts to take back to wherever your visiting from its a great place to go because you will leave feeling great after a talk and a hug from tinathis coffee is so awesome you will want to bathe in it  you will want to stock pile it for the zombie apocalypse  you will probably buy a hand gun to protect your stash from other true coffee loversi cannot say enough good things about bareburger first let me begin by saying that i have been here twice so far and both times i have had the best burger in my entire life absolutely exceptional the quality of their food is top line the best  if you need convincing go to their website or better yet give it a try because i promise they will not disappoint their service is also great but they do get rushes and there could possibly be a wait depending on when you go to dine in the good thing about this place though is you can order to go if i lived in the area i would definitely order out all the time the restaurant itself is very clean its just a little small but its nice and intimate and the atmosphere is fun i would and have driven from the suburbs sat in traffic just to eat here  its that amazing for those who are looking for a vegan or gluten free place to eat this is it and for those who are looking for a delicious meal this is also the place the first time i went with a group of friends the manager stopped by several times to ensure we were getting nothing but great service i could go on and and on and on about how earth shattering their food is but i implore anyone who reads this to go also save room for dessert i know this can be challenging but their milkshakes are to die for what are you waiting for go nowexcellent food  great service  family owned and operated business and it shows  try the white pizza with broccoli rabe one of my favorite spots in tucson   the restaurant a romantic and dreamy atmosphere in a historic train depot they told me at my place of employment to be a womens libber  not rely on any prince charming coming along to take care of me whateverwhen he comes i want him to propose to me at maynards fabulous frenchinspired american cuisine sunday brunch is excellent i love the creamy white polenta  delish now that the weather has cooled down a bit you can still enjoy it outside with the toasty patio heaters  the bar great happy hour mondaysaturday from 3  6 pm its hard to find establishments with happy hour on the weekends they feature 7 bar eats and 12 off glasses of wine wells and drafts they usually have a couple of cocktail specials as well on my last visit i was pleased with a cocktail called tequilas dirty sister resposado raspberry habenero shrub grapefruit and bacanora it had a nice kick  the market after a brief construction hiatus although it seemed like an eternity to me they reopened at the beginning of november the first items i grabbed upon their return were sauted brussels sprouts w grapes from the deli case and a bottle of pinot grigio to go good choices im still making my way through trying some of the items in the newly designed market but i have especially loved the croque monsieur madame with a sunny egg and the raspberry cheesecake in a jar if you return the jar you get a 1 off your next purchase available seating has expanded in this new layout with more space to dinein i often come here just for grabandgo meals though i love the take out salads  sandwiches kale caesar superfruit grain portobello wgoat cheese sand etcyum you can also find isabellas ice cream and tucson tamale cos tamales in the freezer  the wine club 2 bottles a month 1 red 1 white 25 off cases free monthly tastings and discounts on wine dinners  60 for a 3 month membership or 230 for the year  the sommelier here is so very warm and friendly check it outi get the king soup every time i go it never disappoints great service friendly workers humble  owner authentic food and byob cant beat that the new fruit tarts they serve are a hit alsohave eaten here twice now on two separate trips to nashville and each meal has been fantastic the first trip i got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds delicious the second go round i got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven my son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic get there before 8 am and you shouldnt have to wait in the lines out the door make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well great experience and worth getting up early for probably worth the wait too but im not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip theremy dad and i went here as we were traveling up the i95 the food was really good and the server was really nice the food came quickly and the cesar salad that came with my meal was almost big enough to be dinner by itself it had a lot of croutons and dressing and parmesan on it which is always a good thing and the vegetable lasagna was delicious and probably enough to last me for 3 days i brought the leftovers with me they also gave us amazing bread one with cinnamon filling and one with cheese filling and there was enough of that to bring the extra bread in the car to snack on the strawberry shortcake i had for dessert was also delicious we also got a pound of cookies from the bakery area at the front and ive only had 2 of them so far but they are really goodgood value and great pizza  we stumbled upon the place last night after a long day of running around with my kids  8  10  kids menu was great  they loved it and a great deal including a drink with plenty of fries left over   i ordered a salad terrific but added a pizza to go after too much temptation  very very good  the staff was very attentive  seems to be family run and certainly putting a lot of effort into serving their cleinteleone of the best place to eat in the city and region the service is great the food is sooooo good and the decor is wonderful i have been here a few times but this time they had live music witch added to the experience  a place you must go to on the trendy girard avecome for the coffee  stay for the music   im not kidding about that i love this wawa i only go first thing in the morning and its a really fun way to start the day  the folks who work there or go there early in the morning are almost always friendly and the music always makes me smile i dont know if its some particular radio station thats on or if some genx manager has decided to craft their favorite mix but at 730am its a party and its awesomecant beat costco pricing for bulk purchases you have to use debit or cash unless you have their credit cardlove their latteand pastries  this was a great place i enjoyed my first time so much that it ended up being the only place i tried over the memorial day weekend  they opened everyday at 6am even on memorial day  giving them a 5 star nothing more to saythis place is amazing finally we have a great butcher in the bywater ive had their boudin andouille pork pat boudin stuffed chicken chicken stock bone marrow aged bonein ribeye italian meatballs and its all been 5 beans ive given their delectables as gifts and all have been thrilled the guys at shank will prepare your meats for the freezer as well  do yourself a favor and only shop with these wizardsi decided to try this place after a soup nazi type of lunch experience i had there in the fall aside from the divaness i wasnt incredibly wowed by my meal  i went for dinner with a friend since she had never been to this restaurant as always the decor is awesome i like the clean semicramped feeling   on to the food  i had the watermelon salad and the roasted bell pepper with lentils omg i would choose this meal as my preexecution fare if i were on death row  first off the watermelon salad was ridiculously delicious there were pieces of watermelon some radishes some other vegetable that i cant recall right now and slices of some unpronounceable white cheese those ingredients are kind of exciting on their own but what set that dish apart was the freaking oilbased dressing i dont know what they put on top of that salad but it just made the whole dish come together  the roasted bell pepper was enormous i didnt realize how big and filling that dish would be the bell pepper had some mix of lentils raisins cheese and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft im guessing goat cheese whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically  all told the total cost wasnt ridiculous for both items i think i paid almost 40 usd with tax and tip   given this experience that chef can be soup nazi if he wantswe used the party room for a bridal shower  the events manager deneva was wonderful to work with and followed through on every single detail  the wait staff was fantastic and the food was exceptional  we will definitely work with deneva for any future parties at cyranosstopped by here to get a few appetizers to go there was seating out front and a nice little back patio area and the bar went all around there was live music playing as well i got the gator tail with inferno sauce let me tell you i love love love spicy food but if you dont that inferno sauce is no joke so to all my mild spice friends out there be very careful it even came with some breaded hot peppers which also tasted great the gator was cooked perfectly also got the coconut rum shrimp  yum they were delicious and nice sized as well the jelly that came with them was delicious def will go back here when i visit clearwater againif you are going to the mall you have to check this place out  ordered a fish taco just to experience the flavor and quality  impressed with service friendly and ready to take your order  very very good quality of food  its not your average food place  its good   the double layer of taco with different crunch and flavor  perfect  fresh and flavorful and well worth the expense  you dont have a fish taco that falls apart like every other place  and the garnish melds perfectly with the taco great food well worth the price  those that know good food  go   dont pass this up  enjoyfabulous ice cream is delish pizza is crispy and the best we have had since chicago atmosphere is quintessential florida grab a beer and sit in the patio if you are leaving honeymoon island you must stop in we will definitely be back with friendsfirst time coming here and honestly one of the best ice cream shops in tampa such a cool and different style of serving ice cream and the choice of flavors sounded great will be coming back soonthis place is amazing so much more than a coffee shopbakery they offer a wide array of homemade pastries breakfast and of course coffee i partook a special americano concoction with turmeric and a shot of soy   i was blown away by the remodel the former church house feel is now a background setting for a more contemporary feel   the staff is friendly and laid back very helpful and the service was fastthe natural cafe no matter which one always has good food and great prices with fast service  and i love the fact that its healthy fresh foodthis place is amazing i literally think i died and went to heaven cant wait to go back  definitely recommend the juices the smoothies the vegan curry wrap and the kale salad mmmmmmmmmthis place is one of the best i have been to their other location in dunedin and it was completely different but both awesome in their own right clear sky on cleveland is a great spot for date night super chill atmosphere and awesome craft cocktails at the bar all of their food was super unique and an experience in itself i would definitely recommendthis restaurant is amazing we went for the first time last week after hearing great things from family and friends delicious coffee cocktails and entrees as well as a friendly staff and owner tucson finally has a fantastic breakfast restaurantdelicious king cakes both the chocolate and the traditionaldouble char burger with cheese and onion rings my to go stop in goletathis review is mostly about my friends dishes and the general impressions i got more so than my own personal taste  so for starters  i ordered the lobster roll the dish was not to my liking but thats because im not a fan of celery in lobster rolls the celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish i also found the lobster overdressed but some of this is just a matter of taste so i wont ding them hard for that  the rest of the food given the price was fantastic the crab and lobster were all fresh all cooked correctly and all at a price that worked   it is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood most are either way too expensive or way too sucky this is not one of themoh and if you stick only the donuts you are truly missing out the chicken sliders are phenomenal  meaty savory salty  sweet if they have the fried chicken biscuit when you go you must order it or else you hate americaawesome find in a strip mall location would not have found this place without yelp tons of gluten free breakfast options which is very hard to find i had the gluten free mounds of coconut pancakes they were amazing 2 large fluffy pancakes w coconut chocolate chips and chocolate syrup it was super also had an omelette w gruyere sausage caramelized onions also very goodbest beef noodles in town i love their beef noodle soup fried tofu chicken with basil i think almost all their food on their menu are really authentic taiwanese cuisine and another great deal is their price are very reasonable and affordable  place and environment are always clean im so happy for them that they expanded their place they have more tables now than beforei showed up here with 5 kids and 5 adults and the staff was so friendly accommodating and super patient the chicken cheesesteaks are amazing and the fries are crispy and seasoned well they had chocolate and vanilla ice cream for all of the kids too it was my first time here i love the wild boar burger with the duck bacon omg it was so interesting duck bacon i never heard of it before ill be going back i also sweet potato friesoh my god incredible you will not regret it theres always a long line and its worth the wait be adventurous and try as many pancake flavors as you can they wont disappoint  1010 best pancake place around its a mustthis is a delightful warm and sunny bakery with amazing treats and coffee this morning i had the lemon feta scone delicious not too sweet or heavy i brought home a bacon chocolate chip cookie but ate it on the way home terrifically delightful  you must try any of there bakery goods they wont disappointwow magnificent sunday brunch i promise you wont be disappointed great drinks as wellpopped in here for lunch after yelp alerted me of its opening you almost would drive past it on broad ripple avenue but please dont the sandwich menu is extensive and amazing i had a pork sandwich with grilled onions and mojito marinade the pork was hand carved from tenderloins recently cooked with fresh baked bread delicious while we were eating the owner came out with samples of his black bean soup which he makes daily possibly one of the best black bean soups i have tried he then generously brought over some of his home made carmel flan which was so rich it should be illegal but just as delicious as everything else i will definitely be going back here to try more sandwiches nothing negative to say about this place top notch very friendly owner and employees truly feel like you are in cubatried two of the many available and all i can say is wow this stuff they call mead is very good the goober vitis taste just like that childhood favorite in liquid form and the raspberry was amazing believe the hype and give this place a shot you will not be disappointed  day 2 update next up orange blossom if you live in florida and or have ever experienced the smell of the blossoms you will enjoy this one of course i had to order one more before heading back to fort lauderdale the ol lenurb di tamiami a sangiovese wine mead was also amazing four out of four for the weekend with each one different than the next  this will be a definite stop on my trips to the bay areabetsys cupcakes are the best anywhere there are so many different flavors  they are filled  she also supports many good causes like autism i have always purchased them from the farmers markets but now there is a great shop i love the train station location thanks betsythis is hands down the best place to get gourmet coffee that isnt overpriced its cheaper if you drink your coffee there versus getting it to go and trust me youll want to stay unless youre in a hurry the cafe itself is pretty big and has 2 areas that are separated by the counterkitchen they also have a bar hence the name and a food menu their desserts are generously proportioned and theres a wide selection to choose from my friend and i tried the oversized snickerdoodle cookie which was pretty decent for a standard cookie soft and chewy and not overly sweet the staff was very friendly and flexible definitely a place ill have to come back toi go here a lot i really cant beat wawa coming from the midwest all i knew before was 711 but wawa takes the cake  you can get madetoorder delicious subs cold soft drinks and even make your own verion of a dq blizzard right here in wawa  i usually hit up the breakfast specials which consist of a bagels or croissant sandwich hashbrowns coffees etc its constantly changing but always yummy lets just say theres no calories in this meal  oh  how could i forget to mention  the coffee bar they have about 8 different kinds of alwaysfreshlybrewed coffee and plenty of sweeteners flavors and milkish products to add into the mix yumi would rarely just drop by a restaurant that i see on an interstate billboard  cant believe i have never been to this bbq joint great atmosphere enjoyed the turnover and corn casserole  if the whole wait staff work like tyler this place will become my favorite  the stl sauce is much more like a memphis vinegar based sauce and reminds me of corkys  ill be back and bring the familythe food was excellent the service was excellent the atmosphere was excellent this is just what downtown needs to transform the area great farm to table food that tastes great i got the short rib and an old fashion and it was terrific will definitely come back againgreat date night place cant wait to go back we ate at the bar and enjoyed apps and a shared entree great service for a new spotgreat people the cubano is the best in town worth going out of your way to check it outwe had a group of five so a long wait was expected they went over the wait time they told us because the people at the table before us were just chatting and the manager personally came out and apologized he also offered us three pastries for free which were delicious the food was amazing as well cant go wrong by choosing this place the staff was extremely kind and went out of their way to make sure our experience was the best it could be highly recommendgood place for a good breakfast and coffee  simple wholesome and good service what else can one ask for breakfast if you are visiting new orleans at the french quarter and looking for a good place to start your day then that this is the place for you  recommendedgot tacos with a lemonade and my girlfriend got tacos with a horchata everything was very tasty and they had a nice selection of homemade salsas overall  good reasonably priced tacos and a friendly staffthis is by far one of my favorite spots i get a bowl from here at least once a week the food is very good quality and so convenient its quick easy and a healthy choice compared to other drive thru places my only constructive criticism is they do not add enough of the toppings and sauce  i usually have to order extra best bowl place in townthis was our first pizza place in philly and we loved it pizza tastes great thickness is perfect i think the best part is the variety they have on the menu in particular the create your own salad option is amazing so many choices and you get a huge custom salad can easily be shared between 4 people wings were also very good as was the blue cheese dressing that came with it  wish there was free delivery instead of a charge but its only 175 so not too bad prices are very reasonable and quality is greatabsoulutely loved the ambience of this place the food was beyond delicious and i was blown away by the dessert also service was very goodi have lived in tampa for 9 years and just ate here i have been seriously missing out this is a great place to eat everything here is very clean and healthy organic free range grass fes etc i had a club wrap and it was delicious so glad i found this placedefinitely try the  beef yakamein delicious super savory simple i wish i had the recipe a great soup any time of daywe had the pepperoni pie and the crispy artichokes the pie was really good it had a lot of pepperoni and the cheesesauce ratio was perfect the crust had a nice crispychewy contrast they are small neapolitan pies so i would recommend 1 pie and 1 appetizer for two people the crispy artichokes were very good they were complimented with a lemon yogurt sauce and a black olive tapenade i would definitely go back      just updating review after going back i changed it to 5 stars everything was excellent the kale salad octopus ribs and bianca verde pizza were all amazing cant wait to go backhad the gyro salad and it was large filling and delicious service was quick and super friendly the menu had a lot of tasty looking options and i hope to try more soon great value tooi can see why this place was on the top 25  yelp for 2017 so delicious and almost everything is made in house the owner is friendly and our food was fast i got the chicken club and my husband got the molldeli special we both loved it will definitely be back my husband got us signed up for this class as a surprise for my birthday and it was hands down one of my favorite experiences   mike and yoon were very personable and made the cooking class a one of a kind experience   we went for the claw and order and got to make manhattan and new england clam chowder we also got to make a low country boil and cheesy pull apart bread not only was everything delicious but it was interactive and engaging   we had a blast to say the least we plan on taking more classeswhole foods meets mcdonalds i needed a quick bite chipotle was closed and i decided to try this new place so glad i did   locally sourced menu with photos of the farmers in the restaurant a menu that includes kale smoothies and veggie burgers as well as burgers and sandwiches  i ordered the el guapo chicken sandwich with bacon homemade jalapeno ranch lettuce tomato and onion which was a little too hot for me next time i would try a different sandwich the sandwich was good though  as for the price its the same price as places like panera smashburger and five guys   definitely give this place a chanceweve been to tarpon springs many times over the years and have eaten at many of the greek restaurants but this one is by far superior  from the food to the service we ordered the octopus which came with a plethora sides childrens greek spaghetti and a greek salad  even the house wine was very smooth  hellas is excellent and will be our go to place from now on  wish we wouldve visited soonerlifechanging pancakes amazing selection and the waitresses tshirts were really funny also loved the decorwho knew i would lives grocery store so much ive been to a few publix grocery stores before but this one is by far the best one they have an awesome deli section that has a wide selection of everything i love that they have 10 different types of hummus what grocery store gives you that much variety exactly no other lol but theres also a ton of different salads chicken salads potatoe salads salsa etcjust so much i love this storewe were really surprised about this place we had no idea what to expect we didnt realize it is a vietnamese restauaurant but we love all asian food  decided to try it plus they have tons of boba drinks to choose from  yum the place was pretty busy even on an off time of day and i always think if im in an ethnic restaurant and there are a lot of customers of that ethnicity then it must be pretty good  we both really liked it a lotwonderful new fusion restaurant in town i came here because of all the instagram posts and the high ratings on yelp i was expecting a great meal and i was not disappointed the menu is concise and everything sounds tasty   the sticky chicken wings are a must the sauce on them is super addicting i wish i could buy a bottle of it the kimchi burger is a great twist on an american favorite i cant wait to return to try their chicken and waffles also if you saved any room for dessert make sure to try their pandan waffles with green tea ice cream off menu item i was stuffed and didnt think i could take another bite but as soon as i tasted their dessert i didnt stop till it was all goneim so happy i found this place  they have such a good selection of flowers for bouquet arrangements  its about 1 a stem but theyve got gerbera daises sunflowers hygrangeas tulips so pretty  i was shocked at all the different things they have in there  they have a section of cool recipe books papyrus cards neat little gadgets for your home  seafood section has ahi steak for 22lb  any place that has ahi steak  wholefoods is the other is a winner in my book since i wanna make my own spicy tuna hand rolls without mashed up ahi    oh be careful if you decide to buy exotic fruits  the rambutans they were selling were 10lb which is understandable since they may be difficult to find out here in tucsonbut the selection they had were alli repeat all brown and dried upthe kind that my mother would forbid us to eat as children  normally rambutans are red on outsidebrown is not a good sign  they have a huuuuuge wine section and the clerk is so very helpful  i was looking for a lambrusco and since they were out of that she helped me find a different italian sweet red wine the adessa  that was deeeelish  the prices of goods here are about 50 cents to a dollar more than other places for the same item if u could find it elsewhere but i still love it    oh and their desserts look so good  i love dark organic looking supermarkets especially ones that have designated parking for expecting mothers  haha  they doa truly great fresh seafood place my favorite is the crabcakes and royal red shrimp hogfish is fresh and amazing and i used the clams to make clams casino on new years eve so good service is great and the seafood is yummywow  very friendly staff  the clam chowder was wonderful and so were the crab cakeslocal ice cream stand in business for over 55 years homemade ice cream amazing milkshakes and chili cheese dogs are must try items on the menu bring cash they dont accept plastichan dynasty has the best chinese food around its spicy when its supposed to be spicy and not sweet when it shouldnt becute italian marketdeli place came across this place while yelping for a place for lunch we got some sandwiches to go and some cold side dishes prices are pretty reasonable oh and dont forget the dessert bar just walking by it made my mouth water yum  theres a seating area outdoor but if its too hot there are limited seating inside by the coffee bar inside the market theres also a cheese and wine room where they have assortment of cheeses and friendly staff there to answer all your cheese and wine questions fantastic  ive had everything and its all fantastic  love their experimental menus  people are awesome and friendly  they are very clean as well  you cant go wrong with anything you get  i see a lot of reviews for the tea but the coffee wins hands down   lately i have really been enjoying the short rib tacos  they are great  i really like the curry but its so much food i cant usually finish it and i hate wasting   there is always a wait but its worth it    this is where its at people if there were open on the weekends or had a restuarant id eat there even more this was my first time here and i can say i wasnt disappointed though it was questionable as to whether id be able to get in the restaurant as the door latch mechanism broke and nobody could get in or out a good samaritan diner helped them get the door open finally but it was quite funny   im glad i waited for the door because the food was wonderful great flavors and plenty left over the spring rolls were fresh and tasty and the mongolian bed was spot on not too spicy but certainly not bland the sesame chicken is some of the best ive tasted in years with a great balanced sauce not too sweet and very nicely crisped chicken im looking forward to another visit for the phoi cant believe this place isnt busier a hidden gem my husband and i visited for breakfast hoping they might have a good breakfast sandwich they have a full breakfast menu i had the greek omelet which was awesome service was exceptional seating inside and out with a nice water view great value be sure to check it out sorry we didnt discover it soonerbest bagels around for sure the vegetable cream cheese is to die for and i love that they put the toppings on both sides of the bagel so that there is not good side or bad sideits nice to see a lot more vietnamese restaurants opening in the city especially uptown you can never have too many options mint is located right next to dat dog a pleasant new addition to the freret scenery it offers authentic vietnamese dishes with savory traditional flavors you can find yourself a really good bowl of pho or plate of com ga roti rice w rotisserie chicken here they even offer brown rice as a healthier alternative which i was really excited about the menu also offers some items with a different flair such as the kim chi burger and chicken with green tea waffles which ill definitely be back to try if youre really brave you can try one of their specialty cocktails that contains fish sauce in the mix i love how nicely the decor was done from the chandeliers to the cute tea cups there seems to be a good selection of wine which you can enjoy at their spacious bar counter if youre in need of some down time i had a nice glass of chardonnay and spring rolls awesome sauce literally while waiting for friends the name was chosen well as mint is one of the cooking staples in vietnamese cuisine their friendly staff and atmosphere will definitely bring me back for frequent visitsso happy to have this in my neighborhood we ordered lamb vindaloo chicken tikka masala and papadum for take away and were really pleased with the whole experience from the nice guy at the counter to the food quickly being ready the recipe they use for the masala sauce was a little different from and better than the typical one ive had at countless places in different cities over the years the chicken was super tender that dish was the star of the meal the lamb wasnt quite as tender as i expected though not tough by any means and the vindaloo was tasty and satisfying the papadam wasnt quite crisp enough given that it was still warm and clearly freshly made but still addictive overall id say 45 stars will definitely be back many times and look forward to exploring the menudefinitely a must do for stl visitors touring the brewery was fascinating enlightening and surprisingly free  brewmaster tour was sold out but that gives us something to plan ahead for next time wished for more

goodif you live in brandon you know that its a challenge to find a place to eat that is not a chain restaurant or doesnt have a drivethrough window from the exterior you might think this place does back woods human organ removal late night and the inside isnt going to blow you away either but thats where the negativity ends with this story folks not only are their bagels and other assorted delicacies ridiculously delicious but every menu item is inexpensive and almost be hooves you to want to purchase more items get there early or your favorite bagels will be sold out before the clock

get out you whiny hipsters you will not be disappointedmy favorite go to takeaway spot the ingredients are fresh and delish ever since i tried poke ive been hooked you wont regret giving this place a shoti cant remember when ive heard the perfect soundtrack playing in any bar or store there was an ambience to this place that prompted my friend and i to sit for hours and chat about life while eating amazing gelato the portions were a decent size for the price and the staff were generally friendlymy cousin recommended this place to me and i was a little skeptical at first but oh my goodness this place is divine  it was very crowded since we went on a friday night but we asked to sit outside and got seated immediately the atmosphere was very nice inside theres a huge aquarium and we stood there and looked at it for about 20 minutes lol they had really cool decor then when we went outside there was a big stone fountain which was beautiful our server was very prompt and always made sure we had what we needed now on to the food  you know how when you taste something really good and you just cant help but let out a mmmmmm well thats how it was for me i had the texas cheese fries for an appetizer oh goodness they were amazing and there were tons of them the peach tea  amazing grilled salmon  amazing and the sides ah i had corn and mashed potatoes and broccoli cheese casserole they were so good plus the prices were surprisingly low for the quality  i love this place and ill definitely go againgreat gelato and philly cheese steak and crepes awwsomereally good you wont be disappoontedpretty darn good  great service food was good  it was a great change from noshville where we ate the morning before  there was a short wait but we beat the sunday crowd and the service was friendly and swift  the breakfast was very good  blueberry pancakes for my friend eggs and cheese grits for mewith one silver dollar pancake just so i could taste what theyre known for  will definitely return if i have the opportunity someone at a nearby table spilled a glass of milk  no problem  servers were there in an instant to clean up all with good naturethe crocremes are amazing and addictive i havent tried much else from the bakery but that alone is worth returning forhad the chicken shawarma and it was fantastic all the ingredients were nice and fresh and the food was so cheap great place to grab takeout on a week nightgreat little neighborhood coffee shop walked here from my airbnb on a rainy day enjoyed a macchiato and blueberry muffin before heading to the french quarter recommended if youre looking for a cute place to grab coffee or chill out on a rainy dayi literally just finished the sandwich i picked up from sliced and i have to say  its one of the best sandwiches ive ever had  i had the classic italian sub toasted and just wow  the meats were just delicious  the cheese the bread the veggies  ive had italian subs lots of places and this is by far the best  i will be back often  i also had a side salad  the zeus  and it was really fresh and tasty but i do have one small piece of advice  the veggies needed to be sliced a bit smaller  i love the big fresh veggies but they were hard to eat without taking the time to cut everything into smaller pieces which is not great when youre trying to have a fairly quick and simple lunchdiscovered say cheese at the running of the santas  this is a place i will definitely be following   the say cheese is delicious with perfectly done grilled cheese the slight saltiness is perfect with the gouda cheese   the standout is the chicken bleua must get small grilled pieces of chorine with homemade buffalo sauce get ityoure welcomecame here for the first time today and was not disappointed  my cousin and i both got the coco feine their specialty drink and recommended by the barista  it was absolutely delicious  the coconut flavor really shined through and the flakes of toasted coconut were wonderful  the shop itself is absolutely adorable and it is very reasonably priced  i will definitely return to hang out  im looking forward to the spring and summer when i can sit outside with a nice cup of iced coffeeagain i cant say enough about this place just split the phili salmon cram cheese and spinich and honeybee and the mochacino food is so good here and staff are great as well cant wait to visit againlooks can be deceiving i love the carne asada tacos carmello is good sonora dogs are good everything here is good you must try iti could come here every day  the ice cream is fresh creamy with imaginative flavors that range from traditional to crazy and i havent had a clinker yet  just today i had lavender honey my husband toffee butterscotch and my daughter red velvet cake  there are places to sit both inside and outside i bet this place is very busy when its hot outside  there are about ten house sundaes you can choose and if you want your choice of composition there are about twenty different toppings for your delectation  nuts sprinkles and other toppings are available  if youd like a birthday cake they make them  if you want to take home a pint or quart you can do that too  this is now our goto ice cream parlor in new orleansthe best prices and best quality donair i have had in ages quality ingredients your choice of meat and sauce and ingredients awesome selection on top of awesome prices and you cannot go wrong 1010 would recommend only downside was the lineup at prime time for lunch 1230 however did get in and out within 15 minutesthe store smells amazing when you walk in  we loved the tourtes or turtles i think thier called the pecan candy apple is literally the best candy apple i ever hadi had my daughters going away party at the depot last week and it was awesome  when the manager heard why we were there he personally came over and gave his congratulations to her and wished her well on her new journey  we had drinks and appetizers and both were fantastic  i have been to the depot on many occasions and they have never let me down the ambiance is fantastic and the food and drink are equally as good  it is a place i go to often to meet friends

they are very friendly  i will be back again and again as it is the to go place for great food and drinks in renothe other big french bread bakery in the city  they dont get the press or the market share of leidenheimers but are still really good  again this is the bakery but they may have a retail store where you can actually purchase itemsat least they did once upon a time  look for binders at your local grocerywonderful fresh hot meals sandwiches and salads we were looking for a healthy alternative to fast food on our road trip through nashville and were so pleased to find the cafe my kids loved their berry berry salad and green beans we were too full to try their deserts but they looked delicious we will definitely stop here againwe visit every weekend for breakfast its a very nice and cozy cafe with good food and great service free wifi too we recommend it 100been to mod pizza once and the experience was something to remember we went around lunch time and the service was great i love how you can choose what toppings you want and the good guys at mod pizza bake to order defiantly will be returning in the near future to mod pizzai recently contracted cory to make cookies as a gift to the guests at my daughters wedding  i sent him a picture of what i wanted them to look like and they were far and above what i provided  i was expecting a simple standard sugar cookie but they were so much richer than that  guests ravednot sure what else to say that others havent said already  they have excellent italian baked goods a small bit of grocery items and they make outstanding sandwiches at their deli countergreat food i had ordered 4 for on the road and request the veggie in a different bag and in toasted it this way you can toast it at home if you live 2 hours away like me had three there with a few friend must try the shaved ice its amazing friendly and good service do not serve other people before you based on ethnicity like thuy cafe down the streeti dont go here for the mexican i go for the cheese which is the best selection in the area the cheese is fresh not shrinkwrapped they know the cheeses and offer samples and while there are plenty that are there every week they get new ones in i love stopping by and trying new stuff  the smooth and the ultrastanky  and finding good cheeses ive never had before the staff are very friendly especially if you want to learn about cheese try the awesome bruderbasil smoked cheesei yelped lunch and ippolitos seafood was the 2nd option with only one dollar sign despite the great rating i was still a little nervous to try out cheap seafood but i learned 2 things from this place  1 its not cheap its affordableextremely affordable  2 in addition to their amazing and fresh produce my favorite part about ippolitos is the menu such a great variety of delicious seafood  the shrimp roll is amazing a toasty brioche bun filledand i mean filled they dont joke aroundwith delicious fresh shrimp that pop in your mouth with every bite  the salmon burger is off the hook too  the best of philly their famous crab cake sandwich  and the people that work here are super nice too ask them about each menu and they give you a detailed rundown of what it is and how its prepared   i go here almost every day for lunch nowits healthy incredibly delicious and oh did i mention its ridiculously affordablethese pralines are the best i tried while in new orleans the store itself could use some artwork or decoration but dont let that fool you this place is the bomb  guys working inside were super friendly too which is always nicetheir ribs are falloffthebone tender and pulled pork is so damn good just tried the baked beans today and they are simply delicious  my new favorite spot in seminole heightswe have relocated to columbia but whenever we come back into st louis donut drivein is one of our first stops  love it when we time it just right glazed just iced and oh so gooey  the buttercream filled donut is beyond amazing and worth having to get up early never had a bad donut here  some days might be better than others but still never disappointed drooling while anticipating our next trip into stlomg i love there coconut macaroons i just couldnt stop eating i also got cookie monster cupcake and again love love love itjust tried this place today and wow  now thats a tasty burger  like from my childhood good i think theyre much better than in and out or five guys  which taste like paper to me plus that freddys sauce is to die for and the staff was helpful and nice too great find we will be backamazing indian food flavors most of us have never tasted before very friendly crew will come back over and over and over againgreat food and great service everything was delicious i recommend it 100  definitely we will comeback againno loud collegebro music good food and coffee these guys get it  i only wish the floor in the back area was quieter but they do everything else greatlocal diner style restaurant with a menu reminiscent of what you would find in ny or chicago greek diners it is a staple with many temple terrace residents   the food is good the staff pleasant and the portion sizes an incredible value everything is cooked fresh to order   try it youll like itgreat local roaster boasting a cozy coffeehouse vibe reminiscent of seattle in the 90s theres no formal register and the one or two employees running the show seemingly hang out in the open area where you get your fresh cup of pour over style coffee  great spot to work away the afternooni would say i am a pretty critical eater sweet potato pancakes are the best breakfast food i have ever tasted friendly staff with great stories i feel like i had a cultural experience as well as great food that tells the story of the town history thank you pancake pantryi dont generally consider myself to be a huge fan of candy  give me a slice of chocolate cake or a donut and im in heaven but candy i can usually take or leave  that is i didnt consider myself a huge fan of candy until i was introduced to the work of souther candymakers and in particular their rum praline  is it traditional  i dont care  adding all of that brown sugar and pecan goodness to the flavor of rum is a stroke of unmitigated genius  we stopped three times in a five day period and took home many many of these little lovelies to the folks back home all of whom raved  i also tried their regular praline which in the rather narrow band of praline flavor was very good  the sweet potato brought in cinnamon and a surprising bit of sweet potato flavor  but neither comes even close to that rum praline  it was disappointing to my bank account to find out that they ship all over the us too  in lieu of flying back for some ill be availing myself of this service very soonexcellent brewery  always a wide selection of small batch beer to satisfy any palate always eager to help educate those seeking a better knowledge of beers and brewing  often on tap is dpg one of the best ipas to be found in towncome for the empanadas stay for the cocktails really fabulous food also had the paella which was delicious i dream about the empanadas very trendy space with an amazing rooftop patio wish they took open table reservations id eat here every weekendi would let you punch me in the kidneys if you brought me some gelato  the flavors are seasonal but everything here is delicious  none of the flavors taste awkward or forced  even the kiwi gelato was delicious  have you ever tried adding kiwi to a milkshake  dont  let the flavor craftsmen at frost handle it for you  they wont disappoint  the creamy gelatos and refreshing sorbettos are all great  i have literally sampled every single flavor they have to offer except the diabetic flavors i want sugar in my dessert  the fruity flavors taste light and vibrant while the ones that you would want to be dense are so velvety and rich cheesecake tiramisu etc    the service is always friendly and eager to help  the bathroom is spotless and even the outdoor seating is regularly checked on for cleaning  the inside is sleek and modern  my only gripes would be the price and the seeds in the blackberry cabernet flavor its still delicious the seeds are distracting though  its not as cheap as dq but it is much better  it is also much cheaper than cold stone but more satisfying  its impossible to leave this place without a smile  easily one of my favorite places in tucson for any occasioni travel to and through st louis a few times a year and ted drewes is a muststop always a big crowd but the friendly staff know how to move the people and keep the custard coming so dont let a large crowd keep you from stopping by i try a different specialty of theirs every time i go and im never disappointed just the best custard ever very high quality ingredients and if i lived in st louis they would get a large portion of my income as i wouldnt be able to help myself from going constantly and did i mention how reasonably priced they are i love this placeif u want a some deal use the coupon out of the discovery indy coupon u only save a dollar not with it it was more before the change  it has a great smell when u walk inwe finally made it over to snola and it was worth it  the cheesecake stuffed snoball blows the regular  ice cream stuffed snoball out of the water absolutely delicious and worth the drive into metairie the parking lot is a tad tricky for parking but you wont be sorry holy crap they really are freaky fast they got all the additions and subtraction to my sandwiches right even though the guy didnt have a ticket for my order to go from super sweet and very helpful  ps my sandwich was deliciousthe donuts are amazing but youd be doing yourself a disservice if you didnt order something with the praline bacon the egg bacon biscuit is as delicious as it is instagram worthy the coffee holds its own too district donuts was the highlight of our visit so fargreat sandwiches the people are friendly the bread is great the sandwiches are amazing  order the primo and you wont be disappointed this is the best bbq place in these parts the sandwiches the brisket and the ribs are amazing side are so good beans and corn bread you can not go wrong the special sandwich of brisket smoked pork and smoked turkey with smoked cheese on top might be the best sando in albertawhats not to love about bings boba  this place has everything  1 freshly made boba with the right mouthfeel 2 fast and friendly service 3 the prices are right 4 clean facilities and establishment 5 card games board games couches and plenty of seating 6 loyalty card  buy 10 drinks and get the 11th free  they really do a fantastic job with iced teas w boba  im talking about any iced tea thai matcha hong kong hibiscus you name it i have tried them all without any sweeteners and they are simply fantastic  thats when you know its good seriously yummy pizza had the pancetta and pineapple and feel like that will be a staple for me mouth is watering thinking about it love the outdoor deck great little pizza place in walking distance from my housethis is not my neighbourhood liquor store and i didnt just stumble in one day i on purpose sought out sherbrooke after it came recommended so many times by friends and acquaintances  the beer selection at sherbrooke is seriously unmatched by anywhere ive been in the city or in calgary where i used to live actually i love the way the shelves are organized and how full they are whether i am searching for something annoyingly specific or just kind of want to pick up a bunch of new single pints to try sherbrooke is always always the first place i think to look this is also now a destination of sorts when friends and family are visiting gone are the days where we spend our days at popular edmonton attractions now its pho down the street then beer shopping at sherbrooke sorry mom i have also been told that they label their vegan wines though i am much more of a craft beer girl myself so havent really perusedive driven past this restaurant literally 100 times today we decided to stop for lunch after our excursion at lowry park zoo from the getgo you can tell the owner and staff take pride in the location landscaping neat parking lot clean and fresh paint on the building all signs that the restaurant is producing a profit which means theyre filling the seats our server was very good she was busy but never forgot us always pleasant and always smiling helpful and informative we were seated promptly drink orders taken with a feta appetizer on its way it came with fresh tomatoes cucumbers onions seasoned to perfection and with the best feta ive ever had at a restaurant it had superb feta taste but was very smooth almost soft very delicious and plenty of it to eat with your meal if you wanted we ordered our meals i ordered a chicken gyro with a greek salad my wife ordered an eggplant parm sub and we got the kids meal ham  cheese sandwich for my daughter my chicken gyro was exactly what i expected tender chicken seasoned with dill and oregano the tzatziki had a good garlic bite the tomatoes and onions were fresh overall a very good wrap the only suggestion i have would be to serve it wrapped instead of open faced it makes it a little difficult to eat the salad was very very good they didnt skimp on the tomatoes and cucumbers plenty to enjoy on the salad the homemade dressing was not masked with sugar it was a thick greek dressing with herbs that brought out the taste of the salad didnt overpower it i highly recommend it the rice served with the gyro was so tasty it reminded me of the rice i used to eat in the old greek diners in new york very moist and full of flavor i sampled a bit of my wifes eggplant sub it was very well made toasted roll skinned sauted eggplant with a very flavorful sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese she thoroughly enjoyed the meal with such hearty portions she had plenty to go home with my daughters meal was the one that spoke volumes to me many restaurants use the kids meal as an excuse to put together a sub standard sloppy basket of fries with a sandwich that you never take home because the dog deserves better this place made a kids meal that was really a meal we ordered the ham  cheese sandwich it came with a hearty helping of their delicious fries tasty ham quality cheese on another one of their toasted rolls all under 5 youre kidding right way to go stefanos for being one of the very few places to serve a delicious sizable kids meal on a budget all together an incredibly good place to eat for a mediterranean meal we will definitely be back pricing was very fair especially considering the portions we brought a lot home go to stephanos you will not be disappointedi am in town for work and a few of my local counterparts brought me to this restaurant i wasnt sure what to expect but can i honestly say it was far better than so expected the crab and bacon rangoon was excellent and the pork couldnt have been better the service was also excellent i will definitely be visiting this place againthe pineapple fried rice that i ordered was very delicious also service is good and the environment is very positivewell worth the drive from downtown the custard here is really spectacular the employees here are so sweet too my family and i had no idea how concretes work so the kind lady who helped us explained everything and made suggestions about what we should get   i particularly enjoyed the foxtreat raspberries macademia nuts and hot fudge yum the prices are a little on the higher side so its best to just get the biggest size and split it with everyone or take it all for yourself ppizza was great and they included cups in the delivery for the two liter along with plates without me asking  i thought that was nice and very helpfulfirst time coming here the service was great server holly was great i came with my grand kids she was ver tentative to them the food service was quick quality of food was great cooked by chef kyle golden bucket was a great  plus i added a lobster for 999 wow we are from chicago best sea food in tampa if your looking for a great priced burger and you havent been here well go you wont be disappointed i love yo add avocado on my burgers and its even better  try it i worked closely with angie at rincon catering for my wedding at the santa barbara zoo they are the mandatory catering company which initially could feel like a compromise in going with the venue but they are actually awesome i had a family friend who had heard great things and they definitely delivered angie was super helpful every step of the way they did a large tasting event and it was a perfect way to choose appetizers and entrees as well as decor we heard the food was some of the best most people had ever had at a wedding which is every brides dream to hear  i would highly recommend themalways delicious lots of options for dietary restrictions and a great price  the red velvet were a hit at my fiances birthday partyi just found out about this place ive been eating really bad and i was craving fruit i was told this place does fruit bowls i got the watermelon pineapple kiwi strawberry bowl they offered to put chili and lime over the top as this is how most people my husband included eat it i didnt get the chili and lime but the fruit was amazing im such a fan i will be going back to check out what other things they offerhidden gem  best french dip ever  relaxed place with great food and nice ownerswent to dinner here with friends and cant help but question the folks who said they had terrible service or so so food we had an exceptional waiter who truly knew the food the wine and wasnt afraid to make recommendations loved him very professional the ambiance was excellent too i do enjoy the bright lights modern feel of some of tucsons newer restaurants but this was a nice break from that for dinner at least it was low lighting elegant real tucson feel the place was hopping there was light jazz played live the drinks were amazingthe food outstanding my friends can be somewhat hard to pleaseand maynards wowed them im going back today for lunch with coworkers and hope its as goodwithout the dinner menu have heard great things about the cuban style pulled pork sandwich  okupdate cuban pork sandwich is amazing slow roasted melt in your mouth pork on a delicious ciabatta bread with spicy mayonnaise fresh cilantro roasted jalapenoscant go wrong very nice to sit on the patio in the afternoon tooi cant say enough of this place  i had lunch again at my favorite chinese restaurant today  i was in a rush so had to order something simple yet covered my favorite meats duck roast pork chicken  i was not disappointed  great flavor and bulls eye on the crispy skin  i can eat here every day and twice on sunday  shame they are closed on tuesday  the service was good  portions were decent for the price  i just ordered one plate  my usual days would have been 45 entrees  not that i am a big eater or big in stature but i like ordering plenty  one has to be a plate of roast pork  i do not think i have had one bad dish in the all the times i have dined here  the bakery is super fabulous  i always leave with a bag of their desserts  i just wish there were more parking on grand  going again this weekendbig fan of this place and dont know why its not overflowing with people aside from the many delicious burgersandwich items on the menu you can create your own burger with a huge array of options to choose from including bison wild boar and elk the space inside is open light and airy a little kitschy albeit they have a bar in the back and a few tvs also spaced around the restaurant servers were friendly and attentive great place for a good quality burgerthe service was wonderful  the barista was pleasant and greeted me right away when i walked in i tried the ham and cheese croissant  it was delicious i also love the variety of drinks available a great experience for sureoh yeah  free tours of americas beer this educational and informative tour takes you through three national landmarks the stops in the free tour include clydesdales brewing packaging and hospitality make sure you hit it early to avoid the large tours i would pop for the brewmaster tour which is limited to 10 people but you need to plan in advance this is a must do in st louis the staff are kind knowledgeable and have great tips on other st louis happeningsthis place was great  we visited on a monday and it was veggie day so our vegetarian sandwiches were 499 normally 649  the gentleman who was working was very polite and patient in answering our questions and even providing a sample of the dall    we tried the falafel wrap and the dall wrap  both were delicious  their food is obviously homemade and healthy  we especially liked their white and red cabbages fresh veggies and their hot sauces  both the mild and hot sauces seemed equally hot so use with caution  the falafel was freshly fried and it was a nice mix of moist and crispy    hands down one of the better mediterranean places weve been  well be back for suregreat pizza with fast delivery i love their gluten free crust as welllove the authenticity of their food guacamole is great to the beef tacos creamy chipotle chicken taste deliciousamazing delicious and well priced they were super kind and helpful since this was my fiancs and my first time we pretty much for a little

mf good  plus i was mad that i didnt come here soonermy bf is a native cantonese from hong kong and this is our fav chinese restaurant in st louis beef chow fun dry is my usual staple menu item here because its the best in st louis their menu offerings cater mostly to nonchinese tastes as most asian restaurants in the us do but this place will prepare any authentic cantonese dish you request if

thank you so much again carol for making it a perfect dayok i am so not joking i luv this place soo much me and my fiance go there every weekend its our weekly routine dream tea house is def by far the best bubble tea around the staff are so nice and its like a feelgood thing to do from the enviroment to the people to everything bubble tea the shaved ice yummmo0gotta share the shaved ice thou its monster big the one is west ed is more of a quick thing the one off of whyte is more of a hang out place oh n on the southside one the hours are great my fav is sunflower mango strawberry with sago n i think its pineapple jelly soo good just walking in to this place makes me smilefantastic every time every bite any breakfast sandwich on croissant with a glazed donuts is a dream come truethese people are so nice as we came in a worker was cleaning the front door the big man who made our food helped my son with his order they had exactly what my wife likes as they were able to improvise since she is rather high maintenancethe all you can eat is amazing try a little bit of everything and have as much as you want for 20 you definitely cant beat the price and the food is creative and theres plenty of variety definitely worth checking outim a rather skeptical of new restaurants and usually will wait until the masses have been before i venture in the door  was in ofallon il last monday night and finished about 9 pm so a friend of mine and i decided to try cheddars on route 159 in fairview heights il  walked in at 9 pm and there was still a 30 minute wait for a dining room table even on a school night    so we decided to sit at the bar for immediate seating  best thing we did  jessica immediately made us feel at home and helped to explain their concept and certain dishes that she enjoys  i had the cagen chicken with black beans and chopped tomatoes    sounds rather boring but the taste was amazing  and the entire dish had only 490 calories  jessica suggested we try one of the 99 desserts  i had the strawberry shortcake and it too was amazing  cant be the price right  so when it came time to return to ofallon il last night  we had to go to cheddars  we walked in at 930 pm on a saturday night and it was full but we also ate in the bar again this time  we walked in and a server we used to have at chavas in soulard is now working at the bar in cheddars  great to see steven again  had the same exact dishes as we did monday night and i cant wait to go to cheddars again real soon    my only complaint is that the restaurant is beautiful    sometimes the food takes a long time one you order to get your order served    and the lighting is too dark with the dark woodwork in the restaurant  they need to retrofit their halogen lighting to led mr16 bulbs  can you tell im in that business  lol  love cheddars and cant wait to go again    but sit at the bar for immediate seatingkanella is an excellent greekcypriot restaurant i have been there multiple times with both family as well as friends and each time i continue to be impressed the dips of the day are amazing i dont think there are better dips at any restaurant in the city some of my other favorite dishes are fried halloumi grilled sardines grilled whole fish shrimp saganaki ortiki cyprus mixed kebab and kouneli the desserts are definitely worth bragging about too my favorites are almond and date tart lemon and yogurt mousse and the assorted cyprus pastries  cant go wrong great byob and a musttrythis place doesnt really need anymore reviews but i just had to say something if you are anywhere near district donuts go there the donuts were fluffy and delicious and came in all sorts of fun flavors the best part though was the vietnamese iced coffee  strong but sweet its some of the best iced coffee ive ever had and im kindddd of an iced coffee addict staff was friendly and the interior is super cute so happy we made the stop while in townralphs market is hands down the best deli around   their hoagies are so delicious that when i moved away i now have ralphs hoagies flown down to me in miami there is nothing else comparable in south jersey or miami for that matter   ralphs hoagies are made with delectable rolls fresh cut deli meats and cheeses and can be custom made to your liking   the service is top notch and always friendly   if you havent tried one yet you wont regret it and youll be back for morei generally love food trucks when the food is of high quality this food truck had excellent food when i visited indianapolis not only do they not use any msg or other preservatives but they had all the best americanized chinese food dishes available including fortune cookies for dessert and as i was visiting the usa it was a great opportunity to have some americanized chinese food dishes that i dont often see at home the staff member working in the truck was super friendly and the food arrived quickly after my ordering  there was a good amount of vegetables fried food and otherwise in my combo lunch and i felt great after eating it it filled me up very well and the truck didnt have too long of a line eitherooooooh i love costcooooooo thats the song i just wrote for them  catchy eh  this place is the best  high quality items samples at every turn great prices on bulk items that you need and some things you didnt know you needed until you got there  the employees are always friendly and the check out is fast  even if there are lines you wont wait long  you can tell that the employees are treated right and paid well because everyone seems to care about their job  you are a winner costcothis place is awesome  while visiting stl i had heard this place was becoming a very popular place so we decided to check it out it did not disappoint  when you walk in youre greeted by an amazing staff willing to assist in anyway possible you order at the counter and hey bring it to your table within 510 minutes the menu offers so many different options ranging from catfish to prime rib all featuring a unique style of southern comfort soul taste to them all   i ordered the fried chicken normal style i dont do heat but the spicy was recommended it was the best fried chicken ive ever had hands down it fell right off the bone i got the grilled broccoli which was amazing and the mac and cheese which was also amazing   our friends ordered the ribs catfish which was fantastic as well and prime rib all tasting so very delicious the craft beer adds a different take to the style as well all complimenting the food the atmosphere is so chill and so chic i loved it the place was absolutely fantastic i could eat here everyday   grace i salute you with a full stomach and exploding taste budsabsolutely amazing cake for my sons birthday we had a space theme party and the cake was perfect in every way pilsner beer is to die for  if thats what you like in a beer try this pilsner  15 craft beers on tap  picnic tables outside  shade trees not food but some restaurants deliver here hotdog vendor just outside some nights inside seats are hard on the bottom sidewhile driving by this lovely revamped train station in historic woodbury on my way to work during the week i have always wanted to make a visit to see what the cafe offered and what the ambiance was like when my partner and i visited on 042211 we were not disappointed   it is set in a beautifully restored train station full of charm and warmth and if i were to run a cafe i would want it to be something similar to this   the food was amazing and the ambiance was fantastic the wait staff was nice in particular our waitress christina  very efficient but not overbearing she always made certain our coffee cup was filled and engaged in conversation and was quite funny she was wonderful   the food is amazing as well  comfort foods with a french twist we had items from the breakfast menu  eggs benedict with crab  yum and a feta cheese omelet  yum it was delicious prior to the entree they served beignets a new orleans treat and although i have nothing else to compare them to we both loved them  i highly recommend this establishment for amazing food as well as an amazing atmosphere we will certainly be going back again   tim mcgiverntried this place for breakfast and it was superb the shrimp and grits was delicious and there was even enough to share the sauce is made from scratch and probably the best shrimp and grits ive had my son had the chocolate chip pancakes and he liked them so much he requested a second order the french toast and regular pancakes were also very yummy and filling the bloody marys really hit the spot great placegreat atmosphere food was delicious and well priced  the bar setting was our favorite   the bartender really cared and he gets 5 stars for customer service and keeping his guests happy  if you are in town check them out you will not be disappointedthere really isnt much bad that i can say about five guys  i love this place because i love super unhealthy really large flavorful burgers that clog my arteries like theres no tomorrow  the menu is simple burger cheeseburger double burger or cheeseburger add bacon or dont add bacon  thats about it  pick your toppings add fries or cajun fries and youre good to go    i always get the bacon double cheeseburger because lets be honest as soon as i set foot in the door the healthy aspect goes out the window so why not get the worst item for you on the menu  the cajun fries are the best and they come in huge portions  all the burgers are handmade and you get to choose as many toppings as youd like for no extra charge  definitely an a in my bookthis bakery is a hard find but they offer the best bagels around philly the bagels are soft on the inside and crisp on the outside  call them ahead of time and you can arrange catering for an meetingevent totally beats manhattan bagels and dunkin donutsworth the short walk  finely something clean a touch trendy and enjoyable near the reno strip  is go back again when im in town  the viking returns beer was delicious and much better than the regular viking although i enjoyed both  our service was good the building is really cool with a vibe thats a touch hipster  if the weather was better theyve got a nice looking out door patio with some games bags to entertain yourselfwow i was really impressed with the taste of the burgers and fries at five guys they stand head and shoulders above other fast food joints in edmonton and area   i went to in n out when i was in vegas loved it and was talking to a friend about wishing we had them here she said the closest thing was five guys and she was right  i went on a sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was busier than i expected it to be there seemed to be a little bit of organized chaos going on behind the counter but they must have their system down our food came pretty quickly  now all the burgers come with two patties as the standard so if you only want one order the little burger name i had a little bacon burger my husband had a regular sized bacon burger we and shared large cajun fries  everything came to 18 holy moly yum just delicious kind of indescribable actually which is a little funny for a fast food burger it was just so fresh and juicy and actually tasted like something rather than a slab of cardboard with ketchup on it the cajun fries were nice too although i still want to try the regular fries sometime even though i got a little burger i still couldnt finish it  i wish there was a five guys in edmonton but for now ill have to settle for hitting this one up when im in shpk sure its more expensive than regular fast food but its also way tastiergreat selection very reasonable super yummy clean as a whistlevery friendly  hard working counter girls warm greeting and always say have a  smiley daynight ive been looking forward to crime and punishment for quite some time and i have not been disappointed first and foremost all the beers i have tried are absolutely fantastic there is something for everyone novices to beer snobs alike the fact that they offer full and half sizes for all of their beers is a huge plus makes trying lots of varieties easy everything is surprisingly affordable  the space is great as well very cool to have a brewery built into a row home they also have some nice cheap bar snacks and i am looking forward to their full menu getting rolled out  its worth repeating that the beer is fantastic deliciousreally great place if like a really good home made greek meal  the staff treats you like family  the menu is amazing  the cost is fair  its like going to a greek person house and being treated like a family member  you will be opa all night as they light the cheese on fire  a must have  i recommend to everyone to come down and have a great a experience the seafood is too amazing the great part is that they have a built in pastry shop built into the restaurant and also a bar on ther other side  this place is for everyonegreat great great find the ruben was the best sandwich i have had in a while customer service was impeccable potato salad  wonderful pasta salad reminded me of a secret family recipe must trybest pizza in tucson amazing service great friendly staff and even better food everythings good absolutely everything on the menu is amazing this is my favorite restaurant in tucson by far it is always packed be prepared to wait but that wait is well worth itcame here on a whim on a saturday afternoon the wait wasnt too bad considering we wanted an outside table they have about six or seven and the food was great i ended up with a bowl of clam chowder which was amazing they had giant clam pieces and plenty of it i also ordered a shrimp ceviche with a corona great size with lots of shrimp and chips as well there is cabbage at the bottom of the bowl so dont be shocked when you first see it one star taken off because we had to ask for salt and lemons twice before anyone got it to us oh and the outdoor tables are definitely waiting for especially around the time when the sun sets we got to see sea lions and even dolphins great relaxing atmospherewhere else does the hostess walk you to your table with a basket of fresh hot rolls  cinnamon butter i have no clue but these guys do bucket of peanuts on the table along with an empty bucket for the shells reminds me of topekas   their menu shows the calories for each meal item too our server was polite and detailed when reading our orders back answered all our questions too i ordered the grilled salmon and told him to put the lemon pepper butter on the side because i hate lemon pepper with a passion mike ordered the beef tips with rice  gravy on the side my salmon was grilled perfectly with a nice crisp to the top and was so moist inside i asked for a side of bbq sauce so i could dip my salmon in that instead it came with two sides so i got the steak fries  steamed veggies our server informed me the veggies also came with the lemon pepper sauce and asked if i wanted them without so my veggies were steamed plain which worked for me the entire meal was amazing im terrible at cooking fish and have made myself sick the last time i cooked salmon so i said id rather have the pros do it for me  my husband was given two sides of gravy with his beef tips so he slide the other to me to dip my steak fries in and its so much better tasting than ketchup try it and tell me the only thing that wasnt tended to was refilling of our tea and water another server asked us if we wanted more to drink after our check was delivered she brought out a to go box and put drinks in to go cups for us too other than that great experiencewow   what an awesome cuban i was googling places by my work and thought id give it a try 10 stars  everything was so fresh  cant wait to come back and try the other cubansgreat location excellent breweryrestaurant awesome service and beer selection only criticism i could give is the menu selection is lacking on the sandwichlunch fare awesome outdoor patio area as well  good for families as wellbest pizza ever tasted its different from any other pizza you could go buy  made with all the freshest ingredients they offer many options on the menu to make it a tough decision  the workers are pleasant and friendly worth your time to go try you wont be disappointedamazing food this was purchased for myself and my coworkers for lunch recently and i had never heard of them but i really enjoyed it i had the tango salad and it came with a baguette that no one ate because they were pretty hard and a cookie but still the food was awesomewe tried lamb kabobs and chicken vindaloo tonight and were very happy with both we love hole in the wall places this one fits the bill too its primarily take out inside a convenience store the proprietor told us about the lunch special which offers a variety of food so you can find your favorite we are going back for fresh chili chicken tomorrow i suggest if you like it spicy ask for it the food was delicious and flavorful but not spicy enough for our palatesthis was by far the best experience ive ever had at a restaurant the facility was near spotless the food was amazing and the staff was friendly i had some fried ravioli and some buffalo wings the root beer is extremely sweet which makes it even better   the fried ravioli was cooked precisely evenly coated with batter all around the breaded ravioli was fresh and delivered as soon as it was fresh off of the deep frier the buffalo wings were perfectly and evenly seasoned with sauce the celery that came with the wings were crisp and cool i wish i lived in tampa so i could come here all of the time i recommend a location in virginiabest donut of my entire life and most of st louis a donut town mind you agrees with meoh my  every time i come to nola i discover a new must have    buttermilk drops  not only a friendly staff but very generous as well  tastee is just another reason why i love nola   the people and the foodholy crap square donuts kick ass  after seeing they were opening downtown a while ago then stalking from afar for a few weeks stupid health goals i finally finally let myself venture in and i was not disappointed  i purchased 1 square yeast scrumptious 1 square cinnamon divine and 1 square jelly filled and peanut butter iced  life changing  these donuts are not just good theyre exceptional  the 2 fellas working there this morning were also super friendly  1 got my mix of donut goodness and the other grabbed my jamaiican me crazy coffee also really tasty even for a noncoffee drinker  in and out in just a few minutes and didnt break the bankjust my diet  do what i did  work

my husbands eggs were good also   coffee delicious  service very good  get there before 7 or be prepared to wait in line  hope i get to return some daycoming from the northwest ive yet to find a replacement coffee shop for my faves back home until now coffee lunch is amazing stopped in for the first time to grab coffee and a breakfast biscuit  phenomenal best biscuits ive had since i moved to the south since my first visit ive been trying to make it back during business hours without luck until today stopped in for the breakfast biscuit but just missed the breakfasts over memo and was referred to the steak sandwich by the folks behind the counter  they were so acommodating of my starving fluster  i settled for the steak sandwich and im so glad i did because its one the best steak sandwich ive ever had ill be making regular visits to this nashville gem of a coffee lunch spot   so good go   biscuits are awesome coffee is awesome and people that work there  even awesomerthese cakes are going to be the death of me theyre delicious  try the white chocolate raspberry the red velvet or the pb chocolate cute retail details and always a sample of their featured flavor  first found this place down south while i was pregnant glad we didnt get one in goleta until i was safely beyond my pregnancy cravings whenever we drive by my 2 year old says um i think we need a bundt momfunniest thing tucson is so dead to memost of the time then to drive by el nenes on a friday night i swore there was a block party going down but no its just how busy they are at fort lowell and wetmore i love my sonoran dogs  of all kinds be it bk or guerro after all why does a girl need to be so selective if its all gooooddd but i will tell ya nene hits the spot each and every time especially the with the cheesed griddled right on to the bun if you havent had buns like that you need it of course ive had their entire menu and everything is delish  second most often ordered by me is the carmelo enough though  you just need to check out the jointi really enjoy this mexican restaurant because its close to the house and we always have great service the cheese sauce is good and the margaritas are tasty this is the 1st place i have ever had tortilla chicken soup it is really good chicken broth with chicken rice pico and fresh avocados on top its a huge bowl  their tacos are great tooour new favorite restaurant great pulled pork sandwich love their bbq cobb salad too cornbread  sauces are delicious do yourself a favor and try this place nowwe were in indianapolis on a business trip for the week and found this place in yelp best place in indianapolis we have strict dietary restrictions due to health reasons crohns so finding a place to eat out is always a bit of a challenge this was the first place where we took nearly 20 min to decide what we wanted to eat so many options for us and the food was incredible the paleo pizza crust made us not even miss regular pizza crust and the kombucha cocktails were so refreshing plus the service was top notch definitely coming back here when we are here for business againthe poutine and the depot burger are amazing here definitely a winner that will satiate most foodies additionally the staff and ambience of this venue is awesome not to mention they cater fine brews and an outdoor area with cornhole boards i give this establishment an a and i will most definitely return when i have gigs in the reno nv areadelicious  soooo creamy  they also let you taste test everything  i got the cafe au lait and chocolate chickorysomething  so good  my friend also got the goat cheese and fig as well as the chocolate amaretto cheesecake flavors  both of those are delicious as well  after a while i felt like i was going to get a heart attack from all the cream  but it would have been worth it    staff is friendly and patient  cash only againi always bring my friends here when theyre visiting from out of town they always love it even if theyre not into burgers gotta say this place never ceases to please their whole look and feel and belief system is awesome   theyre big on recycling so all their locations are made up of old torn down barn parts including the tin ceiling tiles the chairs tables most of the decorations etc i love their take out menu its pocketsized and really cute with a great selection of items that are all made to order its a little harder to follow that their dinein menu but even their dinein menu can be a bit overwhelming to follow my favorite topping is the chickpea onions its just shoestring onions dipped in a chickpea batter and fried to a crisp goes great on any burger the appetizers are really pricey and are only really worth it if theres a bunch of people eating good for groups the pickle and slaw appetizer is a good one to share the sweet potato fries and other side items are just enough  my favorite server there is heaven who always knows just what to recommend and is very charming in her presence my friends love having her wait on us she is always smiling and keeping things upbeat the bar staff are a great group too they are always willing to mix drinks up together for you i always mix the iced teas together which are all really good with a little agave    seriously loving the philly location wish they stood out more its dark from the outside and pretty easy to miss even with the marquee sign outside the space is great love the booth seating and the bear theme   bare burger is pricey but so worth it the ingredients are always fresh and the menu has something for everyone lots of customization in their burgers make it even more enjoyable definitely give it a shot if youre feeling down and want to treat yo self roundabout did an amazing job catering our wedding they offered so much more than your basic choice of chicken or fish we had an amazing selection of the unique mediterranean style salad bar to beef or lamb sandwiches and topped off by a mix your own mac  cheese bar everything tastes wonderful and the staff was professional they would be a great choice for any of your catering needscame here for the first time on new years eve for a burlesque show and really enjoyed both the show and the venue  drink prices were reasonable and the space was very coolsuper great sandwiches  very laid back atmosphere  folks who work here are extremely pleasant  a great place to stop in for a casual bitereally great quality food we had a baby at renown and for 3 nights in a row i ordered a different entree from this place chicken with mixed vegetables pho mongolian beef a kung pao beef all were really high quality and tasty no tendon in the meet no fat just great food one of my fav restaurants nowthis was the perfect spot for me and my girls to have our last meal before heading back home from our minigetaway  sooo glad we picked this place  santa barbara is known for their super fresh seafood so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot at the end of the pier  we came at around 1130am which was perfect because we beat the big lunch rush  we were seated within 15 minutes so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited  youre also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you dont feel like waiting   we were seated outside so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier  it was beautiful    the four of us shared a pitcher of hefenweizen which paired deliciously with all of the food to come  light refreshing and the view was a big plus  and the whole pitcher was only 18  we started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the morrow bay oysters and kusshi oysters  the morrow bays were bigger than the kusshi so i expected a saltier less sweet taste  it was actually just as sweet and the smaller kusshi oysters  i was pleasantly surprised and these were both very fresh    for my main course i ordered the half maine lobster which also came with onion rings and a soup i went with the lobster bisque  the half maine lobster was super fresh and tender  the tail was a little chewy but better than a lot of lobsters ive had lately  my favorite part was the super meaty claw  it came out of the shell beautifully with ease and melted like butter in my mouth  i didnt even need the side of melted butter  this dish was simple and sweet  the lobster bisque was good but nothing id be craving  i hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it but i think they just used lobster for the flavor  oh  the onion rings here are amazing  light crisp and flakey  my friends ordered the lobster roll and the rock crab claws the rounder shaped claws with the black tips  the lobster roll looked amazing and it wasnt super drenched in mayo either  i noticed that my friend didnt eat the roll it looked pretty basicgrocery store bought  it would be nice if they used a buttery toasted baguette as ive seen in other restaurants  the rock crab claws were fresh and meaty i must order this one next time    overall we loved the food and ambiance here a perfect ending to our trip i had really amazing meat pie made with puff pastry also some delicious boudin balls the restaurant had a really great a atmosphere and its super close to my job  go here and try everything  grilled cheese is also baller try it with the shoestring friesexcellent food ask for the home made chipotle sauce the fried plantains and black bean soup were delicious i especially enjoyed the  pan con bistec we will certainly be backi just moved to tucson and found lota burger on speedway  the best customer service was given  amber was so extremely helpful and very professionaldelicious food chicken  toast  sweet savory and a little spicy yumm  the steak and egg sandwich was also delicious great service and wait time was correctly quoted i had a great experience here the ladies were extremely friendly the gelato was outstanding i had plain vanilla but it was so delicious the red velvet cake was also wonderful highly recommendeddelicious and worth the wait i got the sweet potato pancakes my husband the pecan pancakes and we shared hash browns  bacon  it was all fantastic   yes the line is long but its in a cute neighborhood so you can enjoy the surroundings while you wait and once seated we didnt feel rushed nor did it seem hecticbest gelato ive ever had and im the biggest gelatofroyoice cream snob seriously the best consistency and flavorsthis was by far one of the best meals ive had in a while everything was perfect we started with the eggplant bruschetta escargot and the veal meatballs for our meals we had a pizza squash ravioli a rolled beef cant remember the name and a stuffed meat pasta cant remember the name eairher everything was outstanding next time were saving room for dessertwe got there past 5pm on a saturday night and the wait list is not long maybe like 4 people ahead of us on the list you get to choose to be seated inside or out we chose both 20 mins later we noticed the list filled up fast the wait is longer if you want to be seated outside the food is great only one unisex restroom available insidethe ice cream was great but i was mainly impressed with the service lonnie love was upbeat positive extremely professional and went out of his way to give us a nice experience had to write this review so his bosses could know he did greatgreat place to brunch the food is so damn delicious and the biggest perk for us is parking there is indoor and outdoor spaces available but we always do the outside in the summer the  view from the patio in the back is great bc you overlook kelly drive and the rivermy new favorite ice cream spot the mexican twinky is amazing this will not be my last visit they have water based as well as cream based  so if you want a guiltless treat as my husband did you can go with one of their fruit sorbets  our little girl got the strawberry cream and it was really good also much better than your average strawberry ice cream staff was super friendly and the store was very clean and bright  great spotstill new to the area but found this place and it reminds me a bit of home im from seattle the food is delicious and you can taste how real it is as compared to something like panera so far ive had the grilled cheese with tomato soup and the southwestern style chicken salad and a chocolate croissant would recommend them to anyone quiet and out of the way im planning on this being my new study spotepic some of the most amazing ice cream i have ever eaten they give you free taste testing of every ice cream they have available for purchase on miniature spoonfuls you almost feel bad after trying so many to find the exact one you wantamazing this was my second visit to st louis for thanksgiving but my first time here i got the pumpkin pie frozen custard and i was expecting just the pumpkin flavor after a few bites i found actual chunks of crust mad good it was a little out of the way from clayton but definitely worth it my only regret was that i was sharing with my husband and i should have gotten the largest size possiblethe fountain is a wonderful place for lunch cocktails ice cream sundae or all three  decorated like an old fashioned artdeco upscale old school ice cream parlor making the most of an old auto dealership the food and drink are amazing  i had the highhat egg salad sandwich with brussels kale cup and a midtown mojito and topped it all off with the black cadillac ice cream sundae which is black cherry ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream served in an oldfashioned tulip sundae glasslove this place  the ironic thing is that this restaurant is in the meadowood mall food court and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the reno area  the first time we tried it we loved it so much we went back 2 days later  we have been back a few more times since the shrimp scampi is absolutely delicious and the fish tacos are the best my husband has ever had  cant wait to try their fish and chips which seems to be their signature dish  around the holiday season they were even selling their wild caught alaskan cod frozen by the pound to take home i dont know if they do that year round  it was 795 per pound which is a great price  love the place and we will be backgreat food great customer service small little authentic taco joint with all the fixings so many choices to choose from and you cant go wrong with any choice you make i think ive had about everything they have to offer i love the elotes cup and the sopes you must come here oh everything is made freshonce upon a time in the dusty town in the badlands of tucson there was a taco truck on the corner of wetmore and a wet canadian they had a hotdog that had been hand made by angels from heaven that sing songs of magical enchantment until the drones of other sonoran dogs are just considered devil songs the food here is just like waking up from a long awaited nap after the heat of battle no more local hot dog chains made famous from a lackluster food networkjust locals bringing the heat on from a truck made from dreams   in this dream i will make this simplei work very close to this place i have been here many times over the last few years so they are consistent in their quality there are other place in town that people think are the best for the famous sonoran hot dog this place is king of the sonoran dog no one can touch themkings  like mama said knock you out kings asada tacos carmelos condimentsall of it is legit come heredont mind the dusty parking lotthis is tucson you are allowed to have a concealed carry and the right to super dank mexican foodawesome atmosphere and even better pizza  owner served us and was a gentleman checked in on us regularly and made sure we were well taken care of would highly recommend to anyone in the areahow cute and quaint is this place not to mention they had the sweetest staff we came here with our baby in a stroller and they went over and above to open the door for us and to make us feel welcomed and to help us the little stairs they have the bomb coffee its an allaround yesskip the cronut had it and its fine but the real strength of swiss haus is that it is a good bakery in center city it seems the trend around cc has been specialization  cupcake shops galore frenchitalian pastries etc all  having their place but sometimes you just want to have a real bakery as a bakery is intended  cakes cookies pies swiss haus has all of these and more and they do them well their cookies are great especially if you need a last minute snack for the office  who doesnt love a box of cookies sitting on the conference table everybody working there is very friendly and helpful too and the place is clean and the display cases look great  i highly recommend swiss haus if you want to get back to basicsajs has some of the best brick oven fired pizza in tucson ive tried virtually ever pizza place in this city and i can tell you ajs is in the top 3 places they use a mozzarella cheese by a company called grande that is a true cheese to the name mozzarella very chewy and slightly oily but accentuates the rest of the pizza superbly the 16 pie is only 1300 which i felt was more than reasonable for the amount of toppings and cheese that is put on iti didnt know this place was just beside of the drug store small bakery but nice atmosphere with great worker breads are look so fresh and goodi went in for a quick donut run around 5pm the donuts were still very fresh and not stale there were many unique donuts to choose from so i went with an almond joy vietnamese coffee chocolate sprinkle and cookies and cream all were fantastic id be back if i lived in the area cool little place that has amazing cookie dough it tastes just like real cookie dough but is made without eggs or dairy chocolate chips technically are handled with dairy theyll let you try whatever you want so have at it until you find what you like 1 scoop is more than enough you can get it in a cone or a cup just like ice cream it stays if you need to take it home for later or the next day love it staff is super welcoming and will tell you all about the flavors and process if you have questionsi just tried this place for the first andthe cupcakes and banana pudding are insanely good   the staff are friendly and so nice  please please dont every move out of the city stay right where you are     definitely back again and again and again and again and againwell u get the ideagreat location great beer selection you have many choices of beer on tap plus they have plenty of to go choices no food here but they usually have food trucks nearby enjoy a stroll on the green belt and stop byi grabbed breakfast with a friend early one saturday morning and henrys was such a delightful little nook we were greeted warmly and had a nice long chat with the barista the food was exceptional and was just the right amount of food not too much or too little this place is where you want to be on a slow weekend morningim bummed i didnt review about this bakery right away i cant remember the exact cake i got but it was amazing it was some chocolate strawberry concoction with cheesecake in the middle we left it out on the table for about an hour and yet when we finally got to the cake the cheesecake part was still chilled enough to not be mushy it was absolutely scrumptious ill definitely be back to get more in the futurethis is a cool little place there is a small gift shop with pieces made by local artists they accept donations for those in need and the decor is fun and friendly there are gluten free options as well i had the raspberry hot chocolate with a banging oatmeal raisin cookie there is a small area for children to sit and playcolor this is definitely a family friendly place we usually do lunch somewhere else in town but now that we have found this gem this will be our new desert spothad heard fantastic things about bff and could not wait to try it needless to say it completely exceeded my expectations   im by no means a picky eater but convenience is unfortunately the primary factor of most of my eating decisions and bff makes is easy to eat very healthy very conveniently   i got four meals two steak and two chicken fuel packs and they have all been fantastic so far   chelsea behind the counter was very helpful and informed me you get a free sauce with the purchase of a fuel pack the meals also come in reusable food storage containers which is also a nice touch  they will be seeing a ton of me in the futureyum yum yum so many flavors to choose from the best frozen custard in town  dont be discouraged by the long lines the people who work there are so efficient that the line goes really fast  the only worry i have is that both entrances to the parking lot are right by the stand which makes it pretty dangerous for people who are standing around eating their treats if the entrances are by the far end of the lots thatll be better we always park on the street insteadthanks to erin m i am addicted to their burritos at 5 its hard to find a better deal around ahem chipotle ahem and their burritos are flavorful and filling i can make one last for 2 meals if im not starving i usually order the tofu verde since i enjoy the level of spice in the saucemy family and i came to visit reno for a weekend and we came here two days in a row because it was just that good the first night we came in looking for some good boba and a crispy chicken snack and boy did we find something much more this place does it all with their taiwanese snacks my dad told me it reminded him of actual taiwan because everything was so authentic   we ordered the crispy chicken snack the clam soup and some green bean smoothies and it was just amazing  the following day we came back for the braised pork and egg rice the beef noodle soup the green onion pancake salt and pepper chicken wings and some more green bean smoothies definitely didnt disappoint the second time around either love this plays  the owners and the variety of wine  great atmosphere and ohhhh those red wine brownies from the farmers daughter yum  its nice to find a great place with music on a sunday that has you enter as customers and leave as friends  absolutely cant wait to go backwhose ever momma they have chiefing in the back i want to hug herlol i was skeptical at first due to google reviews vs yelp reviews and uber eats rating however i was pleased that the ribs were very tender and flavorful mac and cheese wasnt the kraft with the watery cheese if any another winner and the yams taste like love was in em im glad i took the chance i know you cant please everybody and some people are just unbelievable with their expectations the customer isnt always right sometimes they have bad taste buds i will definitely be ordering from them againbig respect for baileys range for keeping the beer selection local as a craft beer hunter i am usually happy to find 1 beer on a menu that i have never heard of today my mind was blown as a traveler looking at this tap lineup i have seriously only seen 3 of the 30 beers they have on tap i wish i could spend a few days working my way through them if you love beer and your traveling through st louis you need to come here the food is great tooim writing this review based on the young lady who helped me taylor i used the wrong name in my check in at any rate she had the most pleasant positive attitude for 845 pm initially she was cleaning up and when she noticed me she immediately stopped what she was doing to help me she noticed we had the same bank card and we started chatting about that i learned that this was her 1st job and a lot of the lessons and take always  she learned while working in food service i was impressed as i have a 17 year old and i know how challenging working with the public and food can be she did a phenomenal job engaging me with a smile and great attitude based on her interaction i would come back to this panera  sorry i cant speak for the food i actually was getting a to go order for me daughter and tasted nothing check them outgreat atmosphere in the store great flowers wonderful produce all kinds of specialties the only weak spot is the prepared foods although the sushi is fineamazing food great staff its a great environment for a great price i highly reccomend everything on the menu we had amazing red beans and rice as well as the gumbo the mac and cheese was tasty and so was the gator on a stick which is in sausage formatvery nice lady working here  very helpful to two outoftowners looking for special mementosgreat great breakfast start to finish candied pecan smoked bacon sweet cream pancakes and fleur die lis omeletwas introduced to range sometime ago after a drunken night on a quest for food range is local down to the beers 30 taps of local brews from the likes of schlafly 4 hands perennial 2nd shift and civil life start with a local beer just do it heck have a few theyre all great no beer for you you say fine have an adult milkshake like the bacon shake or horchata shake the bacon shake is life changing and quite possibly better than some of the sex ive had and yes that quote is from a friend of mine ok so onward to food the burgers here are not your typical bar burgers if you want something off the norm then youve come to the right place try any of em ive yet to be disappointed by any of em order the fries with the spicy ketchup or order the giant grease bomb onion rings so youve had a different burger now finish it off with some home made ice cream the salted caramel ice cream is superb for beer floats staff is always super friendly here it does tend to get busy around peak hours and on the weekends so plan accordinglyhow can you not like ted drewesi live about a mile away and try not to overindulge i try to stick with the basic scoop in a cupi just like the ice cream sometimes i get a root beer float if im thirstly definately the best ice cream anywhereits a mandatory stop besides the klller product im deeming it as excellent customer service i called canulis months back in my first attempt to understand how the korean bbq meat bulgogi was created i was extremely lucky to talk to jerry who told me what meat to use and what would be cost efficient he sliced down a roast for me wrapped it separate and gave it a little citrus spray i took it home to make the bulgogi ive used it for cheesesteaks and pepper steaks also its unreal the fact that they will slice it for you is a gift but mainly i understand its labor and he volunteered it which simplifies to excellent customer service i have incorporated the house of pork into my freezer stocking ventures with that being said its time i also recommend what most people know or if they dont they need to they are famous for the sausage its hands down the clean up hitter in the lineup on an allstar block of great italian foods i was first introduced to their hot sausage at a dinner party and my friend advised me of the location which ultimately set the wheels in motion its amazing what also is amazing is the breakfast sausage the real deal its absolutely unreal and ill go one step further to state that i am not really a sausage fanatic i highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to make their sauce or gravy turn heads or their in laws happy morning guests 1010brunch was delicious  breakfast foods were all top notch and the prime rib was excellent  70 for three people and worth every pennygreat concept and great food the service is amazing as well every staff member we came into contact with was a complete joy my boyfriend and i follow the keto diet and this place has lots of tantalizing options make sure to try the guacamole with bacon chips the bacon just melts in your mouth the angry shrimp is equally delicious i could eat those cauliflower grits every single day they are so creamy and ketopaleo approved the ambiance is cozy and inviting as well perfect for date night or a quick bitethis place is a little slice of heaven fresh and homemade cheeses pasta pastries sandwiches as well as a ton of homemade food to take home huge wine selection i cant say enough good things about mazzaros i go at least once a week the first time you go can be a little overwhelming because it is usually very busy just ask someone who looks like they know what they are doing and they will lead you where you need to goi was looking for somewhere to go for lunch on a healthconscious flavorful sort of tip and i most assuredly found it this is one of the now two vietnamese restaurants ive crossed in new orleans with this particular style of lemongrass chicken the other being in gretna to which i kinda hate to traverse and i thoroughly appreciated it had it with rice and i enjoyed two fairly interesting drinks with it though i can only currently recall the names of them while looking at the menu my fault bad shortterm memory back in taskthe plate had enough food on it to eat twice if you eat moderate meals and the prices are extremely modest especially considering the area and the style of foodfrankly there are far less flavorful options for steeper fare so the fact that it was happy hour was only the cherry on top only spent about 27 before tip had a bit of conversation since it was a little slower and i thoroughly enjoyed myself in every way i smiled from the time i entered and was immediately greeted to the time i left and got into the car where i checked in and began writing this review in my time there i didnt get to try the muchlauded whiskey sunrise about which most of the visiting yelpers have previously raved but the other two cocktails i purchased were enjoyable and its more than safe to say i will definitely be back with company to try it outwings are amazingly flavorful i love their beer selection as well i would say the only negative is how small their menu is theres little to chose from and you cant always get the same thing depending what day you go or what they have on the menu that day but owner is very friendly and helpfullove the brewery great atmosphere fantastic beer a little on the pricey side but worth it really wish they had more options when filling the growlers but i still give 4 hands 5 stars because their beer deserves it cheersfantastic food great environment to just shop enjoy a gelato or sit down for some authentic italian they have ready made pasta and pesto theres a different option for each day of the year love love love this place wish you would be open on sundayi love this place reminds me of the cafe that used to be everywhere throughout reno before a certain seattle coffee store popped up on every street corner lol the price of everything is genorous considering the quality of the drinksfood available perfect spot to relax and meet up with friendsbest coffee in town  in  broadripple across from monkeys tale friendly serversa bit tough to find and only open seasonally but oinks is one of the my favorite bbq places  a friend of mine will drive from an hour away to pick up some baby backs and chicken  the chicken is some of the best that you will have  also a big fan of the baby backs they are usually excellent but they dont always have them  i saw some comments about the regular ribs not being fall of the bone and ive had the same experience but typically if you want fall off the bone then you should be going with baby backs  id also recommend the brisket over the pulled pork hands down  corn muffins are good also  cant beat the roadside ambience of a bbq truck and this one hits it homeas a philadelphia local and native some friends thought this would be a fun excursion on a sunday afternoon they were right spending over 25 hours walking through chinatown asiatown and eating our way through was an excellent time the tour is free and eating at each of the 6 stops barely broke the 10 mark   jennifer was an excellent guide providing great insight into the history of philadelphia chinatown and its surroundings as well as great advice on what to order at each of the locations   id recommend this tour for locals looking for a fun and adventurous weekend or for any out of towners looking for something off the beaten pathprobably the best burger joint in santa barbara areathis little place will not disappoint hubs had a ceasar salad with blackened chicken i had firehouse grilled cheese just yum on grilled sourdough bread fried mac n cheese bites are to die for reasonable prices good service and get thisthey deliver menu includes many varieties of grilled cheese quesadillas mac n cheese bowls nice kids menu too definitely going backsurprised i havent posted a review for twisted iron before  ive tried them a number of times since they arrived on the road from their waffle fries to their chicken and waffles  twisted iron has always whipped out some tasty food truck eats that are both unique and delicious i was really happy to see them out and about after tampa luv chickens unfortunate ending  although im not originally from tampa i would say my taste for fried chicken and waffles is probably the most southern thing about me and twisted iron delivers the owners are young and friendly  clearly passionate about their food prices average 610 which is standard for food truck food  the actual food truck itself is modern with a clean wrap and mostly visible interior im not much of a dessert guy  but i do like waffle dessert choices that are offered by twisted iron  shoutout to anna m for sharing some of her pulled pork waffle fries with me today at the food court  they were delicious and hit the spot i hope to see twisted iron around soon with some new creationsa great place for cheap ripe produce because its ripe its better to buy as you need rather than in advance for a week love this placeso delicious top notch food service and its super cute inside the owner brad is really friendly helpful with the menu and just overall welcoming and makes you feel like a longtime friendall their locations are pretty good authentic food with lots of choices and great portions love their babaganoush chicken shawarma hummus tabouli like the south tampa location has an outdoor patio area  a room for bigger partiesexcellent inexpensive takeout banhmi from a very unassuming deli counter at the back of this midcity corner store definitely have them add homemade pat for 5075 havent tried their other dishes but definitely will next timenutella croissant white sangrias its honestly what stood out the most to me excellent serviceits an awesome place for a vegetarian person staff is friendly and food quality is also good must gothis aldis is always clean friendly and shelves stocked the parking lot has plenty of parking the staff is good at opening additional lanes to keep the wait of the lines down always a good shopping experiencei am always searching for the perfect cheesesteak after having lived on the east coast home of awesome cheesesteaks and steak bombs  i think i have finally found a place in tucson for great cheesesteaks and that is herejamba jamba ive always loved jamba juice in fact when i moved to the midwest i was deeply saddened by the fact that there wasnt any around where i lived i would have seriously driven half an hour or more to go to one if there was one when i first moved here  enough about my gripes so there is one thats only about 9 minutes from where i live and its connected to a schnucks you could do some grocery shopping and finish it up with a refreshing healthy smoothie i personally love their protein berry workout smoothie  a blend of soy milk strawberries bananas and a choice of either soy or whey protein boost its pretty much a meal replacement especially if you dont have time to stop and have a hearty breakfast if you would like a healthier breakfast though they have some deliciouslooking energy bowls i might try one on my days off  i have also had their chocolate mood smoothie and it was pretty good but that was a long time ago i used to drive an hour to go to the other side of the island to the jamba juice location honestly a 9minute drive is nothing i am a happy person and i will definitely be back maybe more often than i would like toi love shopping for wine beer and liquor here huge selection i host a wine night with friends and we can always find the random wines we need here staff is always knowledgeable and carries the cases to my car top notch servicethis place is great the bartenders are wonderful and the oyster bar delivers great company the atmosphere is easy and not pretentious as other restaurants of this caliber can be thanks for a great dinner drinks and companyi love la colombe  not all branches have the same interior the rittenhouse branch is really cozy  with beautiful tables that match the cups and saucers used   the iced almond mocha was good not too chocolatey but not too bitter either it was just right   and the croissant was really good too ive never tasted bad almond croissant but i guess i could say this is one of the best   definitely going to their fishtown branch to get a hold of that draft lattemy friends and i always love coming here they have an array of flavors and they are all unique my favorites are the lavender earl grey and champagne sorbet the prices are also very fair  however this place is cash only so just keep that in mind i definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting some ice cream or just craving sweetsyummy yummy yummy this place is by far one of the best sushi restaurants ive ever been to and i have been eating sushi since i was a little girl each meal was flavorful and delicious from the miso soup to the two rolls my sister and i shared great service danelo great food and fast cooking so thankful we decided to try this place out will be backthe freezer packs are not only a great deal  they are always super fresh and ready to pop in the ice chest once you get home the meats taste great and are priced usually better than a supermarket kevin talks very fast  but he definitely knows what he is talking about they have a decent deli selection too with boars head meats and cheeses i dont personally care for their homemade sausages chicken or pork because they are a little too lean for my preference the bacon is the best youll find around and is cured without sugaryes pricey but convenient and its a small family owned store not a huge selection but past friendly clean cute and convenientgreat place  i have allergies so i love a place that cooks to order and we willingly makes adjustmentsmy god why isnt there a line running outside the door to get into this place  the food and sides are soooo good  i love catfish and harolds fried catfish is without a doubt right up there with the best catfish ive ever ate anywhere in the us including the deep south  the mac and cheese is simply delicious  silky smooth with oven browned cheese goodness mixed in just like a good mac and cheese should be  i only wish i could have got some collared greens as a side but they were out of them and the green beans were seasoned great so i wasnt completely left out in the cold  im certainly going to work my way through the rest of the side dishes in upcoming visits  good honest scratch cooking done rightwow excellent service and the best calamari i have ever had the beer was good and atmosphere friendly nothing negative about this place at allsocal burger  so darn good  so good that ive eaten at bareburger on at least 5 occasions but always order the same darn thing avocado pickled onions and i always add a little jalapeo for some extra heat   i also love that they deliver  as such bareburger has been my default lunch option for rainy days when im in no mood to leave the officethe best italian market outside of nyc  we are so lucky to have this store in st petersburg everything they have is fantastic the bakery deli pasta butcher etc the besti have celiacs disease and was diagnosed at 19 years old i have been eating gluten free for 13 years and there are times when i sadly miss the delicious sweet treats you get at a bakery since becoming gluten free i have been in search of sweets that taste like the real thing if not better than the real thing  the happy mixer has nailed it i have been given their cupcakes as gifts and i cant even share them with others because they are that good i am also addicted to their brownies and oatmeal raisin cookies which i get at jules thin crust in doylestown and i am in love   the cost of their high quality goods is more affordable than anything i have found in a grocery store or another bakery that is not strictly gluten free  this place offers fresh and beautiful items and you can tell that they really care about the food they are providing and love what they do   i appreciate this place and hope that everyone even those without a gluten allergy give this place a chance because this is better than the real thing  keep up the amazing workthe manager zack has really cleaned up this place the service is much better like it was shortly after it opened check it outgreat burger spot my first order was their sunny side up burger with an egg and applewood bacon i was hooked from that point i have tried most of their menu of burgers and made a few of my own its is a lot of fun to go their after a night of partying and challenge your friends to an oldfashion game of burger builderoh yes go immediately to this place buy a filet of snapper and experience what it is like to eat truly fresh fish   i cannot explain to you what it is like to eat a truly fresh piece of fish it does not smell fishy it does not taste fishy it is not rubbery it is not dry   it just tastes like deliciously sweet flakes of heaven  red snapper go get some while its in seasonlove this new italian market restaurant the waiters were as nice and helpful as can be the food was phenomenal  do not miss the short rib pasta we had probably 6 or 7 dishes plus dessert and the only thing that wasnt basically perfect was the duck with cauliflower rice  the cauliflower rice was quite salty but other than that overall flavor of it was also great i would order everything we got again including the delicious desserts and cant wait to try the rest of the menuif you like pancakes and efficient no frill service this place is for you if the line is reasonable you can get in and out and well fed within 30mins blueberry pancakes are the bestvisited new orleans for the end of mardi gras and stumbled upon this little cafe for breakfast ended up coming back the next two days because the food is absolutely incredible they serve breakfast and lunch and between everyone we tried a decent portion of their menu the boudin omelette is amazing along with the bourbon street breakfast which comes with a shot of bourbon the entire staff is great especially our server joe the whole place just makes you feel like youre eating a great meal at a friends house i would recommend this place to anyone visiting nola whos looking for a delicious and affordable meal i will for sure make this place a required stop on all future visitschipotle is the targt of the mexican fast food game   whats not to love about chipotle  burritos or tacos bowls made your way quick hot fresh generally great service at this cherry hill location  they also have a really good soundtrack playing whenever i go in   my go to is the carnitas burrito but you cant really go wrong with anything  good rice fresh salsa and guacamole    and yes we are aware the guacamole is extra   as for the price its a bit more expensive than your normal fast food joint but then again the quality and freshness is a step upthis place is so delicious get the frozen lemonade the service is great and its a wonderful stop to cool down after walking down the french quarterwe decided to go were the locals eat we went on a saturday morning at 8am good thing new orleans doesnt seem to wake up until after 10 on weekends there was no wait the food was so good  i highly recommend the cinnamon bun freaking blew my taste buds up the nutella banana cream was delicious as wellwe stopped in while exploring tarpon springs for the first time we were seated immediately even though the restaurant was bustling our server soula was very personable and gave us her genuine opinion when we asked i ordered the greek style scallops and they were very good my friend ordered the combination plate which was really good if you have not had greek food and want to try multiple thingsive only had the beer but holy moly their beer is perfect their growlers are great deals and the environment is ideal for dates groups and even families   we drive about an hour to come here and plan to come back regularlyexcellent food try the pipeline philly steak sandwich  it may be one of the best philly steak sandwiches i have enjoyed in the tampa bay area also their sliders are incredible the wrapping is also very nice on this food truck  but its not just a pretty truck  the food is also delicious   give them a shotcant get enough of this place the coffee the donuts the cheeseburger slider the service all amazingfantastic walked in for dinner around 8 it was very busy but they we able to seat us by the kitchen a great spot the wait staff was amazing especially bobby who was very friendly knowledgeable and personable and not even our waiter   we started off with bureki and fried calamari the bureki was baked perfectly it could have been a bit more puffed but still had a great flavor the calamari was really surprising for me i never eat calamari when its ordered its always so rubbery chewy and greasy this was none of those things light crispy calamari that was so tender they also brought us complementary bread and tahini and red wine yum for our entrees we got the stuffed pepper and the cyprus tortelloni the tortelloni was had a great texture and a yogurt based sauce that paired with it quite well the stuffed pepper was cooked perfectly the filling was delicious and came with a dollop of lebany which i love with stuffed peppers   the chef came out a few times and picked out desserts for the two of us as we were game and we were not disappointed we received the galatoboureko and the pistachio and olive oil cake both were so good i love pistachio desserts  nice friendly atmosphere very clean look the price for what we got was right on the nose dinner and a show as my boyfriend said as there was plenty to look at conversations to overhear all of the ingredients we top quality and used with the utmost care i also heard amazing things about the quail if i wasnt leaving tomorrow id go again for dinner or breakfast which also looks amazinghonestly i have been to over half the breweries in the tampa st pete area and this is by far one of my favorites some breweries just make beer but angry chair makes amazing beer some i recommend is their german chocolate cupcake stout the awakening and any barley wine or ipa i keep going back to get more in a growler wishing i can get a keg but they keep refusing i hope i can sweet talk them in to giving me a keg of the cupcake stout but until then i will keep getting growler fills must must visit   careful parking is limited dont park on fern you will understand when you visitamazing breakfast love bringing visiting family and friends from out of town here such a great variety of foodi came in and although parking was small it was easy to find a space i walked into a modern cozy little shop with high ceilings i asked the very sweet and adorable barista what was popular and told her it was my first time in i was recommended and received a delicious peppermint holiday drink with a little almond milk and peppermint pieces on the whipped cream  i didnt catch the drinks name i also got a really moist and delicious slice of lemon pound cake i highly recommend this place and asking the baristas whats goodcame in today for the first time i got the whiskey ginger donut and the oyster slider everything was delicious probably the only thing i could say otherwise is that i wish the donut had more ginger on it but again not a big dealsuper fast delivery we order at least once a week and it takes 15 minutes i like that you can get any sandwich as an unwich love the pickles and that they quarter themalways good food hot quick and delicious the best wendys ive ever eaten at the counter service is confusing at times because there are too many people in a very small area but they usually are spot on and do very well   there are other wendys locations closer to me where i live but i wont eat at them however this one is close to where i work and i will stop in if i feel like a great lunch at a good price the place always gets a large lunch crowd but the waits are minimal and the service is fast   very clean eatery  update  ive been eating lunch at this location for 11 years and have never had a truly bad meal i noticed that some others had but i have always recommended it to others including my wife who can be picky in fast food restaurants and she agrees that the food is quite good especially for the pricecharbroiled oysters are the bomb  dont get 6 get a dozen  tastes like cheese pizza  then the yummy shrimp and oyster po boyim from jersey  this place has the closest thing to a ny bagel in the bay area   plus the women who work there have a bit of an attitude that reminds me of the soup place on seinfeld  it just adds to the charm  go there  like every weekend  enjoyfinally open the livery makes use of the former ipd horse livery and is the newest endeavor by the cunningham group the masterminds who brought mesh bru burger and union 50 to the mass ave area   livery features an extensive tequila menu in both of their bars yeah i said two bars one downstairs and another one upstairs that overlooks a patio thats going to be pretty nice this coming spring   menu features small plates  ceviche yuca fries and jamon serrano top the appetizers with octopus choripan and skirt steak make up the more substantial and higher price point items   for my meal i went with the livery margarita 9 made with maestro dobel diamante lazaroi triplo fresh lime juice and agave add some salt to the rim and this was pretty tasty  i also went with the roaster vegetables with chimichuri a nice and somewhat healthy way to dine   valet parking is a must around here unless you happen to be lucky enough to score a parking spot out front or on mass ave if walking the door is on the north side of the building back a bit   so happy to be neighbors with this place my vip card is going to get athis is the closest grocery store to my home  the employees are very friendly  i have never had any issues  last night the cashier actually inspected the bag of spinach saw that it was wilted and sent the bagger back to get another bag  great customer servicefantastic place to go for coffee in the stpete area a nice calm atmosphere great for studying  reading relaxing and enjoying a great cup of craft coffee check them out worth a visitmy happy place i love frost the gelato in this place is better than anywhere ive ever had it and their coffee and drink options are so spectacular with the calorie and fat being soooo much less than that of its creamier counterpart you seriously cant go wrongits all about the cannoli dont try to share it it wont work you need to order your own id love to try some of their other baked goods but i cant get past that freshly made perfectly crunchy shell with the amazing nottosweet creamy chocolatey chip filling its worth the hassle of trying to find parking and walking sideways to cut through the reading terminal crowdsthis is a great market the beat ive been to in the city   the mixture of stalls is wonderful between fresh vegetables meat eggs as well as farm produce like cheese honey and cider and baked goods fresh teas and coffees available iced for those summer days   the big cheese is great  theres always a line of people hungry for possibly the beat grilled cheese ive ever tasted i also enjoyed scones and shortbread from queens cuisine bread from companion bakery is a must as are popsicles from whisk   theres a great atmosphere here on a saturday morning i also can recommend the free yoga with a donation a great teacher and good atmospherewe spent six wonderful days at hotel mazarin and i have to say that this has been the perfect hotel experience great room wonderful breakfast and every person on staff has been a joy to deal with very close to  but luckily not on  bourbon street and close to everything in the quarter recommended without hesitationi was taking a stroll in no libs today on a quest to find some pokemon in the wild when i found myself famished and in need of some healthy sustenance i got on my trusty yelp app and searched for local gems i saw lots of great reviews for poke bowl and it was close by so i made my way over i had never had poke before and was very excited to try this new trend the selections for protein are mostly raw so if youre not into that theres not much here for you you create your bowl by picking either greens or rice and adding protein 3 or 5 scoops vegetables toppings and sauce they complete the bowl by adding a pretty edible flower this is such a nice touch my bowl was excellent i had rice with octopus shrimp and salmon topped with mango pineapple and a sweet sauce the combination was a stellar one so many great flavors came together for an awesome experience the cost for my small poke bowl and a drink came to about 13 it was a little expensive for a casual lunch but worth the experience deliciouswhat a little neighbourhood gem amazing espresso drinks friendly staff and if you follow their tweets you can salivate over your iphone as you read about their daily breakfastlunch menu yeah its a little as small but ive only done takeaway planning to eat in really isnt an option in the winter without the patio spacethe donuts are inventive and delicious  i had a bacon maple donut on my birthday that made my day  the koloches are amazing  the lattes are always perfect and do not require any sugar  there is so much more that district donuts has to offer that ill have to keep coming back to try other things on their menu  however thus far i get to the counter and cave for donutskolaches every timeso glad there is a zupas in the downtown area great selections of sandwiches soups salads and protein bowls every time i go i always have a hard time deciding what to order pictures below are the chipotle turkey sandwich and mexicali protein bowl delicious id recommend to the management to offer 12 more vegetarian salads love the chocolate covered strawberry with the combo sweet treatohmygoodness  recipe for a great dinner a perfect evening to sit outside  good friend to catch up on gossip  solid beer menu  tasty pizza  small plates galore  nutella gelato i left one happy smiling piggie service was friendly but respectful of our need for space to enjoy our meal would definitely recommend this spot next time im going to walk there with my pup and enjoy pizza in the puppy areai stumbled upon this shelfish shack last year when i was in town for july 4th weekend and immediately i was hooked this place is small and located at the end of the pier parking can be a problem sometimes but i guess you can valet it up front or wait it out when you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them i always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder absolutely the best ive had thus far they also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits overall you can try alot of different fresh shellfish without paying as much as you will other places offereing the same items in their menu now that i write about it  i think im going to go today awesome place good food and service shrimp and grits are to die for pancakes are really good tocp has quickly become a neighborhood favorite dishing out some of the most vibrant and tasteful liquid delights made in our fair city between each visit i have made to cp i feel like they have evolved in their drink and menu choice cp should be a definite stop for any beer nerd looking for a quality brewits been 6 months since my wedding at the piper palm house with butlers pantry catering but i will never forget the wonderful and stressfree time they gave me at first i was a little hesitant about the pph having this one caterer but they absolutely blew me away bridget was fantastic at helping me plan and she was very patient with me since it was my first and hopefully only wedding and i had no idea what to do or expect i dont know much about wedding planning and i quickly realized how difficult it is doing if from another state and so i though that the prices were a teensy bit too much but i would definitely have them cater again  they were extremely attentive to everyones needs and every server was so nice like they were happy to be there they even set up a little twoperson table for me and my husband at the request of my mom at the last minute if that had been me shed been asking i would have definitely been grumbling but they were extremely professional about it at one point i asked them if they could get a vase for my bouquet and they did it with a smile and filled it with water even though my bouquet was fake the girl dumped the water in the plants which was very nice of her everyone had a great time and i was happy that the whole thing was smooth sailing thanks to everyone at butlers pantrylove ted drews ice cream it is very tasty prepare your self though the lines will be long the wait might not be too long though it is absolutely worth the wait the place is a little old and looks dirty but the workers are very nice and fast one thing i would like is more parking overall great place best in towni love this place its a regular weekend brunch destination for our group of friends and we always enjoy our time here theyve occasionally been a little slow getting more coffee or water and have mixed up an order once but they corrected the mistake quicklyi can really only speak for their coffee and the atmosphere but i know ill be back for more i went the other night to meet up with a friend and get some work done and this was the perfect spot they had tons of comfy chairs and a nice quiet area upstairs conducive to productivity my americano was perfect and i cant wait to go back to explore their menu and try out some gelatohad a wonderful time and great food was enjoyed by all in our model a group  excellent service the waiters and waitresses were wonderful and very nice  will be back soon our compliments to the chef 6112016   thanks so much for having us  dianne hunterhad such an amazing first visit here today the staff were very nice and enthusiastic did the entire bottle option for mamosas and it was such a deal breakfast was amazing we will defiantly be going backi have been here many times and ordered the greek salad fish platter chicken and steak sub  the food is always fresh and delicious  the people who work here are super friendly and treat their customer very well  thank yougreat place excellent flavors and fresh toppings that are changed daily  if a topping you want is not out the workers get you what you request  only bad review no indoor seatingoutstanding food store pricey but well worth it if you crave it they have it i love itthis place is adorable i walk into the store and it like ive been transported to a young girls toy box in the best possible way you walk into a glass case of available cupcakes for your choosing the cupcakes are aligned perfectly and all ready to eat  i chose a sundae because it sounds so fun right a cupcake cut in half with ice cream in the middle  yes please   a bonus of this location is the cupcake atm available right outside this allows you to buy the cupcakes that are made fresh that day without walking into the store very fun but dont miss the inside because you just might change your mind on what cupcake to eati gave this 5 stars having lived in chicago and eaten at the best greek restaurants in chicagos greektown for 35 years this is a mirror of my greektown but with much better weather  saginaki flaming cheese was invented at chicagos parthenon restaurant now closed and this the only greek restaunt outside of chicago that perfectly serves it  it helps the owner is good friends with the owner of greek islands and pistaria two of the best in chitown   try the lamb riblets for a starter after the saganaki  you can never go wrong with lamb or whole grilled snapper or seabass washed down with a bottle of boutari naoussa  relax and enjoy a great festive time and stop by there fresh bakery next doorawesome place for rolled ice cream unlimited toppings delicious flavors and the rolled ice cream fills the bowl we went later on a friday night and had no wait loved itthis is one of my favorite stores in the area i could sit here all day talking about it but you have to go for yourselves if you dont like crowds dont go lunchtimes as it gets packed later in the afternoon is cool cheese meat wine bread olives and oil the list goes on and on its not cheap but theres walmart if you want cheap quality comes at a price im afraidwow first of all let me say thank you to the owner and staff the customer service is top notch   my party and i will be regulars   they offer an extensive menu everything from vegan tooh wait the grilled portobellos yes oh my lol   gluten free and the most tasteful seasoned steak   i love this place lol   our party had the vegan tacos with chips and salsaoh the verde salsa is scrumptious just the right tang and temperature  we also had the nachosooooo that cheese lol and the steak quesadilla and holy moly that guacamole lol  all silliness asidetheir food is served with high quality ingredients at good sized portions they are extremely friendly and courteous and the vibe is cool there are tables outside for seating and inside if its too hot out  they do suggest to call ahead for your order because there may be a longer wait time theres a reason why they are so busy     ive been to all but one other authentic spot in tampa and by farthis one is my favorite  thank you xtreme tacos glad you found  your way to tampai usually call before coming in so they can have my order ready to go suzy is so fabulous as she jets around the store in the cart you got it special orders never a problem everyone is very nice and professional highly recommendthis place is absolutely delightful i am seldom able to sneak to this part of the city but when i do and the hour is right i rush here the macrons are always to die for each melting in your mouth even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days the darkness croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume   the harry potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where i purchased a few specialties the tonks chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center the pumpkin pasties went great with a cup of tea i have the mollys meat pie ready to go for my lunch today honestly i could have gotten one of each of the new treats if my budget allowed it  overall this place makes my day each time i visit staff is friendly and the atmosphere is elegant spot onwhile on vacation in santa barbara we happened upon this gem  everything was wonderful but you have to try the cinnamon roll with the vanilla bean glaze  it was amazing  so good that we bought another for our trip home  additionally the breakfast biscuit was outstanding  i loved that it was perfectly proportioned and i love every bite down to the last crumbfantastic atmosphere and delicious food i was in there on saturday afternoon and helped by a very kind and good looking man who was very knowledgeable and efficient  i was a first time visitor but will definitely returnme and my boyfriend stopped here traveling through riverway and it was the best decision we made all weekend we had the fried tofu as an appetizer and we both had the chicken pad thai the food was fresh made from scratch and so tasty it wasnt greasy at all and didnt give that full bloated feeling afterwards the service was impeccable and the prices were great for the portions there is also a separate vegan menu we will be returningi have heard my coworkers mention fried cheese curds before and thought to myself what in the world is a fried cheese curd well today i finally got the chance to find out they are delicious they remind you of fried mozzarella but way better pretty expensive but well worth it if you are trying them for the first time  i also got the smokey ketchup dipping sauce which paired great with the cheese curds i would not recommend eating these often because it is a lot of fried cheese but if you must have some fried cheesy goodness this is the way to go  i will never look at mozzarella sticks the same againwonderful place pumpkin pie cheesecake ice cream was great  700 for 3 people instead of 7 per personamidst a long exciting day of shopping my friend and i worked up quite an appetite so at her suggestion we headed over to 500 degrees  she had been there a number of times before and had great things to say about their food and since im always up for trying new places more recently independent burger joints i happily obliged  i settled on a cheeseburger combo with sweet potato fries and was on the fence about getting a milkshake but opted for a lemonade instead which hit the spot just as well  the burger was incredible as were the fries not too greasy very flavorful and cooked just right  i will stop in again and next time i will get a milkshakecant never go wrong best in stl i love the chocolate chip concrete so many options and variety as well great local business to contribute toclean and delicious food  our waiter ben was terrific  he was pleasant and prompt  id go againfree beer clydesdale informative tour  whats not to likemy husband and i swung by this little cafe and was greeted by the sweetest man ever the cafe is very tiny but super cozy and lovely  we ordered a baklava to share and it was delicious planning to come back next time for lunchi had been planning to visit as i saw all of the positive reviews here and finally went for lunch yesterday  i had the chicken adobo and menudo and it was great the items were seasoned well and was very flavorful  i will definitely go back ofteni stumpled upon gelateria del leone for the first time when i was walking down south grand after dinner one day and i was intrigued by the coffeeshopesque feel of the interior its a really homey place inside with wooden chairs and tables and theres a great patio in the back with a fountain and christmas lights strung about   they have a great variety of flavors and the sizes are very much reasonably priced the small is two flavors and its pretty huge for less than 4 theres a lot of ice cream shops nowadays that charge 5 for a single scoop and its absurd gelateria del leone is not one of those places   they have the normal gelato flavors like lemon raspberry chocolate coffee salted carmel but my favorite is the london fog  an earl grey tea flavor another popular one is the maya spicy chocolate one or something like that try them pick your favorites and you can even order a coffee or drink with it as well  definitely a great spot to hit if youre in the area would recommendthe mayor of ville platte la recommended this place as a spot where i can find an ideal pecan praline or as they say it in the south pekhan prahleen  stepping inside you learn they are award winning and arent hurting for business    folks are happy to advise you on packing storing and traveling with these tasty morsels  remember  dont refrigerate them  yes you can probably find ones made with even more love in less urban areas  it was just easier to access these as we were driving thru the city  they also carry so many flavors  i will say it was a tight space for wheelchairs so navigate cautiouslyfirst time buyer and immediately impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service from david i bought 3 bottles of wine to be shipped to a friend and provided the wrong address after the shipment was delivered david went out of his way to make things right and shipped to the correct address for me i am now a redneck wine fan the staff was super nice and let us try some samples it looked nice and clean in there they have all the speciality favors out in the front and the standard flavors are in the back i really loved my waffle cone with chocolate chip ice cream the cookie monster ice cream was good toobread pudding ahhhhmazing the best ive ever had  also had the eggplant lasagna and greens very good and super fillinggreat new addition to downtown west chester  great prices and variety of flavors to choose fromfantastic the cookies were beautiful and delicious and the customer service was outstanding highly recommend for special occasionsordered online it was super easy and supa fast loved the korean flavor and lemon pepper cajun fries are better than popeyes fries p the hawaiian roll was perfect to calm all that spicy deliciousness would have taken a picture but the food got devoured before i couldone of the best expieriences ive ever had the cooks were friendly with great personalities and the food ugh amazingcostco is a great place to come when you do not have any problems in your life so you need to create one your problem will be that you bought too much cereal at once or maybe big muffins also you might accidentally buy a 32pack of individual hummus cups and then you will eat all of the hummus in 3 days because it is there and you cannot be expected to practice selfcontrol with such a pleasant and flavorful chickpea dip this costco is great because it is full of white people who pretend to be in a hurry they pretend to be in a hurry because that is what everybody else is doing there are also free samples here they are mostly handed out by very large women who have to sit on stools that are just regularsized they have sadness inside of their eyes i think this makes life flash before my eyes real quick because i wonder why they have to do that job i wonder if i will ever have to do that i start to feel sad i wonder how many of the samples they get to eat a lot i hope this costco gives me very bad social anxiety mostly because it is so crowded and everybody is pushing around those giant carts i am afraid of being in the way of one and getting accidentally smashed to death that would not be an ideal way to go this costco has great bathrooms there are lots of stalls so you can still use the bathroom even if someone is in there doing a lot of poop all at once sometimes my mom buys a big churro on the way out of costco she eats it in the car on the way home and asks me if i want some even though she is just eating it like a big corn dog i say no thank you we dont have any more conversations after thatgreat little spot with fresh ice cream pizzas sandwiches and beer the ice cream was amazing and incredibly fresh locally owned so nice to support the community right off the pinellas trail with a nice sized patio so this its really convenient lunch stop on a long ridethe pastries were absolutely delicious and worth every penny  the coffee was decent coffee although overpriced  i do like the clean minimalist design but it was almost too minimalist  the bar style seating at the window is nice  you get some great natural lighting and can watch the passers on central ave  the staff was very friendly  plenty of space in the coffee shop and doesnt feel like an overcrowded starbucks  i would highly recommend this coffee shop  the only reason im not giving it 5 stars is because i thought the price on the coffee was a bit high  important edit  bandit coffee got in touch with me regarding my review  they were appreciative of my response and informed me as to why they charge slightly more for their coffee their vendors are independent companies they pay their employees fairly and a lot of their products that make the coffee and drinks come from local companies or are hand made  knowing all of this makes it well worth the extra 50 cents to a buck for a cup of coffee im not just supporting bandit im supporting other local companies too    5 stars for banditincredibly delicious  we tried it at diablo burger  sugar skull sweet stout abv 52 this craft beer brings all the boys to the yard our use of ecuadorian fair trade organic cacao beans gives this brew a rich dark chocolatey kick the incorporation of lactose sugar offers a soft mouth feel packing a premium punch of flavor into a lightbodied stout  bitterness 205 ibus original gravity  1325 plato color dark chocolate aroma roasted coffee roasted malt distinctions not heavy highly drinkable uses lactose milk sugar and cacao nibsi ordered my sons 1st birthday cake from this shop and it was perfect  it was beautifully decorated delicious tasting and received so many compliments from our guests  additionally the shop itself is beautiful and new and service was friendly other small treats we have picked up chocolate croissants cookies have been delicious  no complaints here and this will be my goto spotone of the best meals i have had in franklin great friends the ketchup is out of the world the service was great perfect drink menu and we got sat very fastvia marconis is always a good time  lots of beers on tap and a robust menu  the pizza is good and the sandwiches make for good pub grubso glad that angela and the gang are still going strong after 2 years delivering wings ribs corn dogs and fabulous fried shrimp to drexelhahnemann students and others  wednesday is 12 price boneless wings and monday is the shrimp deal  love to take my 6 year old here  as i probably should not even contemplate eating this  its an occaisional treat only  and we get celery in lieu of fries  and i get a salad  so i feel a little less guilty  bring on the fried shrimp and corn dogs big and slightly sweet batter  ummi love this taco joint id put the atmosphere right in between the taco bus and red mesa weve been here twice and will continue to return best carnitas tacos and guacamole in town if youve found better please let me know all of their tacos are made with their homemade corn tortillas fillings are plentiful and delicious  dog friendly patio dining  beer wine sangriafood here is tremendous tuna tartar appetizer and salmon off menu were extremely good crab cake special was best crab cake ive ever eaten location is a bit trickygreat place just a local neighborhood place christine the owner she goes way out of her way for you fresh ingredients reasonable and i mean reasonable pricing support small businesses and visit her sometimedelicious fresh chips and guacamole i had the sopa with sausage tostada with spicy chicken and a burrito with carnitas all were excellent the only complaint is that the paper lining the plate ended up in my foodthis place is casual and has a great selection i do not eat meat but there are great healthy dishes for someone like megreat place second time here love the ambience music and wine  pizza is good also  first time here my husband and i came to listen to a friends son who plays in a jazz band we enjoyed the evening so much we had to return brought my motherinlaw back again another wonderful evening have had about 6 different wines from this vineyard and have enjoyed everyone of them will be back and will bring other family members and friends to share with kathleen is

area so anyway happy to be herei love ted drewes any time outoftowner friends visit this is one of the first places i take thembest chinesetaiwanese  food in reno my daughter wolfed down the braised beef noodle soup in minutes i did not even have a chance to try it my other kid cleaned out the fried rice too  i ordered the chicken bento box it was delicious we all shared the tasty and crunchy popcorn chicken we had no leftover definitely will return for more tasty foodi think this is the best ice cream shop in plant city how did i never know about this place its such a hidden jen love the vibe inside also they make their own icecream its divine not to mention all of the other mexican goodies that ive never heard of but i cant wait to come back and try them all yumtook granddaughters for lunch and ice cream awesome grilled cheese great ice cream awesomeone of my favorite spots in tampa ambience is beautiful you can definitely see mexican influence all throughout the restaurant food is great drinks are amazing sue is my favorite server she never fails to be great every time i come and visit i typically dont ask for servers but shes someone i will ask for everytimethe best place for inexpensive wine  not to mention all kinds of food items that you cant find in an ordinary grocery store  i  trader joes i absolutely love this place despite the fancy table settings and moderately expensive food its the least pretentious despite being in montecito this is definitely not the place for a starving student but certainly is if you want to feel like a million bucks the food was amazing some of the best risotto i have had in a long long while youd think you were paying 3050 per plate at this plate but really the prices are much lower than that the staff was very attentive and fancy which was nice for lunch it was pretty quiet in there despite the large family at the table nearby i guess the place would have to be packed and the tons of people out say a weekend night for it to be loud but for lunch it was great my step mom had their burger carbless and says its the best burger shes ever had this is definitely a fancy restaurant pricey for the rest of us lowermiddle class folk but you get that upper upper class feel for upper middle class price so in terms of value vs quality they receive 5 stars for me cordial attentive customer service very polite responsive and quick service try the risotto with mozzarella and chicken its amazing the fetuchinne con mare e monti was also delish as well so if you want to blow some money on absolutely yummo food and feel its more than worth it come here best part  you can go casual toothe best chicken sandwich ever i am addicted to the big mary combo i get tatters and macaroni salad this location has the best chicken poppers and the best dipping sauce is the honey mustard the gravy is drink worthy lol seriously lolthe philly pretzel factory makes the best philly pretzels around the company has various locations so wherever you are in the tristate area you wont be too far from one of their stores this location is right off of 70 in a small strip mall  there is parking in front of the store and to the side the staff here is very friendly and willing to help in addition to selling pretzels ppf offers a few other treats one of my favorite being the pretzel dogs   philly pretzels are perfect for parties and ppf makes it easy with two tray size options for their nuggets sticks or mini pretzels they ask for a days notice on party orders they can also make custom pretzel designs letters run 1 eachwhat is not to love about sherbrooke liquor store seriously the best selection of beer in town as well as a pretty awesome selection of spirits as well  the liquor store location is anything but ideal  the surrounding shops are a bit suspect and the area isnt one of the better ones in the city  this is where my complaining is going to stop  once you walk into the doors the staff are usually very good about greeting you  the sliding door to the beer cooler is immediately on the right  bring your warm coat its cold in the cooler    the cooler is chock a block full of beer some wine and sake  the space between the shelving is very narrow and usually there isnt enough room to even get past someone else  the shelves are floor to over 6 ft and full of various beers  they have done a pretty good job of grouping the different beers ie local seasonal pilsners fruitflavour etc  there are a few tags on the various beers in each section that highlight staff picks and hidden gems  which is always welcome as you get to try something that someone else thinks is a winner    the remainder of the liquor store the heated part isnt as crammed as the beer cooler but still offers up a fairly big selection of different spirits and wines    overall sherbrooke is going for uniqueness and not quantity  the beer selection is by far the best in the city  they also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits  some of the spirits can be had for less if you are going for the more common ones the ones that can be found elsewhere  ive had several conversations with different staff and they are all very helpful and will help guide you if you need assistance   this is my goto for beerdont let the big crowd scare you awaythese people know what they are doing the line moves fast check out the menu on the side of the building so you know what you want when you order the custard concretes were delicious we had to reeses and one oreo the prices are fair for what you getjust eat it fast bc it melts quicklybakery house makes my favorite cakes ever my mom still surprises me with one every year for my birthday always vanilla with vanilla buttercream frosting theyre fantastic better than any other cakes ive ever had their designs tend to be pretty basic nothing intricate or entirely special my mom always orders the cakes so i cant speak to their customer service ive tried a few other things over the years lemon bars cupcakes blondies and everything is always amazing their cakes freeze exceptionally well its crazy try their cakes you wont be sorryone of the best seafood places not in new orleans i used to get the blackened chicken salad but this time i tried the swordfishamazing the service was great diana was quick and professional will be back again as alwaysthe food  service is magnificent they make everything fresh  made to order you want it fast try mcdonalds food was out in less than 10 delicious burger  hot dog all negative reviews must be people who are mad at lifei love love iron hill in voorhees food is always great and such a great selection of beers on tapa nashville landmark and obligatory stop on the toursit circuit they say you will see celebrities here i once saw kevin costner  the line is outrageously long but it actually moves pretty fast and it is actually worth it  best pancakes ive ever had  go with a group so you can each order a different pancake conconction they are all so intriguing and it is impossible to decide  i like waking up before 7 on a sunday to beat the crowd and going there with the paper  service is very friendly in an authentic warm southern waygreat brewery this was the 201st brewery my husband and i have been to and it ranks right up there great beer great vibe friendly and knowledgeable staff and perhaps most telling of all there was a diverse crowd of beer drinkers  not only young or older or men or women looking forward to returning in the summer chilling outside and making new friendsthis is not the place for vanilla ice cream with fudge sauce go to your grocerys frozen food section for that yeah the flavours sound odd to the average ice cream consumer but omg you will go in and can proclaim you will die happy after leaving try the raspberry white chocolate flan and fried banana well anything is good on the menu i would know about 40 of us showed both times i went and the place was already packed service was slow but still friendly and definitely well worth the waitlove this place the atmosphere is very laid back and the lavender vanilla latte was delicious perfect place to study or relax with a bookdelicious their house milk tea is to die for they have two types of milk tea one is the original i think thats the name and the second is the house milk tea the house milk tea has a mellower flavor and not too sweet the original one is a bit spicier and much sweeter if you dont have a sweet tooth go for the house tea also i have gotten great service both times i have been here dont be afraid to ask them to adjust the sweetness   the only issue i have with this place is that they dont have a location near me so i have to drive about 20 minutes to get there  but that might be a good thing for my wallet since i would probably be here every day multiple times a day if it was near my housechecked this place out as soon as i landed in nashville there was a bit of a line going out of the door but it went by fairly quickly id say 1520 minutes once we were seated the service was pretty quick and friendly i ordered hot chocolate with marshmallows to drink and it was so delicious best hot chocolate ive had in awhile i also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of potatoes and was very pleased great food and servicethis is exactly type of saintpetersburg russia coffee places i miss so much here chill music nice choice no salads only coffee and tea and small amount of bakery nice stuff fast service delicious food stylish menu and look thank youfive words peanut butter chocolate milk stout dear gawd i love this stuff keep in mind i was skeptical i usually stick with single speed which is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum but when literally every other person you are with is drinking this reeses cup beer you eventually take a sip and discover that it is delicious and you kick single speed to the curb and end up roaming around randalls like a crazy person until the nice girl stocking beer notices you and carries over a bottle asking is this what youre looking for and you want to hug her but i digress  if you cant track down the peanut butter their regular chocolate milk stout runs a close second in my book and this is coming from someone who is not a big fan of dark beers maybe my taste buds are changing with old age who knows i have my fingers crossed that they wont take it away as the weather warms up  the tasting room is probably one of my current favorite spaces its all concrete and metal a distressed wood and an awesome wall of custom wallpaper its a stencil its gets crazy crowded in here on weekends but the bartenders are efficient and it never takes long to get a refill they also have limited seating outside on the sidewalk which is awesome on warm days and they generally have an amazing soundtrack going   if drinking round after round of beer gives you the drunk munchies no just me you can grab a snack from fifth wheel which is basically a tiny baileys kitchen that offers up nachos pretzels and other pub fare to go along with your beer order and pay at the window and they come find you when youre food is readyquick service good coffee   they actually have coffeelates on tap like in a keg on nitro and let me try a sample  delicious  atmosphere is great  all in all a very cool coffee placeamazing food super flavorful with every bite definitely coming back here highly recommend the platter and butter naangood price and very tasty i called ahead to order for pickup the restaurant is just a few minutes down the road from me so thats another bonus i saw all the good reviews and rating so i had to give it a try i got there right before a rush and was waiting for my food and talking to memo who works there hes very friendly i was glad i got there when i did because four more customers came in memo was very nice and helped them with the menu and gave suggestions i got home and chowed down on two steak tacos and a buffalo chicken taco totally delicious try this place youll love ithighly recommend this costco store service i bought the tires online and took in my car for them to be installed and they didnt fit the manager got a more expensive tire set comped for free and personally went out to get them from another warehouse just so i could have my car back within the same dayamazing food ridiculously high quality ingredients definitely will come back whenever i get a chanceexcellent brews nice area provided to enjoy the productabsolutely adore this place we were stopped yesterday by a man giving out samples and went right inside after sampling their amazing product we ended up purchasing white cheddar chipotle oreo explosion and peanut butter blast popcorn the staff was really pleasant and recommended great flavors we will definitely be returning during our next day trip to new hopezeppoli is the best restaurant around  i came here for dinner friday night as i have many times in the past   let me start off by saying that the food at zeppoli has never been anything but outstanding all of the dishes are wonderful but i have to tell you that the antipasto is a must there are usually about 10 different elements on the board including vegetables meats cheeses and salads like tuna and white bean some of my personal favorites are the butternut squash agrodolce and the stuffed peppers it is a really fun and interactive way to start off the meal and doesnt leave you feeling too full  the pasta is what makes this place a true gem all of the pastas are homemade and they usually have 1 or 2 specials every night all of the pasta creations are worth trying but the ricotta gnocchi will change your life before zeppoli i had never had a ricotta base gnocchi and now i cant seem to enjoy regular potato gnocchi anymore they are like eating little clouds the brown butter sauce and crispy sage are the perfect accompaniment if the squid ink pasta is ever on special when you go be sure to get it  the space itself is tiny but very romantic and intimate with just enough room around each table for the servers to pass through sometimes i feel like im sitting on top of other diners which may be an issue for some but its never bothered me  that brings me to the service sadly my favorite waiter tom no longer works here he was unbelievably knowledgeable and great at his job i have not been back here for dinner since he left so i was really anxious to see if the other servers had stepped it up fortunately they did and we experienced great service the whole night   i cannot wait to come back again soon now that i live in the area its going to be to be hard not to spend all of my money here incredible food and a small 7 platter is two meals worth for me  greens beans and rice jerk chicken or friedcant go wrong with saganaky and the gyro delicious pita bread best greek salad ive ever had with potato salad in the middle i would come back just for the salad save room for the bakery that is connected many greek desserts that dont disappointi love this place the environment is very urban and homey and since you can see whats cooking literally in front of you you know youre getting the freshest of coffee and they roast their beans in house so in short its a great place with great coffee only downfall is that coffee is pricey but thats the price you pay for the whole shebang i guesswe were a few minutes late but they still added us on to the tour and caught is up to the group  we had an awesome guide  very friendly and personable  great beer sampling at the end  you get two free samples  they also have a gift shop  and they sell wing sauce  i didnt try it but it looked amazing  would highly recommendi really enjoy their breakfast sandwiches  reasonable prices selma is always delightful friendly staff great local bagel shop lots of cream cheese varieties and fresh baked donutsfood was great and we had a large party so they put us up in sportys pub the crab cakes and crab balls were good really good time and would recommend to anyone just walking aroundyum yum yummmmm on a recent trip we stopped off at santa barbara shellfish company for lunch we ordered the rock crab chowder in a bread bowl and the onion rings everything was so good   of course my favorite was the rock crab there was so much crab meat and it was buttery and sweet it melted in my mouth and the onion rings were battered to perfection the chowder  bread bowl was warm and delicious   cant wait for another trip to sb to have lunch again  although i think i traumatized my daughter when she saw how the crabs were killed loltanya and matt took over from i think it was a tcby and have really created a local following for this nice little shop i have to admit that ice cream is my down fall and they have enough flavors to keep an ice cream snob like myself happy and if you are looking for something a little healthier then you can go low cal yogurt they have just about every type of topping that you can think of they have had live music on the weekends and they even have a little play area for the kids plus some nice chairs to sit outside if the weather permits oh and if you are hiding your fetish for ice cream they have a drive through so you can wear dark glasses and no one will know its you not that i have do that overall its a great experiencethis place is the best unbelievable foodspectacular service poboys are better than a lot of the ones ive had in new orleans everything here is authentic and heartfelt one of the great dining experiences that delco has to offerthis is a great mexican restaurant  delicious authentic food and very good service  i will certainly return next time i go to st louisi love this place from the wonderful wine selection to the friendly staff i always leave with a smile and a newly discovered bottle of wine prices are fantastic and you can find some fabulous wines for under 10 they also have a nice craft beer selection with lots of local favorites this is my favorite wine shop and i highly recommend it   best wine shop in south tampathe cinnamon roll is to die for seriously must get also loved the breakfast buns stuffed with sausage and baconhad my first ted drewes concrete this week   turtlemmmmmm really rich but good  went back because i heard they sold dry ice and needed some for the trip home  nice folks and highly recommend you stop by on your trip to st louissuper friendly awesome gyros with fresh pita  i lived several years in greece and although theres no substitute for the real thing this is close  in addition the place is spot on clean   well be back oftengelato is always a favorite on a hot tucson day and frost is the place to get it  when you walk inside their counter is a showcase of delightful flavors and you can have as many tastes as you want before deciding what to purchase  they also serve shakes root beer floats and other confections none of which i have tried  the only downside to this location is that there are only two or three small tables inside  being that this is a popular spot in the summer the tables fill up quickly and you are relagated to sitting outside at tables that are shaded but still in the heat even so it is worth a trip when you are in the mood for a yummy treat  this is a family owned business that is just starting to offer franchises and expand into other locationsthis is a great place for breakfast when you are visiting montecito  the greek omelet is amazing the bloody mary is perfect and the service is attentive and fast  it is an elegant but casual place with cloth napkins on the tables and nice decorations   i would recommend getting reservations for larger groupsgreat coffee and atmosphere lots of seating options depending on your needs they have a small selection of sweets and they are good small parking lot on the side but plenty of street parking as wellthis is my idea of heaven  i dream of a yelp event in which i get to sample everything and it is one of the best days of my life  dont get me wrong they do give samples but i would drive them up a wall let me try the snow now the milk tea now the green tea ice cream now one of each flavor  please dont hang me  im not a fan of the tapioca balls  rather i am an lychee jelly person  i tried the aloe which was similar to chucks of jello but it had nothing on my lychee jelly  my husband loves the popping boba  i usually get the taro or the cantaloupe slush  just typing them made me want to hop in my car for a brain freeze  ive also been down the kiwi road while good it was on borderline artificial tasting  i also sampled the egg custard and i think i can get behind that  now while i am sans the vitamix and the super cool machine that seals your beverage with adorable kawaii characters i had the brilliant idea at lee lees to pick up some boba powder  mistake  leave the boba to the experts    if you ever want to loose at a game of jenga while enjoying some bings  im there  also pm me with your favorite combos  i say lets have uye at bings to see who can concoct the most tasty beverage and enjoy a boba smorgasbordgreat little coffee shop with surprisingly ample seating this gets 5stars for the fact that they have the best coffee at the cheapest place in the area the specialty drinks are large and delicious as wellloved the salmon poke bowl that i get here  weve been two times so far and really love the freshness of the fish not to mention nicesized cuts and the sushi rice  and the easy drivethru makes this our current goto spot  excited to go eat there next weeknoting in central jersey can compare to the bagels coming out of rolings real ny style that is hard to find even in ny these days  luck me that my inlaws live a few blocks away  come early and get them hot  no two look the samegreat atmosphere  service and food  love the menu simple yet options are full of lots of flavor prices are great and food came out fresh and yummy very refreshing option from the local compition from what i saw at leasthello schlafly was in stl for the day and wanted to take my newlyturned21yearoldsister to a brewery being the day after christmas other breweries in the area were closed i wont drop any names so looking for a quick alternative i stumbled upon schlafly i didnt know much about the brewery itself i knew my stl classmates from college always ordered schlafly at the bars and i found out quickly why so its comparable to boulevard reppin kc though smaller in size and production we stopped in for a tour tours start at the top of the hour and it was the quickest brewery tour ever no complaints here considering that meant we got to the tasting quicker the tour was super fast as i mentioned and we literally just walked back and forth in the back production area while our tour guide who was very knowledgable witty and interesting gave us a quick rundown of their plant and how beer is made the coolest part as always was the tasting at the end of the tour we tried their oktoberfest summer lager export ipa and lastly by request of another tour member their coffee stout the coffee stout was delish and my sisters favorite out of the ones we tried the tasting was super chill and casual very intimate with our small tour group all of which i enjoyed afterwards my sis and i bought some souvenirs wish they had a better packaging system for their souvenir glasses we just had them put into a 6pack container and were sent off souvenirs were decently priced i saw they had a restaurant in the building but didnt get a chance to check it out this time around im happy we stumbled upon this little gem loved itawesome service  incredible food and beer  like others have said we walked in the front door and the hostess was several booths beyond    friendly and quick service if your want a unique take on a traditional burger give this place a shot  a perfectly cooked burger and all the fixings inside a thinner pizza crust delicious best food yetbest pizza i have had in a long time the lunch special was a really good value 10 for a small pizza choice of salad and a soda the crust was great the sauce was really flavorful i love that you can see the pizza oven when you walk in the door i will remember this place the next time im in town for lunchawesome bubble tea im from boston and never thought id ever be able to find quality bubble tea in the midwest   their yogurt is great tooi absolutely love this place the food is superb the wine is great the atmosphere is cozy but still feels trendy ive been here several times now and each time we closed the place down its just a great place to sit enjoy your meal and have a long conversation with your friends one of my favorite dishes is the skirt steak 17 its a tasty perfectly seasoned cut of meat just the right amount of salt and fat and lime on it i tried the chicken empanada and the mushroom one and by far liked the chicken one better ive also enjoyed the paella with shrimp which i had during devour indy my only complaint was that the serving was a little small for me and i was still hungry afterwards but the delicious chocolate flan and the churros that followed that meal remedied that problem i would recommend this place to anyone whether its for a business meeting or an evening out with friendswent here 2nd night they were open and it was great  the beers were fabulous and the staff was great  if they had food id have stayed longeri love this place  great fresh pasta made onsite and a very complete wine offering  i will continue to support this place  we always bring friends here when in town from other places around the country all are impressedwe live in the neighborhood so it is good for us that the food is very good prices are better than we would expect for the quality our japanese friend wants to go whenever he is in towni seriously ate pralines all over the new orleans area airport included and the original pralines here were the best i have ever had theyre light sweet and creamy with the perfect amount of crunch i definitely made my way into this shop every time we passed i also had a peanut butter covered oreoyes you read that correctly yumm not sure it was an actual oreo but id definitely eat it again oh the peanut butter pralines tasted like pb fudge sample everything buy many there were so many other delicious treats to choose from it was hard to pick just dont forget to take something homewhats not to love about a boba tea place that offers bobas multiple ways slush ice milk and tea i had a yummy handmade mango slush boba tea with purple tapioca balls and my wife had leechee with bobas theres no other place to get cool flavors like this plus you can have flavored jellies instead of bobas  we had finished dinner at ikkyu and walked down the strip mall to bings and found the proprietor who had been to china japan hong kong and california  all boba tea capitals   at last we northsiders have a place for boba tea bings is at 2040 w orange grove rd at the corner of lacholla next to the fabulous lee lee asian market we took our boba teas and shopped in the market  other flavors include matcha which is green tea and taro which is a mild sweet potato you can also get vanilla strawberry and other standard flavors drinks come in 16 and 24 ounces  plenty to give you a brain freeze
