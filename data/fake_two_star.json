a snoozer place but we are not snoozing anymore    today we decided to go back to the station and stop in to try to figure out what we wanted to try   i didnt know what we wanted to try  i had no idea what we were getting into and just wanted to sit down for a quick bite and try something new   we ended up at a fish and chips sandwich and were told to sit out there until we got a drink or two the manager told us to sit in the back of the station we were told to sit and we never got a drink or two    we finally got our drink and went to the line and made our way back to the station  i waited for 30 minutes before getting my drinks and when we finally got our drinks   we got our food and a few minutes later the manager finally apologized to us and said we are sorry for the wait but we can give the manager another chance     we are going back to wait in line after a long wait for dessert    we will be back in a few days to go    the food was good lite with a touch of saltiness i ordered a vegan side and no icing    the service was top notch  the employees were extremely friendly and friendly  the food was good      the location was pretty good but it did not have a lot of food  it was pretty pricey and we were not used to seeing a lot of fancy restaurants in the area   the room was just empty at the moment  i saw the gentleman with the phone and said \"we got you there but we want to make you a sandwich and a beer  i just want to ask you to call us and say you want the sandwich  it was just me and he came by and said i was going to make a sandwich and beer      the sandwich was very good and the beer was very good but it was just me and he came by and said i was going to make the sandwich and then i said youre supposed to call me and say you want the beer and i just want to call you and say you want that beer and i just want to call", "i want to know what kind of people the real love for this place is from the coffee leaf and i am a coffee lover so we all know that a real coffee leaf is a good thing for a coffee lover  but i dont want to give my opinion because i have friends who love the place also dont give my opinion because i have a better friend who loves the coffee not the coffee leaves but the coffee leaf i dont think i need to give my opinion to give a better opinion of any coffee or coffee shops in the area and they dont have the same flavor or type of coffee  theres a new staff who are able to give me a better sampling of the coffee here  i am not a fan of coffee shops in the area  theres a new staff who are able to give me a better sampling of the coffee here", "pretty decent ice cream but the kids were pretty much all in it at this point and the kids were basically all in it at this point and the kids were basically all in it at this point and the kids were basically all in it at this point but it would have been better if they had just taken a chance and offered a little more to it after the kids had had their ice cream they may still have a chance but it would have been better to give the kids a chance if they hadnt as i mentioned at", "not pet friendly which is fun to watch but you gotta watch your back and you cannt be the only one out the door  it wasnt the worst thing about the whole place but the food wasnt good  the service was bad  the staff had a good", "food was nothing special i thought the
