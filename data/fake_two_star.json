for their guests but i would not recommend this place to anyone who is not comfortable with the food or who amuses others to see people eating there                                    i had the peanut butter rolls and the peanut butter cinnamon rolls were good but the cinnamon rolls were very sweet and the cinnamon rolls were much too sweet the peanut butter rolls were great but the cinnamon rolls

asked if its about ice pudding  they said that the ice pudding is not available in their store but that they do make the treats  i asked if they sell the frozen treats  they said that they do and they do  i asked if they sell the frozen treats ", "yummy but the staff refused to give me a drink and the whole place smelled and smelled like the floor had been cooked and the food was horrible the only reason was that it was kind of warm and the only reason for the mistiness was that they cleaned the place up after a couple of times they did not clean the floor and inside the place it smelled like they were just dirty and uninteresting   the bartender is a great dude but he cant be trusted  i was going to", "overpriced but hey their in a better place because you get free drinks if you dont mind

cake    i was really excited about this item but the quality was a bit overpriced   here is the review  its a pretty decent quality cake with some decent textures but the actual goodness is just a bit overpriced  this cake was a bit too big and over sized  the only reason for the price difference is that this was a very small size but we would have preferred a smaller size for the price   we have had better quality cake this year   will hire someone else to work with this one    i would have preferred that they give you an artist who can come up with a more creative approach", "this place really isnt that bad as i ordered a chicken sandwich and it came out pretty good and the waitress was nice and helpful or seemed to be a bit annoyed with the conversation i have had there the food was", "my husband and i stopped by this place for dinner at the local coffee house in the middle of the night i was very disappointed with the service i was there for two groups of four for a meal and both were taken for the food  i would not recommend here    the food was totally not fresh and just not fresh at all  the staff was friendly and helpful and the food was decent  the chicken was great

lady or just a tourist looking for an interesting experience i would have preferred for the food  i have heard the food is good but thats not my experience  i would have liked more of a point of view or something to make the experience more interesting   this restaurant has their own menu but at this time they can only serve the meat bread and meatballs   i will not be returning here if i dont find the food   share this restaurant with someone else  i just hope someone else finds it helpful  i would suggest going here if you want to get a brisket sandwich and a potato salad   i had a hard time finding anything else on", "food was excellent server was super nice and the atmosphere was nice ive been here twice and the service was pretty bad last time they werent friendly and they said this was a bad day ive had better options elsewhere ive had better cuisines and i have not had any good experiences  the place is convenient but the food isnt there ive had better options elsewhere i dont think it was the quality of the food that was the biggest issue but that was it  the restaurant was in a bad mood and i had no idea it was here until i went there last weekend and the atmosphere was warm and inviting ive been to this place before but it was the new one and the food was just ok  the waitress made a nice suggestion to do something to get our order and she would still be there when we got our food but it was less than 30 minutes later and instead of checking out the menu we chose to go out to the doorman and ask for a reservation  ", "ordered online through yelp and i dont

the rest of my life im not sure how the concept of the restaurant came to be what we do now and how we have to grow and improve and then if we want to continue to grow and improve we have to offer the best service in our community i do not care if you", "poor at best had the sushi and the fluffy rolls were so fluffy and so good the only thing that was wrong was ok today was really busy but in the past it's been busy because of the crowded market and the poor attitude of the customers the food was good but has not been going well i like that it has a sushi restaurant but i do not like it with this type of thing ive not had much of a good meal ive had very good chocolate chip cookies but they are not good ive eaten a lot of cheetos and", "this place has been featured on some other sites and recently indeed they have opened their doors to the public and i am not even sure if i should call them or not but i felt compelled to call it because i am part of the area and i am always looking for new groups to visit and the food is good but i feel like in the past it was different and was just a new experience for me to try this place again and i hope it is to get better the website and location is nice but not great the service is friendly and the food is good but i dont think it is worth the money ive eaten at least two or three times here and it was mediocre and not at all", "after reading the reviews we were disappointed and will not be back again at the mall as we have not been to them in awhile as far as our place is concerned it is a great place to go for breakfast and lunch but the food is not good at all since i ordered breakfast it was going to be a meal that evening and we were hoping for a nice little appetizer but after trying to eat it was very disappointing the bread was not good even the bread and cheese was too sweet and the potato chips were too cold and burnt we couldnt eat them and they werent the same as the ones in the store ive tried many other places in the area and had the same issues but this one is the worst", "the food is over rated although i enjoyed it ive eaten there twice and it was over priced  despite the hype a lot of people seem to think that this is the best place in the city to get a drink in the winter  the place is not that bad in the winter  the bar is reasonably clean  the food is good  the service is decent  the decor is pretty nice  a little bit of something or other in the background but it is much more entertaining than the rest of the city  the only bad thing about this place is that it is pretty expensive   i ordered the chicken sandwich with the garlic bread and a side of fries  in fact the sandwich was really good  the fries with the chicken were also good  the bread was pretty good too  the fries were a little cold  the experience was over cooked  i was happy with the experience  definitely not a place to eat here    on the other hand i was not into that place and would not recommend it to anyone else   the owner is very nice and had a nice conversation with me he also said that he would not be able to send my order i agreed but that still leaves me with a hard case for the purchase of some product  he also turned down my request to go to the doctor for a prescription when i asked for his prescription  the pharmacy gave me that suggestion but i was still very disappointed     i will not be returning here     but the service is good  the food is ok  but really not good  the drinks are usually served hot and i am not sure if it was because the wait staff or just some quality of service           i will not be coming back here     the food was high quality  but the service is pretty terrible  i had the beef brisket and the lamb it was the same as the brisket but your average brisket but with beef and not the lamb it was not as good as the lamb and the lamb was a bit more of a red flag           i wasnt impressed with the chicken  it was dry and was very greasy  the chicken was overcooked in the chicken broth and was a little dry          i now don't know where to start but hopefully this review got better and that i would recommend this place  but i will not be returning          i just want to say that i was very disappointed with the food at the hostess place  she said she was at a friend place for dinner and i didnt know what to expect  the food was good the waitress was pretty nice and the dessert was good    a friend ordered a bowl of corned beef with a side of scallop  i was very surprised  she went to get a glass of wine  and she was very helpful  i did not have much to say about the beef  i had a couple of meat cuts but they were smaller than the ones i had  i also had a large portion of the scallop portion  i was disappointed  the dish was very high priced  i ordered the shrimp enchilada  salads  and grilled chicken ", "i wanted to like izumi wasnt a good employee she brought the chicken burrito to me and it was super bland and dry it was good and flourishes made it look like an old roll and it was not even all that good the chicken wasnt as good as the roll it had been cooked and the chicken was just too dry and mushy to eat with the rice syrup the chicken tasted like it had been wiped down the chicken felt like it was made with the same old bread that had been packed in the same bag because it was also packed with flour      i would have gone back to the business to try again but i have been so disappointed by the service that i will not go back there againthis place is pretty good  the food i ordered was good but not great  the chicken was dry and the sauce and all the toppings were dry ", "the chick that works here is an actual chick who works here and we are friends and we have had the

option is to go to a casino and not bother going there   a third option is to go to an inn and not bother going there   the good news is that they have a place called the inn that was pretty good but

has done nothing to make you feel at home and that is something you will certainly never get back from   the place is quite nice though  the food is amazing  the service is outstanding and i will be
